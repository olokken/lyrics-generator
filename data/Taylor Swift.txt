I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sisters house
And youve still got it in your drawer, even now
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
Were singin in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know its long gone and
That magics not here no more
And I might be okay, but Im not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh
Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red cause you were lookin over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mothers tellin stories bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me bout your past, thinkin your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, Fuck the patriarchy
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin town
And I was thinkin on the drive down, Any time now
Hes gonna say its love, you never called it what it was
Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin its the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

And I know its long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to
Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
Were dancin round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and wed swear
To remember it all too well, yeah
Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece til you tore it all up
Runnin scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein honest
Im a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin here
Cause I remember it all, all, all
They say alls well that ends well, but Im in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it wouldve been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin in a party bathroom
Some actress askin me what happened, you
Thats what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin coffee like youre on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin you to come
And he said, Its supposed to be fun turning twenty-one
Time wont fly, its like Im paralyzed by it
Id like to be my old self again, but Im still tryin to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You cant get rid of it
Cause you remember it all too well, yeah
Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing youve ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
And I was never good at tellin jokes, but the punch line goes
Ill get older, but your lovers stay my age
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
Im a soldier whos returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
Cause in this citys barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well
Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it (All too well)
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there

Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
But I knew you
Dancin in your Levis
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someones bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite
A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and
Giving me your weekends, I
I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes, I
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someones bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite
To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now Im bleedin
Cause I knew you
Steppin on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy, I
I knew you
Leavin like a father
Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing
But I knew youd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew youd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew Id curse you for the longest time
Chasin shadows in the grocery line
I knew youd miss me once the thrill expired
And youd be standin in my front porch light
And I knew youd come back to me
Youd come back to me
And youd come back to me
And youd come back
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someones bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite169Embed
I can see you standing, honey
With his arms around your body
Laughin, but the jokes not funny at all
And it took you five whole minutes
To pack us up and leave me with it
Holdin all this love out here in the hall
I think Ive seen this film before
And I didnt like the ending
Youre not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town, now Im in exile, seein you out
I think Ive seen this film before
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I can see you starin, honey
Like hes just your understudy
Like youd get your knuckles bloody for me
Second, third, and hundredth chances
Balancin on breaking branches
Those eyes add insult to injury

I think Ive seen this film before
And I didnt like the ending
Im not your problem anymore
So who am I offending now?
You were my crown, now Im in exile, seein you out
I think Ive seen this film before
So Im leaving out the side door
So step right out, there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you
All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didnt even hear me out (You didnt even hear me out)
You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
All this time
I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)
I couldnt turn things around (You never turned things around)
Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
So many signs, so many signs
You didnt even see the signs
I think Ive seen this film before
And I didnt like the ending
Youre not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town, now Im in exile, seein you out
I think Ive seen this film before
So Im leavin out the side door
So step right out, there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you
All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didnt even hear me out (Didnt even hear me out)
You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
All this time
I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)
I couldnt turn things around (You never turned things around)
Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
You never gave a warning sign (All this time)
(So many times) I never learned to read your mind
(So many signs) I couldnt turn things around (I couldnt turn things around)
Cause you never gave a warning sign (You never gave a warning sign)

We could leave the Christmas lights up til January
And this is our place, we make the rules
And theres a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out and take me home
Youre my, my, my, my lover
We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And Im highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
Ive loved you three summers now, honey, but I want em all
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out and take me home (Forever and ever)
Youre my, my, my, my lover

Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My hearts been borrowed and yours has been blue
Alls well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And youll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, Ill save you a seat, lover
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out and take me home (Forever and ever)
Youre my, my, my, my
Oh, youre my, my, my, my
Darling, youre my, my, my, my lover132Embed
Im doing good, Im on some new shit
Been saying yes instead of no
I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didnt though
I hit the ground running each night
I hit the Sunday matinée
You know the greatest films of all time were never made
I guess you never know, never know
And if you wanted me, you really shouldve showed
And if you never bleed, youre never gonna grow
And its alright now
But we were something, dont you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It wouldve been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it wouldve been fun
If you wouldve been the one
(Ooh)
I have this dream youre doing cool shit
Having adventures on your own
You meet some woman on the internet and take her home
We never painted by the numbers, baby
But we were making it count
You know the greatest loves of all time are over now

I guess you never know, never know
And its another day waking up alone
But we were something, dont you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It wouldve been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it wouldve been fun
If you wouldve been the one
I, I, I persist and resist the temptation to ask you
If one thing had been different
Would everything be different today?
We were something, dont you think so?
Rosé flowing with your chosen family
And it wouldve been sweet
If it couldve been me
In my defense, I have none
For digging up the grave another time
But it wouldve been fun
If you wouldve been the one
(Ooh)101Embed
Salt air, and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers of Are you sure?
Never have I ever before
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
Cause you were never mine
Your back beneath the sun
Wishin I could write my name on it
Will you call when youre back at school?
I remember thinkin I had you
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
Cause you were never mine

Back when we were still changin for the better
Wanting was enough
For me, it was enough
To live for the hope of it all
Cancel plans just in case youd call
And say, Meet me behind the mall
So much for summer love and saying us
Cause you werent mine to lose
You werent mine to lose, no
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
Cause you were never mine
Cause you were never mine
Never mine
But do you remember?
Remember when I pulled up and said Get in the car
And then canceled my plans just in case youd call?
Back when I was livin for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
Meet me behind the mall
(Remember when I pulled up and said Get in the car)
(And then canceled my plans just in case youd call?)
(Back when I was livin for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)
(Meet me behind the mall)
Remember when I pulled up and said Get in the car

I dont like your little games
Dont like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool, no, I dont like you
I dont like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isnt cool, no, I dont like you (Oh)
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
Ive got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

I dont like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me
You asked me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast (What?)
The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on, but one things for sure
Maybe I got mine, but youll all get yours
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
Ive got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined

Betty, I wont make assumptions
About why you switched your homeroom, but
I think its cause of me
Betty, one time I was riding on my skateboard
When I passed your house
Its like I couldnt breathe
You heard the rumors from Inez
You cant believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
Im only seventeen, I dont know anything
But I know I miss you
Betty, I know where it all went wrong
Your favorite song was playing
From the far side of the gym
I was nowhere to be found
I hate the crowds, you know that
Plus, I saw you dance with him

You heard the rumors from Inez
You cant believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
Im only seventeen, I dont know anything
But I know I miss you
I was walking home on broken cobblestones
Just thinking of you when she pulled up like
A figment of my worst intentions
She said James, get in, lets drive
Those days turned into nights
Slept next to her, but
I dreamt of you all summer long
Betty, Im here on your doorstep
And I planned it out for weeks now
But its finally sinkin in
Betty, right now is the last time
I can dream about what happens when
You see my face again
The only thing I wanna do
Is make it up to you
So I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party
Will you have me? Will you love me?
Will you kiss me on the porch
In front of all your stupid friends?
If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?
Will it patch your broken wings?
Im only seventeen, I dont know anything
But I know I miss you
Standing in your cardigan
Kissin in my car again
Stopped at a streetlight
You know I miss you93Embed
You booked the night train for a reason
So you could sit there in this hurt
Bustling crowds or silent sleepers
Youre not sure which is worse
Because I dropped your hand while dancing
Left you out there standing
Crestfallen on the landing
Champagne problems
Your moms ring in your pocket
My picture in your wallet
Your heart was glass, I dropped it
Champagne problems
You told your family for a reason
You couldnt keep it in
Your sister splashed out on the bottle
Now no ones celebrating
Dom Pérignon, you brought it
No crowd of friends applauded
Your hometown skeptics called it
Champagne problems
You had a speech, youre speechless
Love slipped beyond your reaches
And I couldnt give a reason
Champagne problems

Your Midas touch on the Chevy door
November flush and your flannel cure
This dorm was once a madhouse
I made a joke, Well, its made for me
How evergreen, our group of friends
Dont think well say that word again
And soon theyll have the nerve to deck the halls
That we once walked through
One for the money, two for the show
I never was ready so I watch you go
Sometimes you just dont know the answer
Til someones on their knees and asks you
She wouldve made such a lovely bride
What a shame shes fucked in the head, they said
But youll find the real thing instead
Shell patch up your tapestry that I shred
And hold your hand while dancing
Never leave you standing
Crestfallen on the landing
With champagne problems
Your moms ring in your pocket
Her picture in your wallet
You wont remember all my
Champagne problems
You wont remember all my
Champagne problems113Embed
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
Oh, my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Loves a game, wanna play? Ayy
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Aint it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So, hey, lets be friends
Im dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
So, its gonna be forever
Or its gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when its over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
Theyll tell you Im insane
Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
Cause were young and were reckless
Well take this way too far
Itll leave you breathless, mm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
Theyll tell you Im insane
But Ive got a blank space, baby
And Ill write your name

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
Youre the king, baby, Im your queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh, no
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing, like
Oh, my God, who is she?
I get drunk on jealousy
But youll come back each time you leave
Cause, darling, Im a nightmare dressed like a daydream
So, its gonna be forever
Or its gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when its over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
Theyll tell you Im insane

Boys only want love if its torture
Dont say I didnt, say I didnt warn ya

Knew her when I was young, reconnected when we were little bit older
Both sprung, I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders
Reputation precedes me, in rumors, Im knee-deep
The truth is, it’s easier to ignore it, believe me
Even when wed argue, wed not do it for long
And you understand the good and bad end up in the song
For all your beautiful traits and the way you do it with ease
For all my flaws, paranoia, and insecurities
Ive made mistakes and made some choices, thats hard to deny
After the storm, something was born on the 4th of July
Ive passed days without fun, this end game is the one
With four words on the tip of my tongue, Ill never say it
I dont wanna touch you (I dont wanna be)
Just another ex-love (You dont wanna see)
I dont wanna miss you (I dont wanna miss you)
Like the other girls do
I dont wanna hurt you (I just wanna be)
Drinking on a beach with (You all over me)
I know what they all say (Yeah)
But I aint tryna play
I wanna be your end game (End game)
I wanna be your first string (Wanna be your first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah
And you heard about me, ooh
I got some big enemies, hey
Big reputation, big reputation, yeah
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah
And I heard about you, ooh
You like the bad ones, too
I hit you like bang, we tried to forget it, but we just couldnt
And I bury hatchets, but I keep maps of where I put em
Reputation precedes me, they told you Im crazy
I swear I dont love the drama, it loves me
And I cant let you go, your handprints on my soul
Its like your eyes are liquor, its like your body is gold
Youve been callin my bluff on all my usual tricks (Ooh)
So heres the truth from my red lips (Ah)
I wanna be your end game (End game)
I wanna be your first string (Me and you; First string)
I wanna be your A-Team (Be your A-Team now; A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game
I wanna be your end game (Oh, I do)
I wanna be your first string (First string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game116Embed
I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
Ive ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, Ill watch as youre leaving
Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)
Its me, hi
Im the problem, its me
At teatime, everybody agrees
Ill stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And Im a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed

Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?
(A tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, Ill watch as youre leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
(For the last time)
Its me, hi
Im the problem, its me (Im the problem, its me)
At teatime, everybody agrees
Ill stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers round and reads it and then someone screams out
Shes laughing up at us from Hell
Its me, hi
Im the problem, its me
Its me, hi
Im the problem, its me
Its me, hi
Everybody agrees, everybody agrees
Its me, hi (Hi)
Im the problem, its me (Im the problem, its me)
At teatime (Teatime), everybody agrees (Everybody agrees)
Ill stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero64Embed
We gather here, we line up, weepin in a sunlit room
And if Im on fire, youll be made of ashes, too
Even on my worst day, did I deserve, babe
All the hell you gave me?
Cause I loved you, I swear I loved you
Til my dying day
I didnt have it in myself to go with grace
And youre the hero flying around, saving face
And if Im dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet
We gather stones, never knowing what theyll mean
Some to throw, some to make a diamond ring
You know I didnt want to have to haunt you
But what a ghostly scene
You wear the same jewels that I gave you
As you bury me
I didnt have it in myself to go with grace
Cause when Id fight, you used to tell me I was brave
And if Im dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet

And I can go anywhere I want
Anywhere I want, just not home
And you can aim for my heart, go for blood
But you would still miss me in your bones
And I still talk to you (When Im screaming at the sky)
And when you cant sleep at night (You hear my stolen lullabies)
I didnt have it in myself to go with grace
And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves
You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
You turned into your worst fears
And youre tossing out blame, drunk on this pain
Crossing out the good years
And youre cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet90Embed
You are somebody that I dont know
But youre takin shots at me like its Patrón
And Im just like, damn, its 7 AM
Say it in the street, thats a knock-out
But you say it in a Tweet, thats a cop-out
And Im just like, Hey, are you okay?
And I aint tryna mess with your self-expression
But Ive learned a lesson that stressin and obsessin bout somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, youre being too loud
And Im just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on my gown?
You need to calm down
You are somebody that we dont know
But youre comin at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD)
Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Makin that sign mustve taken all night

You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
Cause shade never made anybody less gay
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, youre being too loud
And Im just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on his gown?
You need to calm down
And we see you over there on the internet
Comparing all the girls who are killing it
But we figured you out
We all know now we all got crowns
You need to calm down
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down (You need to calm down)
Youre being too loud (Youre being too loud)
And Im just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)

Im like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never wouldve known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
Im begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, thats my man
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize Id cheat to win
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
Im begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, thats my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
Im begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, thats my man

Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a 90s trend
Wait for the signal, and Ill meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open-shut case
I guess I shouldve known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
Im begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, thats my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
Im begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, thats my man
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
Im begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, thats my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
Im begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, thats my man
Hey, thats my man
Thats my man
Yeah, thats my man
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
Thats my man

Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if hes a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holdin him for ransom, some
Some boys are tryin too hard, he dont try at all though
Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta
I, I, I see how this is gon go
Touch me and youll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know Im gonna be with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it?
Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin sorry
But if Im a thief, then he can join the heist, and
Well move to an island, and
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor
Every love Ive known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now, Im so very tame now
Never be the same now, now

I, I, I see how this is gon go
Touch me and youll never be alone

Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, youre right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, youre right, I want it)
Killing me slow, out the window
Im always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesnt kill me makes me want you more
And its new, the shape of your body
Its blue, the feeling Ive got
And its ooh, whoa-oh
Its a cruel summer
Its cool, thats what I tell em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa-oh
Its a cruel summer with you
Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
Im not dying (Oh yeah, youre right, I want it)
We say that well just screw it up in these trying times
Were not trying (Oh yeah, youre right, I want it)

So cut the headlights, summers a knife
Im always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, youll be the last to know, oh
Its new, the shape of your body
Its blue, the feeling Ive got
And its ooh, whoa-oh
Its a cruel summer
Its cool, thats what I tell em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa-oh
Its a cruel summer with you
Im drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby comin home from the bar (Oh)
Said, Im fine, but it wasnt true
I dont wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, For whatever its worth
I love you, aint that the worst thing you ever heard?
He looks up, grinnin like a devil
Its new, the shape of your body
Its blue, the feeling Ive got

Midnight
You come and pick me up, no headlights
A long drive
Could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh
Its been a while since I have even heard from you
(Heard from you)
And I should just tell you to leave
Cause I know exactly where it leads
But I watch us go round and round each time
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
So it goes
He cant keep his wild eyes on the road, mmm
Takes me home
The lights are off, hes taking off his coat, mmm, yeah
I say, I heard, oh
That youve been out and about with some other girl
Some other girl

He says, What you heard is true
But I cant stop thinking bout you and I
I said, Ive been there too a few times
Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt (A tight little skirt)
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time

Green was the color of the grass
Where I used to read at Centennial Park
I used to think I would meet somebody there
Teal was the color of your shirt
When you were sixteen at the yogurt shop
You used to work at to make a little money
Time, curious time
Gave me no compasses, gave me no signs
Were there clues I didnt see?
And isnt it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Bad was the blood of the song in the cab
On your first trip to LA
You ate at my favorite spot for dinner
Bold was the waitress on our three-year trip
Getting lunch down by the Lakes
She said I looked like an American singer

Time, mystical time
Cutting me open, then healing me fine
Were there clues I didnt see?
And isnt it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
A string that pulled me
Out of all the wrong arms, right into that dive bar
Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire
Chains around my demons
Wool to brave the seasons
One single thread of gold
Tied me to you
Cold was the steel of my axe to grind
For the boys who broke my heart
Now I send their babies presents
Gold was the color of the leaves
When I showed you around Centennial Park
Hell was the journey but it brought me heaven
Time, wondrous time
Gave me the blues and then purple-pink skies
And its cool
Baby, with me
And isnt it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

When the morning came
We were cleaning incense off your vinyl shelf
Cause we lost track of time again
Laughing with my feet in your lap
Like you were my closest friend
Howd we end up on the floor, anyway? you say
Your roommates cheap-ass screw-top rosé, thats how
I see you every day now
And I chose you
The one I was dancing with
In New York, no shoes
Looked up at the sky and it was
The burgundy on my t-shirt
When you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
So scarlet, it was
The mark thеy saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew bеtween telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon
When the silence came
We were shaking, blind and hazy
How the hell did we lose sight of us again?
Sobbing with your head in your hands
Aint that the way shit always ends?
You were standing hollow-eyed in the hallway
Carnations you had thought were roses, thats us
I feel you, no matter what
The rubies that I gave up

And I lost you
The one I was dancing with
In New York, no shoes
Looked up at the sky and it was (Maroon)
The burgundy on my t-shirt
When you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
So scarlet, it was (Maroon)
The mark they saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew between telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon
And I wake with your memory over me
Thats a real fucking legacy, legacy (It was maroon)
And I wake with your memory over me
Thats a real fucking legacy to leave
The burgundy on my t-shirt
When you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
So scarlet, it was maroon
The mark they saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew between telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon
It was maroon

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sisters house
And youve still got it in your drawer, even now
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
Were singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know its long gone and
That magics not here no more
And I might be okay, but Im not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh
Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red cause you were lookin over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mothers telling stories bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me bout your past, thinking your future was me

And I know its long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to
Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
Were dancing ‘round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well, yeah
Well, maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
Til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again
Just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
Im a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
Cause I remember it all, all, all
Too well
Time wont fly, its like Im paralyzed by it
Id like to be my old self again, but Im still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now, you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You cant get rid of it
Cause you remember it all too well, yeah
Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing youve ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well146Embed
Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny
Her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off St. Louis
Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money
And the town said, How did a middle-class divorcée do it?
The wedding was charming, if a little gauche
Theres only so far new money goes
They picked out a home and called it Holiday House
Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud
The doctor had told him to settle down
It must have been her fault his heart gave out
And they said
There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what couldve been
There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything
Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever
Flew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city
Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names
And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet
And losing on card game bets with Dalí

And they said
There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what couldve been
There goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything
They say she was seen on occasion
Pacing the rocks, staring out at the midnight sea
And in a feud with her neighbor
She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green
Fifty years is a long time
Holiday House sat quietly on that beach
Free of women with madness, their men and bad habits
And then it was bought by me
Who knows, if I never showed up, what couldve been
There goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen
I had a marvelous time ruining everything
I had a marvelous time ruining everything
A marvelous time ruining everything
A marvelous time
I had a marvelous time71Embed
Please picture me in the trees
I hit my peak at seven
Feet in the swing over the creek
I was too scared to jump in
But I, I was high in the sky
With Pennsylvania under me
Are there still beautiful things?
Sweet tea in the summer
Cross your heart, wont tell no other
And though I can’t recall your face
I still got love for you
Your braids like a pattern
Love you to the Moon and to Saturn
Passed down like folk songs
The love lasts so long
And Ive been meaning to tell you
I think your house is haunted
Your dad is always mad and that must be why
And I think you should come live with me
And we can be pirates
Then you wont have to cry
Or hide in the closet
And just like a folk song
Our love will be passed on

Please picture me in the weeds
Before I learned civility
I used to scream ferociously
Any time I wanted
I, I
Sweet tea in the summer
Cross my heart, won’t tell no other
And though I cant recall your face
I still got love for you
Pack your dolls and a sweater
Well move to India forever
Passed down like folk songs
Our love lasts so long85Embed
Ive been having a hard time adjusting
I had the shiniest wheels, now theyre rusting
I didnt know if youd care if I came back
I have a lot of regrets about that
Pulled the car off the road to the lookout
Couldve followed my fears all the way down
And maybe I dont quite know what to say
But Im here in your doorway
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
They told me all of my cages were mental
So I got wasted like all my potential
And my words shoot to kill when Im mad
I have a lot of regrets about that
I was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere
Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here
Pouring out my heart to a stranger
But I didnt pour the whiskey
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying

At least Im trying
And its hard to be at a party when I feel like an open wound
Its hard to be anywhere these days when all I want is you
Youre a flashback in a film reel on the one screen in my town
And I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
(And maybe I dont quite know what to say)
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
At least Im trying78Embed
Honey, when Im above the trees
I see this for what it is
But now Im right down in it, all the years Ive given
Is just shit were dividin up
Showed you all of my hiding spots
I was dancing when the music stopped
And in the disbelief, I cant face reinvention
I havent met the new me yet
Therell be happiness after you
But there was happiness because of you
Both of these things can be true
There is happiness
Past the blood and bruise
Past the curses and cries
Beyond the terror in the nightfall
Haunted by the look in my eyes
That wouldve loved you for a lifetime
Leave it all behind
And there is happiness
Tell me, when did your winning smile
Begin to look like a smirk?
When did all our lessons start to look like weapons
Pointed at my deepest hurt?
I hope shell be a beautiful fool
Who takes my spot next to you
No, I didnt mean that
Sorry, I cant see facts through all of my fury
You havent met the new me yet

Therell be happiness after me
But there was happiness because of me
Both of these things, I believe
There is happiness
In our history, across our great divide
There is a glorious sunrise
Dappled with the flickers of light
From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind
And there is happiness
I cant make it go away by making you a villain
I guess its the price I paid for seven years in Heaven
And I pulled your body into mine
Every goddamn night, now I get fake niceties
No one teaches you what to do
When a good man hurts you
And you know you hurt him too
Honey, when Im above the trees
I see it for what it is
But now my eyes leak acid rain on the pillow where you used to lay your head
After giving you the best I had
Tell me what to give after that
All you want from me now is the green light of forgiveness
You havent met the new me yet
And I think shell give you that
Therell be happiness after you
But there was happiness because of you too
Both of these things can be true
There is happiness
In our history, across our great divide
There is a glorious sunrise
Dappled with the flickers of light
From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind
Oh, leave it all behind
Leave it all behind
And there is happiness49Embed
Summer went away, still, the yearning stays
I play it cool with the best of them
I wait patiently, hes gonna notice me
Its okay, were the best of friends
Anyway
I hear it in your voice, youre smoking with your boys
I touch my phone as if its your face
I didnt choose this town, I dream of getting out
Theres just one who could make me stay
All my days
From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I waited ages to see you there
I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that you never cared
Youre on your own, kid
You always have been
I see the great escape, so long, Daisy May
I picked the petals, he loves me not
Something different bloomed, writing in my room
I play my songs in the parking lot
Ill run away

From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I called a taxi to take me there
I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that my dreams arent rare
Youre on your own, kid
You always have been

From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I gave my blood, sweat, and tears for this
I hosted parties and starved my body
Like Id be saved by a perfect kiss
The jokes werent funny, I took the money
My friends from home dont know what to say
I looked around in a blood-soaked gown
And I saw something they cant take away
Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned
Everything you lose is a step you take
So, make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it
Youve got no reason to be afraid
Youre on your own, kid
Yeah, you can face this
Youre on your own, kid
You always have been40Embed
My castle crumbled overnight
I brought a knife to a gunfight
They took the crown, but its alright
All the liars are calling me one
Nobodys heard from me for months
Im doin better than I ever was
Cause
My babys fit like a daydream
Walkin with his head down
Im the one hes walking to
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My babys fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like Im brand new
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
All my flowers grew back as thorns
Windows boarded up after the storm
He built a fire just to keep me warm
All the drama queens taking swings
All the jokers dressing up as kings
They fade to nothing when I look at him
And I know I make the same mistakes every time
Bridges burn, I never learn
At least I did one thing right
I did one thing right
Im laughing with my lover, makin forts under covers
Trust him like a brother
Yeah, you know I did one thing right
Starry eyes sparkin up my darkest night

My babys fit like a daydream
Walkin with his head down
Im the one hes walking to
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My babys fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like Im brand new
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
I want to wear his initial on a chain round my neck
Chain round my neck
Not because he owns me
But cause he really knows me
Which is more than they can say, I
I recall late November
Holding my breath, slowly, I said
You dont need to save me
But would you run away with me?
Yes (Would you run away?)
My babys fit like a daydream
Walkin with his head down
Im the one hes walking to
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
So call it what you want, yeah (Call it what you want it to)

This aint for the best
My reputations never been worse, so
You must like me for me
We cant make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink
Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Come here, you can meet me in the back
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you
Oh, damn, never seen that color blue
Just think of the fun things we could do
(Cause I like you) This aint for the best
My reputations never been worse, so
You must like me for me

Third floor on the West Side, me and you
Handsome, youre a mansion with a view
Do the girls back home touch you like I do?
Long night with your hands up in my hair
Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs
Stay here, honey, I dont wanna share
(Cause I like you) This aint for the best
My reputations never been worse, so
You must like me for me

Make sure nobody sees you leave
Hood over your head, keep your eyes down
Tell your friends youre out for a run
You’ll be flushed when you return
Take the road less traveled by
Tell yourself you can always stop
What started in beautiful rooms
Ends with meetings in parking lots
And thats the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and longing stares
Its born from just one single glance
But it dies and it dies and it dies
A million little times
Leave the perfume on the shelf
That you picked out just for him
So you leave no trace behind
Like you don’t even exist
Take the words for what they are
A dwindling, mercurial high
A drug that only worked
The first few hundred times

And thats the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and stolen stares
They show their truth one single time
But they lie and they lie and they lie
A million little times
And you wanna scream
Dont call me kid, dont call me baby
Look at this godforsaken mess that you made me
You showed me colors you know I cant see with anyone else
Dont call me kid, dont call me baby
Look at this idiotic fool that you made me
You taught me a secret language I cant speak with anyone else
And you know damn well
For you, I would ruin myself
A million little times89Embed
I sit and watch you reading with your head low
I wake and watch you breathing with your eyes closed
I sit and watch you
I notice everything you do or dont do
Youre so much older and wiser, and I
I wait by the door like Im just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it
If its all in my head, tell me now
Tell me Ive got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it
I greet you with a battle heros welcome
I take your indiscretions all in good fun
I sit and listеn, I polish plates until they gleam and glistеn
Youre so much older and wiser and I
I wait by the door like Im just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it
If its all in my head, tell me now
Tell me Ive got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it

While you were out building other worlds, where was I?
Wheres that man whod throw blankets over my barbed wire?
I made you my temple, my mural, my sky
Now Im begging for footnotes in the story of your life
Drawing hearts in the byline
Always taking up too much space or time
You assume Im fine, but what would you do if I
Break free and leave us in ruins
Took this dagger in me and removed it
Gain the weight of you, then lose it
Believe me, I could do it
If its all in my head, tell me now
Tell me Ive got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it
I sit and watch you81Embed
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
Im standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, Hello
Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, Stay away from Juliet
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, Please, dont go, and I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
Ill be waiting, all theres left to do is run
Youll be the prince and Ill be the princess
Its a love story, baby, just say Yes
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, cause were dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, Stay away from Juliet
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, Please, dont go, and I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
Ill be waiting, all theres left to do is run
Youll be the prince and Ill be the princess
Its a love story, baby, just say Yes
Romeo, save me, theyre trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but its real
Dont be afraid, well make it out of this mess
Its a love story, baby, just say Yes
Oh, oh
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town
And I said, Romeo, save me, Ive been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I dont know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
Marry me, Juliet, youll never have to be alone
I love you, and thats all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
Its a love story, baby, just say Yes
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Cause we were both young when I first saw you178Embed
I remember
Good girl, sad boy
Big city, wrong choices
We had one thing goin on
I swear that it was somethin
Cause I dont remember who I was
Before you painted all my nights
A color Ive searched for since
But one thing after another
Fuckin situations, circumstances
Miscommunications, and I
Have to say, by the way
I just may like some explanations
Can I ask you a question?
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room
And every single one of your friends was makin fun of you
But fifteen seconds later, thеy were clappin too?
Then what did you do?
Did you lеave her house in the middle of the night? Oh
Did you wish youd put up more of a fight, oh
When she said it was too much?
Do you wish you could still touch her?
Its just a question

Half-moon eyes, bad surprise
Did you realize out of time?
She was on your mind with some dickhead guy
That you saw that night
But you were on somethin
It was one drink after another
Fuckin politics and gender roles
And youre not sure and I dont know
Got swept away in the gray
I just may like to have a conversation
Can I ask you a question?
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room
And every single one of your friends was makin fun of you
But fifteen seconds later, they were clappin too?
Then what did you do?
Did you leave her house in the middle of the night? Oh
Did you wish youd put up more of a fight, oh
When she said it was too much?
Do you wish you could still touch her?
Its just a question
Does it feel like everythings just like
Second best after that meteor strike?
And whats that that I heard? That youre still with her?
Thats nice, Im sure thats whats suitable
And right, but tonight
Can I ask you a question? (Can I ask you a question?)
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room (In a crowded room)
And every single one of your friends was makin fun of you (Makin fun of you)

One night, a few moons ago
I saw flecks of what couldve been lights
But it might just have been you
Passing by unbeknownst to me
Life is emotionally abusive
And time cant stop me quite like you did
And my flight was awful, thanks for asking
Im unglued, thanks to you
And its like snow at the beach
Weird, but fuckin beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me
Tonight feels impossible
But its comin down
No sound, its all around
Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow, ah

This scene feels like what I once saw on a screen
I searched aurora borealis green
Ive never seen someone lit from within
Blurring out my periphery
My smile is like I won a contest
And to hide that would be so dishonest
And its fine to fake it til you make it
Til you do, til its true
Now its like snow at the beach
Weird, but fuckin beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me
Tonight feels impossible
But its comin down
No sound, its all around
Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow, ah
I (I) cant (Cant) speak, afraid to jinx it
I (I) dont (Dont) even dare to wish it
But your eyes are flying saucers from another planet
Now Im all for you like Janet
Can this be a real thing? Can it?
Are we falling like snow at the beach? (Snow at the beach)
Weird, but fuckin beautiful
Flying in a dream (Flying in a dream)
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me (You wanting me)
Tonight feels impossible
But its comin down
No sound, its all around
Like snow on the beach (Snow on the beach)

Hows one to know?
Id meet you where the spirit meets the bones
In a faith-forgotten land
In from the snow
Your touch brought forth an incandescent glow
Tarnished but so grand
And the old widow goes to the stone every day
But I dont, I just sit here and wait
Grieving for the living
Oh, goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine, but its been promised to another
Oh, I cant
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now Im covered in you
I wish to know
The fatal flaw that makes you long to be
Magnificently cursed
Hes in the room
Your opal eyes are all I wish to see
He wants whats only yours

Oh, goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine, but its been promised to another
Oh, I cant
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now Im covered
Clover blooms in the fields
Spring breaks loose, the time is near
What would he do if he found us out?
Crescent moon, coast is clear
Spring breaks loose, but so does fear
Hes gonna burn this house to the ground
Hows one to know?
Id live and die for moments that we stole
On begged and borrowed time
So tell me to run
Or dare to sit and watch what well become
And drink my husbands wine
Oh, goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine, but its been promised to another
Oh, I cant
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now Im covered in you
And Im covered in you
So yeah, its a fire
Its a goddamn blaze in the dark
And you started it
You started it
So yeah, its a war
Its the goddamn fight of my life
And you started it
You started it
Oh, I cant
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now Im covered
In you, in you
Now Im covered in you

Follow procedure, remember? Oh, wait, you got amnesia
It was my season for battle wounds
Battle scars, body bumped, bruised
Stabbed in the back; brimstone, fire jumping through
Still, all my life, I got money and power

I want you to know
Im a mirrorball
Ill show you every version of yourself tonight
Ill get you out on the floor
Shimmering beautiful
And when I break, its in a million pieces
Hush, when no one is around, my dear
Youll find me on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you
Hush, I know they said the end is near
But Im still on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you
I want you to know
Im a mirrorball
I can change everything about me to fit in
You are not like the regulars
The masquerade revelers
Drunk as they watch my shattered edges glisten

Hush, when no one is around, my dear
Youll find me on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you
Hush, I know they said the end is near
But Im still on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you
And they called off the circus, burned the disco down
When they sent home the horses and the rodeo clowns
Im still on that tightrope
Im still trying everything to get you laughing at me
And Im still a believer, but I dont know why
Ive never been a natural, all I do is try, try, try
Im still on that trapeze
Im still trying everything to keep you looking at me
Because Im a mirrorball
Im a mirrorball
And Ill show you every version of yourself tonight63Embed
Gray November
Ive been down since July
Motion capture
Put me in a bad light
I replay my footsteps on each stepping stone
Trying to find the one where I went wrong
Writing letters
Addressed to the fire
And I was catching my breath
Staring out an open window
Catching my death
And I couldnt be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for
Evermore
Hey December
Guess Im feeling unmoored
Cant remember
What I used to fight for
I rewind thе tape, but all it does is pause
On thе very moment all was lost
Sending signals
To be double-crossed

And I was catching my breath
Barefoot in the wildest winter
Catching my death
And I couldnt be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for
Evermore
(Evermore)
Cant not think of all the cost
And the things that will be lost
Oh, can we just get a pause?
To be certain, well be tall again
Whether weather be the frost
Or the violence of the dog days
Im on waves, out being tossed
Is there a line that I could just go cross?
And when I was shipwrecked (Cant think of all the cost now)
I thought of you (All the things that will be lost now)
In the cracks of light (Can we just get a pause?)
I dreamed of you (To be certain well be tall again)
(If you think of all the costs)
It was real enough (Whether weather be the frost)
To get me through (Or the violence of the dog days)
(Or the violence of the dog days)
(Out on waves, being tossed)
(Im on waves, out being tossed)
But I swear (Is there a line that we can just go cross?)
You were there
And I was catching my breath
Floors of a cabin creaking under my step
And I couldnt be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
This pain wouldnt be for
Evermore
Evermore
Evermore
This pain wouldnt be for evermore

If you wouldve blinked, then I wouldve
Looked away at the first glance
If you tasted poison, you couldve
Spit me out at the first chance
And if I was some paint, did it splatter
On a promising grown man?
And if I was a child, did it matter
If you got to wash your hands?
Ooh, all I used to do was pray
Wouldve, couldve, shouldve
If youd never looked my way
I wouldve stayed on my knees
And I damn sure never wouldve danced with the devil
At nineteen
And the Gods honest truth is that the pain was heaven
And now that Im grown, Im scared of ghosts
Memories feel like weapons
And now that I know, I wish youd left me wondering
If you never touched me, I wouldve
Gone along with the righteous
If I never blushed, then they couldve
Never whispered about this
And if you never saved me from boredom
I couldve gone on as I was
But, Lord, you made me feel important
And then you tried to erase us

Ooh, youre a crisis of my faith
Wouldve, couldve, shouldve
If Id only played it safe
I wouldve stayed on my knees
And I damn sure never wouldve danced with the devil
At nineteen
And the Gods honest truth is that the pain was heaven
And now that Im grown, Im scared of ghosts
Memories feel like weapons
And now that I know, I wish youd left me wondering
God rest my soul
I miss who I used to be
The tomb wont close
Stained glass windows in my mind
I regret you all the time
I cant let this go
I fight with you in my sleep
The wound wont close
I keep on waiting for a sign
I regret you all the time
If claritys in death, then why wont this die?
Years of tearing down our banners, you and I
Living for the thrill of hitting you where it hurts
Give me back my girlhood, it was mine first
And I damn sure never wouldve danced with the devil
At nineteen
And the Gods honest truth is that the pain was heaven
And now that Im grown, Im scared of ghosts
Memories feel like weapons
And now that I know, I wish youd left me wondering
God rest my soul
I miss who I used to be
The tomb wont close
Stained glass windows in my mind
I regret you all the time
I cant let this go
I fight with you in my sleep
The wound wont close
I keep on waiting for a sign
I regret you all the time
Oh, God rest my soul
I miss who I used to be
The tomb wont close
Stained glass windows in my mind
I regret you all the time
I cant let this go

Our coming-of-age has come and gone
Suddenly this summer, its clear
I never had the courage of my convictions
As long as danger is near
And its just around the corner, darlin
Cause it lives in me
No, I could never give you peace
But Im a fire and Ill keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade, ocean wave blues come
All these people think loves for show
But I would die for you in secret
The devils in the details, but you got a friend in me
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
Your integrity makes me seem small
You paint dreamscapes on the wall
I talk shit with my friends, its like Im wasting your honor
And you know that Id swing with you for the fences
Sit with you in the trenches
Give you my wild, give you a child
Give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other
Family that I chose, now that I see your brother as my brother
Is it enough?
But theres robbers to the east, clowns to the west
Id give you my sunshine, give you my best
But the rain is always gonna come if youre standin with me

But Im a fire and Ill keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade, ocean wave blues come
All these people think loves for show
But I would die for you in secret
The devils in the details, but you got a friend in me
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?

Gorgeous
You should take it as a compliment
That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
You should think about the consequence
Of your magnetic field being a little too strong
And I got a boyfriend, hes older than us
Hes in the club doin I dont know what
Youre so cool, it makes me hate you so much (I hate you so much)
Whisky on ice, Sunset and Vine
Youve ruined my life by not being mine
Youre so gorgeous
I cant say anything to your face
Cause look at your face (Gorgeous)
And Im so furious
At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say?
Youre gorgeous
You should take it as a compliment
That Im talking to everyone here but you (But you, but you)
And you should think about the consequence
Of you touching my hand in a darkened room (Dark room, dark room)
If youve got a girlfriend, Im jealous of her
But if youre single thats honestly worse
Cause youre so gorgeous it actually hurts (Honey, it hurts)

Ocean blue eyes looking in mine
I feel like I might sink and drown and die
Youre so gorgeous
I cant say anything to your face (To your face)
Cause look at your face (Look at your face, gorgeous)
And Im so furious
At you for making me feel this way (Feel this way)
But what can I say?
Youre gorgeous
You make me so happy it turns back to sad
Theres nothing I hate more than what I cant have
And you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad (Mmh)
You make me so happy it turns back to sad (Yeah)
Theres nothing I hate more than what I cant have and
Guess Ill just stumble on home to my cats (Yeugh) alone
Unless, you wanna come along? (Oh)
Youre so gorgeous
I cant say anything to your face (To your face)
Cause look at your face (Look at your face, gorgeous)
And Im so furious (Im so furious)
At you for making me feel this way (Feel this way)

Youre talking shit for the hell of it
Addicted to betrayal, but youre relevant
Youre terrified to look down
Cause if you dare, youll see the glare
Of everyone you burned just to get there
Its coming back around
And I keep my side of the street clean
You wouldnt know what I mean
Cause karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karmas a relaxing thought
Arent you envious that for you its not?
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
Purring in my lap cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that
Spiderboy, king of thieves
Weave your little webs of opacity
My pennies made your crown
Trick me once, trick me twice
Dont you know that cash aint the only price?
Its coming back around

And I keep my side of the street clean
You wouldnt know what I mean
Cause karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karmas a relaxing thought
Arent you envious that for you its not?
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
Purring in my lap cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that
Ask me what I learned from all those years
Ask me what I earned from all those tears
Ask me why so many fade, but Im still here
(Im still here, Im still here)
Cause karma is the thunder
Rattling your ground
Karmas on your scent like a bounty hunter
Karmas gonna track you down
Step by step, from town to town
Sweet like justice, karma is a queen
Karma takes all my friends to the summit
Karma is the guy on the screen
Coming straight home to me
Cause karma is my boyfriend (Karma is my boyfriend)
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend (Weekend)
Karmas a relaxing thought
Arent you envious that for you its not?
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
Purring in my lap cause it loves me

Gleaming, twinkling
Eyes like sinking ships on waters
So inviting, I almost jump in
But I dont like a gold rush, gold rush
I dont like anticipatin my face in a red flush
I dont like that anyone would die to feel your touch
Everybody wants you
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
Walk past, quick brush
I dont like slow motion, double vision in rose blush
I dont like that falling feels like flying til the bone crush
Everybody wants you
But I dont like a gold rush
What must it be like to grow up that beautiful?
With your hair falling into place like dominoes
I see me padding across your wooden floors
With my Eagles T-shirt hanging from the door
At dinner parties, I call you out on your contrarian shit
And the coastal town we wandered round had nеver seen a love as pure as it
And thеn it fades into the gray of my day-old tea
Cause it could never be

Cause I dont like a gold rush, gold rush
I dont like anticipatin my face in a red flush
I dont like that anyone would die to feel your touch
Everybody wants you
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
Walk past, quick brush
I dont like slow motion, double vision in rose blush
I dont like that falling feels like flying til the bone crush
Everybody wants you
But I dont like a gold rush
What must it be like to grow up that beautiful?
With your hair falling into place like dominoes
My mind turns your life into folklore
I cant dare to dream about you anymore
At dinner parties, I wont call you out on your contrarian shit
And the coastal town we never found will never see a love as pure as it
Cause it fades into the gray of my day-old tea
Cause it will never be
Gleaming, twinkling
Eyes like sinking ships on waters
So inviting, I almost jump in52Embed
Draw the cat eye sharp enough to kill a man
You did some bad things, but Im the worst of them
Sometimes I wonder which onell be your last lie
They say looks can kill and I might try
I dont dress for women
I dont dress for men
Lately, Ive been dressin for revenge
I dont start shit, but I can tell you how it ends
Dont get sad, get even
So on the weekends
I dont dress for friends
Lately, Ive been dressin for revenge
She needed cold, hard proof, so I gave her some
She had the envelope, where you think she got it from?
Now she gets the house, gets the kids, gets the pride
Picture me thick as thieves with your ex-wife
And she looks so pretty
Drivin in your Benz
Lately, shes been dressin for revenge
She dont start shit, but she can tell you how it ends
Dont get sad, get even
So on the weekends
She dont dress for friends
Lately, shes been dressing for revenge

Ladies always rise above
Ladies know what people want
Someone sweet and kind and fun
The lady simply had enough
While he was doin lines and crossin all of mine
Someone told his white-collar crimes to the FBI
And I dont dress for villains
Or for innocents
Im on my vigilante shit again
I dont start shit, but I can tell you how it ends
Dont get sad, get even
So on the weekends
I dont dress for friends
Lately, Ive been dressin for revenge31Embed
What did you think Id say to that?
Does a scorpion sting when fighting back?
They strike to kill, and you know I will
You know I will
What do you sing on your drive home?
Do you see my face in the neighbors lawn?
Does she smile?
Or does she mouth, Fuck you forever?
Every time you call me crazy, I get more crazy
What about that?
And when you say I seem angry, I get more angry
And theres nothing like a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
No one likes a mad woman
You made her like that
And youll poke that bear til her claws come out
And you find something to wrap your noose around
And theres nothing like a mad woman
Now I breathe flames each time I talk
My cannons all firin at your yacht
They say move on, but you know I wont
And women like hunting witches too
Doing your dirtiest work for you
Its obvious that wanting me dead
Has really brought you two together

Every time you call me crazy, I get more crazy
What about that?
And when you say I seem angry, I get more angry
And theres nothing like a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
No one likes a mad woman
You made her like that
And youll poke that bear til her claws come out
And you find something to wrap your noose around
And theres nothing like a mad woman
Im taking my time, taking my time
Cause you took everything from me
Watching you climb, watching you climb
Over people like me
The master of spin has a couple side flings
Good wives always know
She should be mad, should be scathing like me, but
No one likes a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
You made her like that44Embed
Dont blame me, love made me crazy

Ive been breakin hearts a long time
And toyin with them older guys
Just playthings for me to use
Something happened for the first time
In the darkest little paradise
Shaking, pacin, I just need you
For you, I would cross the line
I would waste my time
I would lose my mind

Echoes (Echoes) of your name inside my mind
Halo hiding my obsession
I once was poison ivy, but now Im your daisy
And, baby, for you
I would (I would) fall from grace
Just to (Just to) touch your face
If you (If you) walk away, Id beg you on my knees to stay
Dont blame me, love made me crazy

Rain
He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight
My town was a wasteland
Full of cages, full of fences
Pageant queens and big pretenders
But for some, it was paradise
My boy was a montage
A slow-motion, love potion
Jumping off things in the ocean
I broke his heart cause he was nice
He was sunshine, I was midnight rain
He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight
It came like a postcard
Picture perfect shiny family
Holiday peppermint candy
But for him, its every day
So I peered through a window
A deep portal, time travel
All the love we unravel
And the life I gave away
Cause he was sunshine, I was midnight rain

He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight rain
He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight
I guess sometimes we all get
Just what we wanted, just what we wanted
And he never thinks of me
Except for when Im on TV
I guess sometimes we all get
Some kind of haunted, some kind of haunted
And I never think of him
Except on midnights like this
(Midnights like this, midnights like this)29Embed
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car
It was the best of times, the worst of crimes
I struck a match and blew your mind
But I didnt mean it and you didn’t see it
The ties were black, the lies were white
In shades of gray in candlelight
I wanted to leave him, I needed a reason
X marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, I was lyin to myself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
We never had a shotgun shot in the dark (Oh!)
You were drivin the getaway car
We were flyin’, but wed never get far
Dont pretend its such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Shouldve known Id be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ah
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

It was the great escape, the prison break
The light of freedom on my face
But you werent thinkin’ and I was just drinkin’
While he was runnin after us, I was screamin’, Go, go, go!
But with three of us, honey, its a sideshow
And a circus aint a love story and now were both sorry
(We’re both sorry)
X marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, every man for himself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
It hit you like a shotgun shot to the heart (Oh!)
You were drivin the getaway car
We were flyin, but wed never get far
Dont pretend its such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Shouldve known Id be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ah
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car
We were jet-set, Bonnie and Clyde (Oh-oh)
Until I switched to the other side, to the other side
Its no surprise I turned you in (Oh-oh)
Cause us traitors never win
Im in a getaway car
I left you in a motel bar
Put the money in a bag and I stole the keys
That was the last time you ever saw me (Oh!)
Drivin the getaway car
We were flyin, but wed never get far (Dont pretend)
Dont pretend its such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart (Shouldve known)
Shouldve known Id be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ah
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car
I was ridin in a getaway car
I was cryin in a getaway car
I was dyin in a getaway car
Said goodbye in a getaway car

I would be complex, I would be cool
Theyd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to
And that would be okay for me to do
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you
I’d be a fearless leader, Id be an alpha type
When everyone believes ya, whats that like?
I’m so sick of running as fast as I can
Wonderin if Id get there quicker if I was a man
And Im so sick of them comin at me again
Cause if I was a man, then Id be the man
Id be the man (Man)
I’d be the man (Man)
They’d say I hustled, put in the work
They wouldnt shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve
What I was wearing, if I was rude
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves
And they would toast to me, oh (Ayy), let the players play
I’d be just like Leo in Saint-Tropez

Im so sick of running as fast as I can
Wonderin if Id get there quicker if I was a man
And I’m so sick of them comin at me again
Cause if I was a man, then Id be the man
Id be the man (Man)
Id be the man (Man)
Whats it like to brag about raking in dollars
And getting bitches and models?
And its all good if youre bad
And its okay if youre mad
If I was out flashin my dollars
Id be a bitch, not a baller
Theyd paint me out to be bad
So its okay that Im mad
Im so sick of running as fast as I can
Wonderin if Id get there quicker if I was a man (You know that)
And Im so sick of them comin at me again (Comin at me again)
Cause if I was a man (If I was a man), then Id be the man (Then Id be the man)
Im so sick of running as fast as I can (As fast as I can)
Wonderin if Id get there quicker if I was a man (Hey)
And Im so sick of them comin at me again (Comin at me again)

My only one
My smoking gun
My eclipsed sun
This has broken me down
My twisted knife
My sleepless night
My winless fight
This has frozen my ground
Stood on the cliffside screaming, Give me a reason
Your faithless loves the only hoax I believe in
Dont want no other shade of blue but you
No other sadness in the world would do
My best laid plan
Your sleight of hand
My barren land
I am ash from your fire
Stood on the cliffside screaming, Give me a reason
Your faithless loves the only hoax I believe in
Dont want no other shade of blue but you
No other sadness in the world would do

You know I left a part of me back in New York
You knew the hero died so whats the movie for?
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart
You knew the password so I let you in the door
You knew you won so whats the point of keeping score?
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart
But what you did was just as dark
(Ah, ah, ah)
Darling, this was just as hard
As when they pulled me apart
My only one
My kingdom come undone
My broken drum
You have beaten my heart
Dont want no other shade of blue but you
No other sadness in the world would do57Embed
Our secret moments in a crowded room
They got no idea about me and you
There is an indentation in the shape of you
Made your mark on me, a golden tattoo
All of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation
My hands are shaking from holding back from you
Ha, ah, ah
All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from all this
Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah
Say my name and everything just stops
I dont want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off, ha, ha, ha-ah
Carve your name into my bedpost
’Cause I dont want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off, ha, ha, ha-ah
Inescapable, Im not even gonna try
And if I get burned, at least we were electrified
I’m spilling wine in the bathtub
You kiss my face and were both drunk
Everyone thinks that they know us
But they know nothin about

All of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation
My hands are shaking from holding back from you
Ha, ah, ah
All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from all this
Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah
Say my name and everything just stops
I dont want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off, ha, ha, ha-ah
Carve your name into my bedpost

Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off, ha, ha

Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah-ah
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Flashback when you met me, your buzzcut and my hair bleached
Even in my worst times, you could see the best in me
Flashback to my mistakes, my rebounds, my earthquakes
Even in my worst lies, you saw the truth in me
And I woke up just in time, now I wake up by your side
My one and only, my lifeline
I woke up just in time, now I wake up by your side
My hands shake, I cant explain this
Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah
Say my name and everything just stops
I dont want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off, ha, ha, ha-ah
Carve your name into my bedpost
’Cause I don’t want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off

He did it

Estes a friend of mine
We meet up every Tuesday night for dinner and a glass of wine
Estes been losin sleep
Her husbands actin different, and it smells like infidelity
She says, That aint my Merlot on his mouth
That aint my jewelry on our joint account
No, there aint no doubt
I think Im gonna call him out
She says, I think he did it, but I just cant prove it
I think he did it, but I just cant prove it

No, no body, no crime
But I aint lettin up until the day I die
No, no

No, no

Este wasnt there Tuesday night at Olive Gardеn
At her job or anywhere
Hе reports his missing wife
And I noticed when I passed his house
His truck has got some brand new tires
And his mistress moved in
Sleeps in Estes bed and everything
No, there aint no doubt
Somebodys gotta catch him out, cause
I think he did it, but I just cant prove it (He did it)
I think he did it, but I just cant prove it (He did it)

Good thing my daddy made me get a boating license when I was fifteen
And Ive cleaned enough houses to know how to cover up a scene
Good thing Estes sisters gonna swear she was with me
(She was with me, dude)
Good thing his mistress took out a big life insurance policy
They think she did it, but they just cant prove it
They think she did it, but they just cant prove it
She thinks I did it, but she just cant prove it
No, no body, no crime
I wasnt lettin up until the day he—

I never trust a narcissist, but they love me

And I make it look, oh, so easy
Cause for every lie I tell them, they tell me three
This is how the world works
Now all he thinks about is me
I can feel the flames on my skin
Crimson red paint on my lips
If a man talks shit, then I owe him nothing
I dont regret it one bit cause he had it coming
They say I did something bad

But if he drops my name, then I owe him nothin

Combat, Im ready for combat
I say I dont want that, but what if I do?
Cause cruelty wins in the movies
Ive got a hundred thrown-out speeches I almost said to you
Easy they come, easy they go
I jump from the train, I ride off alone
I never grew up, its getting so old
Help me hold on to you
Ive been the archer, Ive been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?
Dark side, I search for your dark side
But what if Im alright, right, right, right here?
And I cut off my nose just to spite my face
Then I hate my reflection for years and years
I wake in the night, I pace like a ghost
The room is on fire, invisible smoke
And all of my heroes die all alone
Help me hold on to you

Ive been the archer, Ive been the prey
Screaming, who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?
(I see right through me, I see right through me)
Cause they see right through me
They see right through me
They see right through
Can you see right through me?
They see right through
They see right through me
I see right through me
I see right through me
All the kings horses, all the kings men
Couldnt put me together again
Cause all of my enemies started out friends
Help me hold on to you
Ive been the archer, Ive been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?

Who could stay?

He said, Lets get out of this town
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds
I thought, Heaven cant help me now
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down
Hes so tall and handsome as hell
Hes so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is
Say youll remember me
Standin in a nice dress
Starin at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say youll see me again
Even if its just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
I said, No one has to know what we do
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothin lasts forever
But this is gettin good now

Hes so tall and handsome as hell
Hes so bad, but he does it so well
And when weve had our very last kiss
My last request is
Say youll remember me
Standin in a nice dress
Starin at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say youll see me again
Even if its just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
Youll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burnin it down
Someday, when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around
Youll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burnin (Burnin) it (It) down (Down)
Someday, when you leave me

Starin at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks

Wildest dreams, ah, ha (Ah)
In your wildest dreams, ah, ha
Even if its just in your

I washed my hands of us at the club
You made a mess of me
I pictured you with other girls in love
Then threw up on the street
Like waiting for a bus that never shows
You just start walkin on
They say that if its right, you know
Each bar plays our song
Nothing has ever felt so wrong
Oh, my, love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by
It hits different
It hits different this time
Catastrophic blues
Movin on was always easy for me to do
It hits different
It hits different cause its you
(Cause its you)
I used to switch out these Kens, Id just ghost
Rip the band-aid off and skip town likе an asshole outlaw
Freedom felt like summеr then on the coast
Now the sun burns my heart and the sand hurts my feelings
And I never dont cry (And I never dont cry) at the bar
Yeah, my sadness is contagious (My sadness is contagious)
I slur your name til someone puts me in a car
I stopped receiving invitations

Oh, my, love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by
It hits different
It hits different this time
Catastrophic blues
Movin on was always easy for me to do
It hits different
It hits different cause its you
(Cause its you)
I find the artifacts, cried over a hat
Cursed the space that I needed
I trace the evidence, make it make some sense
Why the wound is still bleedin
You were the one that I loved
Dont need another metaphor, its simple enough
A wrinkle in time like the crease by your eyes
This is why they shouldnt kill off the main guy
Dreams of your hair and your stare and sense of belief
In the good in the world, you once believed in me
And I felt you and I held you for a while
Bet I could still melt your world
Argumentative, antithetical dream girl
I heard your key turn in the door down the hallway
Is that your key in the door?
Is it okay? Is it you?
Or have they come to take me away?
To take me away
Oh, my, love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by
It hits different (It hits different)
It hits different this time
Catastrophic blues
Movin on was always easy for me to do
It hits different (It hits different)
It hits different cause its you
Oh, my, love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by
Cause its you
Catastrophic blues
Movin on was always easy for me to do
It hits different (Yeah)
It hits different cause its you19Embed
Keep your helmet, keep your life, son
Just a flesh wound, heres your rifle
Crawling up the beaches now
Sir, I think hes bleeding out
And some things you just cant speak about
With you I serve, with you I fall down, down
Watch you breathe in, watch you breathing out, out
Something med school did not cover
Someones daughter, someones mother
Holds your hand through plastic now
Doc, I think shes crashing out
And some things you just cant speak about
Only twenty minutes to sleep
But you dream of some epiphany
Just one single glimpse of relief
To make some sense of what youve seen
With you I serve, with you I fall down, down (Down)
Watch you breathe in, watch you breathing out, out
With you I serve (With you I serve), with you I fall down (Down), down (Down)
Watch you breathe in (Watch you breathe in), watch you breathing out (Out), out (Out)

Only twenty minutes to sleep

Meet me at midnight
Staring at the ceiling with you

And you dont really read into
My melancholia
I been under scrutiny (Yeah, oh, yeah)
You handle it beautifully (Yeah, oh, yeah)
All this shit is new to me (Yeah, oh, yeah)
I feel
The lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal
Im damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal
The 1950s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze
All they keep asking me (All they keep asking me)
Is if Im gonna be your bride
The only kinda girl they see (Only kinda girl they see)
Is a one-night or a wife

I find it dizzying (Yeah, oh, yeah)
Theyre bringing up my history (Yeah, oh, yeah)
But you werent even listening (Yeah, oh, yeah)

The lavender haze creepin up on me

We were in the backseat
Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar
I rent a place on Cornelia Street
I say casually in the car
We were a fresh page on the desk
Filling in the blanks as we go
As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
Leading us home
And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
Id never walk Cornelia Street again
Thats the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
Id never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, Im so terrified of if you ever walk away
Id never walk Cornelia Street again
Id never walk Cornelia Street again
Windows flung right open, autumn air
Jacket round my shoulders is yours
We bless the rains on Cornelia Street
Memorize the creaks in the floor
Back when we were card sharks, playing games
I thought you were leading me on
I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street
Before you even knew I was gone

But then you called, showed your hand
I turned around before I hit the tunnel
Sat on the roof, you and I
I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
Id never walk Cornelia Street again
Thats the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
Id never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name (City screams your name)
And baby, Im so terrified of if you ever walk away
Id never walk Cornelia Street again
Id never walk Cornelia Street again
You hold my hand on the street
Walk me back to that apartment
Years ago, we were just inside
Barefoot in the kitchen
Sacred new beginnings
That became my religion, listen
I hope I never lose you
Id never walk Cornelia Street again
Oh, never again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name (City screams your name)
And baby, Im so terrified of if you ever walk away
Id never walk Cornelia Street again
Id never walk Cornelia Street again
I dont wanna lose you (Hope it never ends)
Id never walk Cornelia Street again
I dont wanna lose you (Yeah)

My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
Everyone looked worse in the light
There are so many lines that Ive crossed unforgiven
Ill tell you the truth but never goodbye
I dont wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I dont wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
Ive been sleepin so long in a twenty-year dark night
And now I see daylight, I only see daylight
Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
And so I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Clearin the air, I breathed in the smoke
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
Maybe Ive stormed out of every single room in this town
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because its morning now
Its brighter now, now
I dont wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
I dont wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things will never be the same)
Ive been sleepin so long in a twenty-year dark night
(Now Im wide awake)
And now I see daylight (Daylight), I only see daylight (Daylight)

I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
And I can still see it all (In my mind)
All of you, all of me (Intertwined)
I once believed love would be (Black and white)
But its golden (Golden)
And I can still see it all (In my head)
Back and forth from New York (Sneakin in your bed)
I once believed love would be (Burnin red)
But its golden
Like daylight, like daylight
Like daylight, daylight
I dont wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
And I dont wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things will never be the same)
Ive been sleepin so long in a twenty-year dark night
(Now Im wide awake)
And now I see daylight (I see daylight), I only see daylight (Ah)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight (Ah)
(And I can still see it all)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
(And I can still see it all, back and forth from New York)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
(I once believed love would be burning red)
Like daylight
Its golden like daylight
You gotta step into the daylight and let it go
Just let it go, let it go
I wanna be defined by the things that I love
Not the things I hate
Not the things Im afraid of, Im afraid of
Or the things that haunt me in the middle of the night
I, I just think that
You are what you love62Embed
If I wanted to know who you were hanging with
While I was gone, I wouldve asked you
Its the kind of cold, fogs up windshield glass
But I felt it when I passed you
Theres an ache in you, put there by the ache in me
But if its all the same to you
Its the same to me
So we could call it even
You could call me babe for the weekend
​Tis the damn season, write this down
Im stayin at my parents house
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown
I parkеd my car right between the Methodist
And thе school that used to be ours
The holidays linger like bad perfume
You can run, but only so far
I escaped it too, remember how you watched me leave
But if its okay with you, its okay with me
We could call it even
You could call me babe for the weekend
​Tis the damn season, write this down
Im stayin at my parents house
And the road not taken looks real good now
Time flies, messy as the mud on your truck tires
Now Im missing your smile, hear me out
We could just ride around
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown

Sleep in half the day just for old times sake
I wont ask you to wait if you dont ask me to stay
So Ill go back to L.A. and the so-called friends
Wholl write books about me if I ever make it
And wonder about the only soul
Who can tell which smiles Im fakin
And the heart I know Im breakin is my own
To leave the warmest bed Ive ever known
We could call it even
Even though Im leaving
And Ill be yours for the weekend
​Tis the damn season
We could call it even
You could call me babe for the weekend
​Tis the damn season, write this down
Im stayin at my parents house
And the road not taken looks real good now
Time flies, messy as the mud on your truck tires
Now Im missing your smile, hear me out
We could just ride around
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown
It always leads to you and my hometown52Embed
Is it romantic how all my elegies eulogize me?
Im not cut out for all these cynical clones
These hunters with cell phones
Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I dont belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
Im setting off, but not without my muse
What should be over burrowed under my skin
In heart-stopping waves of hurt
Ive come too far to watch some namedropping sleaze
Tell me what are my words worth
Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I dont belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
Im setting off, but not without my muse
I want auroras and sad prose
I want to watch wisteria grow right over my bare feet
Cause I havent moved in years
And I want you right here
A red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground
With no one around to tweet it
While I bathe in cliffside pools
With my calamitous love and insurmountable grief

Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I dont belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
Im setting off, but not without my muse
No, not without you64Embed
We can go drivin in, on my scooter
Uh, you know, just round London (Oh, Id—)
I love my hometown as much as Motown, I love SoCal
And you know I love Springsteen, faded blue jeans, Tennessee whiskey
But somethin happened, I heard him laughin
I saw the dimples first and then I heard the accent
They say home is where the heart is
But thats not where mine lives
You know I love a London boy
I enjoy walkin Camden Market in the afternoon
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
Boy, I fancy you (Ooh)
And now I love high tea, stories from Uni, and the West End
You can find me in the pub, we are watchin rugby with his school friends
Show me a gray sky, a rainy cab ride
Babes, dont threaten me with a good time
They say home is where the heart is
But, God, I love the English

You know I love a London boy
I enjoy nights in Brixton, Shoreditch in the afternoon
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
Boy, I fancy you
So please show me Hackney
Doesnt have to be Louis V up on Bond Street
Just wanna be with you
Wanna be with you
Stick with me, Im your queen
Like a Tennessee Stella McCartney on the Heath
Just wanna be with you (Wanna be with you)
Wanna be with you, oh, woah
You know I love a London boy
I enjoy walkin Soho, drinkin in the afternoon (Yeah)
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you (You)
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true (Yeah)
You know I love a London boy (Oh)

You know I adore you, Im crazier for you
Than I was at 16, lost in a film scene
Waving homecoming queens, marching band playing
Im lost in the lights
American glory faded before me
Now Im feeling hopeless, ripped up my prom dress
Running through rose thorns, I saw the scoreboard
And ran for my life (Ah)
No cameras catch my pageant smile
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
Its been a long time coming, but
Its you and me, thats my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, Shes a bad, bad girl (Okay)
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
Its you and me, theres nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay)
Were so sad, we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away with you

My team is losing, battered and bruising
I see the high fives between the bad guys
Leave with my head hung, you are the only one
Who seems to care
American stories burning before me
Im feeling helpless, the damsels are depressed
Boys will be boys then, where are the wise men?
Darling, Im scared (Ah)
No cameras catch my muffled cries
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
And now the storm is coming, but
Its you and me, thats my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, Shes a bad, bad girl (Okay)
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
Its you and me, theres nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay)
Were so sad, we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away with you
And I dont want you to (Go), I dont really wanna (Fight)

Baby love, I think Ive been a little too kind
Didnt notice you walkin all over my peace of mind
In the shoes I gave you as a present
Puttin someone first only works when youre in their top five
And by the way, Im goin out tonight
Best believe Im still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band
They ask, Do you have a man?
I could still say, I dont remember
Familiarity breeds contempt
Dont put mе in the basement
Whеn I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real, I polish up real nice
Nice
Baby boy, I think Ive been too good of a girl (Too good of a girl)
Did all the extra credit, then got graded on a curve
I think its time to teach some lessons
I made you my world (Huh), have you heard? (Huh)
I can reclaim the land
And I miss you (Miss you), but I miss sparklin (Nice)

Best believe Im still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band
They ask, Do you have a man?
I could still say, I dont remember
Familiarity breeds contempt
Dont put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real, I polish up real nice
Nice
Sapphire tears on my face
Sadness became my whole sky
But some guy said my auras moonstone
Just cause he was high
And were dancin all night
And you can try to change my mind
But you might have to wait in line
Whats a girl gonna do?
A diamonds gotta shine
Best believe Im still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer (Shimmer)
And when I meet the band
They ask, Do you have a man?
I could still say, I dont remember
Familiarity breeds contempt
Dont put me in the basement

When you think of all the late nights
Lame fights over the phone
Wake up in the mornin with someone
But feelin alone
A heart is drawn around your name
In someones handwriting, not mine
Sneakin out into town
Holdin hands, just killin time
Your past and mine are parallel lines
Stars all aligned and they intertwined
And taught you
The way you call me baby
Treat me like a lady
All that I can say is
All of the girls you loved before (Ooh)
Made you the one Ive fallen for
Every dead-end street led you straight to me
Now youre all I need, Im so thankful for
All of the girls you loved before
But I love you more

When I think of all the makeup
Fake love out on the town (Ooh)
Cryin in the bathroom for some dude
Whose name I cannot remember now
Secret jokes all alone
No ones home, sixteen and wild (Ooh)
Breakin up, makin up
Leave without sayin goodbye (Ooh)
And just know that
Its everything that made me
Now I call you baby
Its why youre so amazing
All of the girls you loved before (Ooh)
Made you the one Ive fallen for
Every dead-end street led you straight to me
Now youre all I need, Im so thankful for
All of the girls you loved before

Your mother brought you up loyal and kind
Teenage love taught you theres good in goodbye
Every woman that you knew brought you here
I wanna teach you how forever feels like
The girls you loved before (Ooh)
Made you the one Ive fallen for
Every dead-end street (Dead-end street) led you straight to me (Straight to me)

I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, This is it, Ive had enough, cause like
We hadnt seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space (What?)
Then you come around again and say
Baby, I miss you and I swear Im gonna change, trust me
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, I hate you, we break up, you call me, I love you
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
We called it off again last night, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, Im telling you, Im telling you
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together
Like, ever
Im really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, screaming that Im right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record thats much cooler than mine

You called me up again tonight, but

Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but its not enough
’Cause the morning comes and youre not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandeliers still flickering here
’Cause I cant pretend its okay when its not
Its death by a thousand cuts
I dress to kill my time, I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if itll be alright
They say, I dont know
And what once was ours is no ones now
I see you everywhere, the only thing we share
Is this small town
You said it was a great love, one for the ages
But if the story’s over, why am I still writing pages?

’Cause saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but its not enough
’Cause the morning comes and youre not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandeliers still flickering here
Cause I can’t pretend its okay when its not
Its death by a thousand cuts
My heart, my hips, my body, my love
Tryna find a part of me that you didnt touch
Gave up on me like I was a bad drug
Now Im searching for signs in a haunted club
Our songs, our films, united we stand
Our country, guess it was a lawless land
Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
Paper cut stings from our paper-thin plans
My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust
Tryna find a part of me you didnt take up
Gave you too much, but it wasnt enough
But Ill be alright, its just a thousand cuts
I get drunk, but its not enough
Cause youre not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandeliers still flickering here
Cause I cant pretend its okay when its not
No, its not
Its death by a thousand cuts (You didnt touch)
Tryna find a part of me that you didnt touch
My body, my love, my trust (Its death by a thousand cuts)
But it wasnt enough, it wasnt enough, no, no
I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if itll be alright
They say, I dont know76Embed
I spy with my little tired eye
Tiny as a firefly
A pebble that we picked up last July
Down deep inside your pocket
We almost forgot it
Does it ever miss Wicklow sometimes?
Ooh, ooh
They said the end is comin
Everyone’s up to somethin
I find myself runnin home to your sweet nothings
Outside, they’re push and shovin
Youre in the kitchen hummin
All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin
On the way home
I wrote a poem
You say, What a mind
This happens all the time
Ooh, ooh
Causе they said the end is comin
Evеryones up to somethin’
I find myself runnin’ home to your sweet nothings
Outside, theyre push and shovin’
Youre in the kitchen hummin
All that you ever wanted from me was nothin

Industry disruptors and soul deconstructors
And smooth-talking hucksters out glad-handing each other
And the voices that implore, You should be doing more
To you, I can admit that I’m just too soft for all of it
Ooh
They said the end is comin
Everyones up to somethin
I find myself runnin home to your sweet nothings
Outside, theyre push and shovin
Youre in the kitchen hummin
All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin
They said the end is comin (They said the end is comin)
Everyones up to somethin (Everyones up to somethin)
I find myself runnin home to your sweet nothings
Outside, theyre push and shovin (Outside, theyre push and shovin)

Im perfectly fine, I live on my own
I made up my mind, Im better off bein alone
We met a few weeks ago
Now you try on callin me baby like tryin on clothes
Salute to me, Im your American queen
And you move to me like Im a Motown beat
And we rule the kingdom inside my room
Cause all the boys and their expensive cars
With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars
Never took me quite where you do
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body and soul, ooh-woah
And all at once, youre all I want, Ill never let you go
King of my heart, body and soul, ooh-woah
And all at once, Ive been waiting, waiting
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah
And all at once, you are the one, I have been waiting, waiting
Body and soul, ooh-woah
And all at once

Late in the night, the citys asleep
Your love is a secret Im hoping, dreaming, dying to keep
Change my priorities
The taste of your lips is my idea of luxury
Salute to me, Im your American queen
And you move to me like Im a Motown beat
And we rule the kingdom inside my room (Inside my room, oh)
Cause all the boys and their expensive cars
With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars
Never took me quite where you do (Where you do)

Is this the end of all the endings?
My broken bones are mending
With all these nights were spending
Up on the roof with a school girl crush
Drinking beer out of plastic cups
Say you fancy me, not fancy stuff
Baby, all at once, this is enough
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body and soul, ooh-woah

No words appear before me in the aftermath
Salt streams out my eyes and into my ears
Every single thing I touch becomes sick with sadness
Cause its all over now, all out to sea
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
You were bigger than the whole sky
You were more than just a short time
And Ive got a lot to pine about
Ive got a lot to live without
Im never gonna meet
What couldve been, wouldve been
What shouldve been you
What couldve been, wouldve been you
Did some bird flap its wings ovеr in Asia?
Did some force take you bеcause I didnt pray?
Every single thing to come has turned into ashes
Cause its all over, its not meant to be
So Ill say words I dont believe
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
You were bigger than the whole sky
You were more than just a short time
And Ive got a lot to pine about
Ive got a lot to live without
Im never gonna meet
What couldve been, wouldve been
What shouldve been you

What couldve been, wouldve been you
What couldve been, wouldve been
What shouldve been you
What couldve been, wouldve been you
(What couldve been, wouldve been you)
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
You were bigger than the whole sky
You were more than just a short time
And Ive got a lot to pine about
Ive got a lot to live without
Im never gonna meet

Once upon a time, the planets and the fates
And all the stars aligned
You and I ended up in the same room
At the same time
And the touch of a hand lit the fuse
Of a chain reaction of countermoves
To assess the equation of you
Checkmate, I couldnt lose
What if I told you none of it was accidental?
And the first night that you saw me
Nothing was gonna stop me
I laid the groundwork, and then
Just like clockwork
The dominoes cascaded in a line
What if I told you Im a mastermind?
And now youre mine
It was all by dеsign
Cause Im a mastermind
You see, all the wisеst women
Had to do it this way
Cause we were born to be the pawn
In every lovers game

If you fail to plan, you plan to fail
Strategy sets the scene for the tale
Im the wind in our free-flowing sails
And the liquor in our cocktails
What if I told you none of it was accidental?
And the first night that you saw me
I knew I wanted your body
I laid the groundwork, and then
Just like clockwork
The dominoes cascaded in a line
What if I told you Im a mastermind?
And now youre mine
It was all my design
Cause Im a mastermind
No one wanted to play with me as a little kid
So Ive been scheming like a criminal ever since
To make them love me and make it seem effortless
This is the first time Ive felt the need to confess
And I swear
Im only cryptic and Machiavellian
Cause I care
So I told you none of it was accidental
And the first night that you saw me
Nothing was gonna stop me
I laid the groundwork, and then
Saw a wide smirk on your face
You knew the entire time
You knew that Im a mastermind
And now youre mine
Yeah, all you did was smile
Cause Im a mastermind25Embed
Theres glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me from the night before, but
Don’t read the last page
But I stay when youre lost and Im scared and you’re turning away
I want your midnights
But Ill be cleaning up bottles with you on New Years Day
You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi
I can tell that its gonna be a long road
Ill be there if youre the toast of the town, babe
Or if you strike out and youre crawling home
Dont read the last page
But I stay when it’s hard or it’s wrong or were making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I’ll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Years Day
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you

Please, dont ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
Please, dont ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
There’s glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me forevermore
Dont read the last page
But I stay when its hard or its wrong or were making mistakes
I want your midnights
But Ill be cleaning up bottles with you on New Years Day
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you
Please, dont ever become a stranger
(To the memories, they will hold on to you)
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
(Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you)
Please, dont ever become a stranger

And the tennis court was covered up
With some tent-like thing
And you asked me to dance
But I said, Dancin is a dangerous game
Oh, I thought
This is gonna be one of those things
Now I know
Im never gonna love again
Ive got some tricks up my sleeve
Takes one to know one
Youre a cowboy like me
Never wanted love
Just a fancy car
Now Im waiting by the phone
Like Im sitting in an airport bar
You had some tricks up your sleeve
Takes one to know one
Youre a cowboy like me

Perched in the dark
Tellin all the rich folks anything they wanna hear
Like it could be love
I could be the way forward
Only if they pay for it
Youre a bandit like me
Eyes full of stars
Hustling for the good life
Never thought Id meet you here
It could be love
We could be the way forward
And I know Ill pay for it
Youre a cowboy like me
Perched in the dark
Tellin all the rich folks anything they wanna hear
Like it could be love
I could be the way forward
Only if they pay for it
Youre a bandit like me
Eyes full of stars
Hustlin for the good life
Never thought Id meet you here
It could be love
We could be the way forward
And I know Ill pay for it
And the skeletons in both our closets
Plotted hard to fuck this up
And the old men that Ive swindled
Really did believe I was the one
And the ladies lunchin have their stories about
When you passed through town
Oh, but that was all before I locked it down
Now you hang from my lips
Like the Gardens of Babylon
With your boots beneath my bed
Forever is the sweetest con
Ive had some tricks up my sleeve
Takes one to know one
Youre a cowboy like me
And Im never gonna love again
Im never gonna love again
Im never gonna love again63Embed
It only hurts this much right now
Was what I was thinkin the whole time
Breathe in, breathe through, breathe deep, breathe out
Ill be gettin over you my whole life
You know how scared I am of elevators
Never trust it if it rises fast
It cant last
Uh-oh, Im fallin in love
Oh no, Im fallin in love again
Oh, Im fallin in love
I thought the plane was goin down
Howd you turn it right around?
It only feels this raw right now
Lost in the labyrinth of my mind
Break up, break free, break through, break down
You would break your back to make me break a smile
You know how much I hate
That everybody just expects me to bounce back
Just like that

Uh-oh, Im fallin in love
Oh no, Im fallin in love again
Oh, Im fallin in love
I thought the plane was goin down
Howd you turn it right around?
Uh-oh, Im fallin in love
Oh no, Im fallin in love again

Break my soul in two looking for you
But youre right here
If I cant relate to you anymore
Then who am I related to?
And if this is the long haul
Howd we get here so soon?
Did I close my fist around something delicate?
Did I shatter you?
And Im sitting on a bench in Coney Island
Wondering where did my baby go?
The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go
Sorry for not making you my centerfold
Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down
The question pounds my head
Whats a lifetime of achievement
If I pushed you to the edge?
But you were too polite to leave me
And do you miss the rogue
Who coaxed you into paradise and left you there?
Will you forgive my soul
When youre too wise to trust me and too old to care?

Cause we were like the mall before the internet
It was the one place to be
The mischief, the gift-wrapped suburban dreams
Sorry for not winning you an arcade ring
Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down
Were you waiting at our old spot
In the tree line
By the gold clock
Did I leave you hanging every single day?
Were you standing in the hallway
With a big cake, happy birthday
Did I paint your bluest skies the darkest grey?
A universe away
And when I got into the accident
The sight that flashed before me was your face
But when I walked up to the podium, I think that I forgot to say your name
Im on a bench in Coney Island
Wondering where did my baby go?
The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go
Sorry for not making you my centerfold
Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down
The sight that flashed before me was your face
When the sun goes down
But I think that I forgot to say your name
Over and over
Sorry for not making you my, making you my
Making you my centerfold51Embed
I blew things out of proportion, now youre blue
Put you in jail for something you didn’t do
I pinned your hands behind your back, oh
Thought I had reason to attack, but no
Fighting with a true love is boxing with no gloves
Chemistry til it blows up, til there’s no us
Whyd I have to break what I love so much?
Its on your face, and Im to blame, I need to say
Hey, its all me, in my head
Im the one who burned us down
But its not what I meant
Sorry that I hurt you
I dont wanna do, I don’t wanna do this to you (Ooh)
I don’t wanna lose, I dont wanna lose this with you (Ooh)
I need to say, hey, it’s all me, just dont go
Meet me in the afterglow
Its so excruciating to see you low
Just wanna lift you up and not let you go
This ultraviolet morning light below
Tells me this love is worth the fight, oh

I lived like an island, punished you with silence
Went off like sirens, just crying
Whyd I have to break what I love so much?
It’s on your face, dont walk away, I need to say
Hey, its all me, in my head
Im the one who burned us down
But its not what I meant
Im sorry that I hurt you
I dont wanna do, I dont wanna do this to you (Ooh)
I dont wanna lose, I dont wanna lose this with you (Ooh)
I need to say, hey, its all me, just dont go
Meet me in the afterglow
Tell me that youre still mine
Tell me that well be just fine
Even when I lose my mind
I need to say
Tell me that its not my fault
Tell me that Im all you want
Even when I break your heart
I need to say
Hey, its all me, in my head
Im the one who burned us down
But its not what I meant
Sorry that I hurt you
I dont wanna do, I dont wanna do this to you (Ooh)

The moon is high
Like your friends were the night that we first met
Went home and tried to stalk you on the internet
Now Ive read all of the books beside your bed
The wine is cold
Like the shoulder that I gave you in the street
Cat and mouse for a month or two or three
Now I wake up in the night and watch you breathe
(Ayy)
Kiss me once cause you know I had a long night (Oh)
Kiss me twice cause its gonna be alright (Uh)
Three times cause I waited my whole life (1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4)
I like shiny things, but Id marry you with paper rings
Uh huh, thats right
Darling, youre the one I want, and
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Uh huh, thats right
Darling, youre the one I want
In paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams
Oh, youre the one I want

In the winter, in the icy outdoor pool
When you jumped in first, I went in too
Im with you even if it makes me blue
Which takes me back
To the color that we painted your brothers wall
Honey, without all the exes, fights, and flaws
We wouldnt be standing here so tall, so
(Ayy)
Kiss you once cause I know you had a long night (Oh)
Kiss you twice cause its gonna be alright (Uh)
Three times cause you waited your whole life (1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4)

My knuckles were bruised like violets
Sucker punching walls, cursed you as I sleep-talked
Spineless in my tomb of silence
Tore your banners down, took the battle underground
And maybe it was egos swinging
Maybe it was her
Flashes of the battle come back to me in a blur
All that bloodshed, crimson clover
Uh-huh, sweet dream was over
My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War
Always remember
Uh-huh, tears on the lеtter
I vowed not to cry anymore
If wе survived the Great War
You drew up some good faith treaties
I drew curtains closed, drank my poison all alone
You said I have to trust more freely
But diesel is desire, you were playing with fire
And maybe its the past thats talking
Screaming from the crypt
Telling me to punish you for things you never did
So I justified it

All that bloodshed, crimson clover
Uh-huh, the bombs were closer
My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War
Always remember
Uh-huh, the burning embers
I vowed not to fight anymore
If we survived the Great War
Uh-huh, uh-huh
It turned into something bigger
Somewhere in the haze, got a sense Id been betrayed
Your finger on my hairpin triggers
Soldier down on that icy ground
Looked up at me with honor and truth
Broken and blue, so I called off the troops
That was the night I nearly lost you
I really thought Id lost you
We can plant a memory garden
Say a solemn prayer, place a poppy in my hair
Theres no morning glory, it was war, it wasnt fair
And we will never go back
To that bloodshed, crimson clover
Uh-huh, the worst was over
My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War
Always remember
Uh-huh, were burned for better
I vowed I would always be yours
Cause we survived the Great War
Uh-huh, uh-huh
I will always be yours
Cause we survived the Great War
Uh-huh
I vow I will always be yours27Embed
How many days did I spend thinking
Bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong?
Lived in the shade you were throwing
Til all of my sunshine was gone, gone, gone
And I couldnt get away from ya
In my feelings more than Drake, so yeah
Your name on my lips, tongue-tied
Free rent, living in my mind
But then something happened one magical night
I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didnt
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
It isnt love, it isnt hate, its just indifference
I forgot that you
Got out some popcorn
As soon as my rep started going down, down, down
Laughed on the school yard
As soon as I tripped up and hit the ground, ground, ground
And I wouldve stuck around for ya
Wouldve fought the whole town, so yeah
Wouldve been right there, front row
Even if nobody came to your show

But you showed who you are, then one magical night
I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didnt
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
It isnt love, it isnt hate, its just indifference
I forgot that you
Sent me a clear message
Taught me some hard lessons
I just forget what they were
Its all just a blur
I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didnt
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
I did, I did, I did
It isnt hate, its just indifference
It isnt love, it isnt hate, its just indifference

Youre on the phone with your girlfriend, shes upset
Shes going off about something that you said
Cause she doesnt get your humor like I do
Im in the room, its a typical Tuesday night
Im listening to the kind of music she doesnt like
And shell never know your story like I do
But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
Shes Cheer Captain and Im on the bleachers
Dreaming bout the day when you wake up and find
That what youre looking for has been here the whole time
If you could see that Im the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why cant you see?
You belong with me, you belong with me
Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I cant help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isnt this easy?
And youve got a smile that could light up this whole town
I havent seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say youre fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?

She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
Shes Cheer Captain and Im on the bleachers
Dreaming bout the day when you wake up and find
That what youre looking for has been here the whole time
If you could see that Im the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why cant you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time, how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me
Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
Im the one who makes you laugh
When you know youre bout to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know its with me
Cant you see that Im the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why cant you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time, how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me
You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me?
You belong with me97Embed
We were crazy to think
Crazy to think that this could work
Remember how I said Id die for you?
We were stupid to jump
In the ocean separating us
Remember how I’d fly to you?
And I cant talk to you when youre like this
Staring out the window like I’m not your favorite town
Im New York City
I still do it for you, babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When youre led by blind faith, blind faith
But we might just get away with it
Religions in your lips
Even if its a false god
Wed still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if its a false god
Wed still worship this love
We’d still worship this love
We’d still worship this love

I know heavens a thing
I go there when you touch me, honey
Hell is when I fight with you
But we can patch it up good
Make confessions and we’re begging for forgiveness
Got the wine for you
And you cant talk to me when Im like this
Daring you to leave me just so I can try and scare you
Youre the West Village
You still do it for me, babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When you’re led by blind faith, blind faith
But we might just get away with it
Religions in your lips
Even if its a false god
Wed still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if its a false god
Wed still worship this love
Wed still worship this love
Wed still worship this love, ah
Still worship this love
Even if its a false god
Even if its a false god
Still worship this love69Embed
It was so nice throwing big parties
Jump into the pool from the balcony
Everyone swimming in a champagne sea
And there are no rules when you show up here
Bass beat rattling the chandelier
Feeling so Gatsby for that whole year
So, whyd you have to rain on my parade?
Im shaking my head and locking the gates
This is why we cant have nice things, darling
Because you break them, I had to take them away
This is why we cant have nice things, honey (Oh)
Did you think I wouldnt hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we cant have nice things
It was so nice being friends again
There I was, giving you a second chance
But you stabbed me in the back while shaking my hand
And therein lies the issue, friends dont try to trick you
Get you on the phone and mind-twist you
And so I took an axe to a mended fence

But Im not the only friend youve lost lately (Mm-mm)
If only you werent so shady
This is why we cant have nice things, darling (Yeah)
Because you break them, I had to take them away
This is why we cant have nice (Nice things) things (Baby), honey
Did you think I wouldnt hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we cant have—
Heres a toast to my real friends
They dont care about the he-said, she-said
And heres to my baby
He aint reading what they call me lately
And heres to my mama
Had to listen to all this drama
And heres to you
Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do
Haha, I cant even say it with a straight face
This is why we cant have nice things, darling (Darling)
Because you break them, I had to take them away
This is why we cant have nice (Uh-uh) things (Oh, no), honey (Baby, oh)
Did you think I wouldnt hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we cant have nice things, darling

Because you break them, I had to take them

See you in the dark
All eyes on you, my magician
All eyes on us
You make everyone disappear, and
Cut me into pieces
Gold cage, hostage to my feelings
Back against the wall
Trippin, trip-trippin when youre gone
Cause we break down a little
But when you get me alone, its so simple
Cause, baby, I know what you know
We can feel it
And all the pieces fall right into place
Getting caught up in a moment
Lipstick on your face
So it goes
Im yours to keep
And Im yours to lose
You know Im not a bad girl, but I
Do bad things with you
So it goes

Met you in a bar
All eyes on me, your illusionist
All eyes on us
I make all your gray days clear
And wear you like a necklace
Im so chill, but you make me jealous
But I got your heart
Skippin, skip-skippin when Im gone
Cause we break down a little
But when I get you alone, its so simple
Cause, baby, I know what you know
We can feel it
And all the pieces fall right into place
Getting caught up in a moment

I, I loved you in secret
First sight, yeah, we love without reason
Oh, twenty-five years old
Oh, how were you to know? And
My, my love had been frozen
Deep blue, but you painted me golden
Oh, and you held me close
Oh, how was I to know? I–
Couldve spent forever with your hands in my pockets
Picture of your face in an invisible locket
You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it
I had a bad feeling
And darling, you had turned my bed into a sacred oasis
People started talking, putting us through our paces
I knew there was no one in the world who could take it
I had a bad feeling
But we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
Like it was the first time, first time
Yeah, we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
And I had a bad feeling
But we were dancing

I, I loved you in spite of
Deep fears that the world would divide us
So, baby, can we dance
Oh, through an avalanche? And
Say, say that we got it
Im a mess, but Im the mess that you wanted
Oh, cause its gravity
Oh, keeping you with me, I–
Couldve spent forever with your hands in my pockets
Picture of your face in an invisible locket
You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it

Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied

And I had a bad feeling
But we were dancing
Id kiss you as the lights went out
Swaying as the room burned down
Id hold you as the water rushes in
If I could dance with you again
Id kiss you as the lights went out
Swaying as the room burned down
Id hold you as the water rushes in
If I could dance with you again (Again)

Fatefully
I tried to pick my battles til the battle picked me
Misery
Like the war of words I shouted in my sleep
And you passed right by
I was in the alley, surrounded on all sides
The knife cuts both ways
If the shoe fits, walk in it til your high heels break
And I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short, it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Clung to the nearest lips
Long story short, it was the wrong guy
Now Im all about you
Im all about you, ah
Yeah, yeah
Im all about you, ah
Yeah, yeah
Actually
I always felt I must look better in the rear view
Missing me
At the golden gates they once held the keys to
When I dropped my sword
I threw it in the bushes and knocked on your door
And we live in peace
But if someone comes at us, this time, Im ready

Cause I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short, it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Clung to the nearest lips
Long story short, it was the wrong guy
Now Im all about you
Im all about you, ah
Yeah, yeah
Im all about you
No more keepin score
Now I just keep you warm (Keep you warm)
No more tug of war
Now I just know theres more (Know theres more)
No more keepin score
Now I just keep you warm (Keep you warm)
And my waves meet your shore
Ever and evermore
Past me
I wanna tell you not to get lost in these petty things
Your nemeses
Will defeat themselves before you get the chance to swing
And hes passing by
Rare as the glimmer of a comet in the sky
And he feels like home
If the shoe fits, walk in it everywhere you go
And I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short, it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Climbed right back up the cliff
Long story short, I survived
Now Im all about you
(And now) Im all about you, ah
(And now) Im all about you
(And now) Im all about you, ah
Yeah, yeah
Im all about you

I said, Remember this moment
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives would
Never be the same
You held your head like a hero on a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age
Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, Long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered
I said, Remember this feeling
I pass the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, This is absurd
Cause for a moment, a band of thieves in ripped up jeans
Got to rule the world

Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, Long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders, Im not afraid
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, Long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered
Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall
Will you take a moment? Promise me this
That youll stand by me forever
But if, God forbid, fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children some day
When they point to the pictures
Please tell em my name
Tell em how the crowds went wild
Tell em how I hope they shine
Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you
Long, long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
And I was screaming, Long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders, Im not afraid
Singing, Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
And long, long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered35Embed

They tell you while youre young
Girls, go out and have your fun
Then they hunt and slay the ones who actually do it
Criticize the way you fly
When youre soaring through the sky
Shoot you down and then they sigh
And say, She looks like shes been through it
Lord, what will become of me
Once Ive lost my novelty?
Ive had too much to drink tonight
And I know its sad, but this is what I think about
And I wake up in the middle of the night
Its like I can feel time moving
How can a person know everythin at eighteen
But nothin at twenty-two?
And will you still want me
When Im nothing new?
How long will it be cute, all this cryin in my room?
When you cant blame it on my youth
And roll your eyes with affection
And my cheeks are growing tired
From turning red and faking smiles
Are we only biding time til I lose your attention?

And someone else lights up the room (Ah)
People love an ingénue (Ah)
Ive had (Ive had) too much to drink tonight
How did I go from growin up to breaking down?
And I wake up (Wake up) in the middle of the night
Its like I can feel time movin
How can a person know everything at eighteen
But nothing at twenty-two?
And will you still want me
When Im nothing new?
I know someday Im gonna meet her, its a fever dream
The kind of radiance you only have at seventeen
Shell know the way and then shell say she got the map from me
Ill say Im happy for her, then Ill cry myself to sleep
Oh, woah, oh (Oh)

The drought was the very worst (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
When the flowers that wed grown together died of thirst
It was months and months of back and forth (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Youre still all over me
Like a wine-stained dress I cant wear anymore
Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm
Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, thats when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
There was nothing left to do (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
When the butterflies turned to
Dust that covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you
The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud
But no one heard a thing

Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, thats when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I think I am finally clean
(Oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Said, I think I am finally clean
(Oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Ten months sober, I must admit
Just because youre clean dont mean you dont miss it
Ten months older, I wont give in
Now that Im clean, Im never gonna risk it
The drought was the very worst (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
When the flowers that wed grown together died of thirst
(Oh)
The rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, thats when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
Rain came pouring down

High infidelity
Put on your records and regret me
I bent the truth too far tonight
I was dancing around, dancing around it
High infidelity
Put on your headphones and burn my city
Your picket fence is sharp as knives
I was dancing around, dancing around it
Do you really wanna know where I was April 29th?
Do I really have to chart the constellations in his eyes?
Storm coming, good husband
Bad omen
Dragged my feet right down the aisle
At the house lonely, good money
Id pay if youd just know me
Seemed like the right thing at the time

You know theres many different ways that you can kill the one you love
The slowest way is never loving them enough

And I complained the whole way there
The car ride back and up the stairs
I shouldve asked you questions
I shouldve asked you how to be
Asked you to write it down for me
Shouldve kept every grocery store receipt
Cause every scrap of you would be taken from me
Watched as you signed your name Marjorie
All your closets of backlogged dreams
And how you left them all to me
What died didnt stay dead

Friends break up, friends get married
Strangers get born, strangers get buried
Trends change, rumors fly through new skies
But Im right where you left me
Matches burn after the other
Pages turn and stick to each other
Wages earned and lessons learned
But I, Im right where you left me
Help, Im still at the restaurant
Still sitting in a corner I haunt
Cross-legged in the dim light
They say, What a sad sight
I, I swear you could hear a hair pin drop
Right when I felt the moment stop
Glass shattered on the white cloth
Everybody moved on, I, I stayed there
Dust collected on my pinned-up hair
They expected me to find somewhere
Some perspective, but I sat and stared
Right where you left me
You left me no, you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever
You left me, you left me no, oh, you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever

Did you ever hear about the girl who got frozen?
Time went on for everybody else, she wont know it
Shes still twenty-three inside her fantasy
How it was supposed to be
Did you hear about the girl who lives in delusion?
Breakups happen every day, you dont have to lose it
Shes still twenty-three inside her fantasy
And youre sitting in front of me
At the restaurant when I was still the one you want
Cross-legged in the dim light, everything was just right
I, I could feel the mascara run
You told me that you met someone
Glass shattered on the white cloth
Everybody moved on
Help, Im still at the restaurant
Still sitting in a corner I haunt
Cross-legged in the dim light
They say, What a sad sight
I, I stayed there
Dust collected on my pinned-up hair
Im sure that you got a wife out there
Kids and Christmas, but Im unaware
Cause Im right where I cause no harm
Mind my business
If our love died young
I cant bear witness
And its been so long
But if you ever think you got it wrong
Im right where
You left me
You left me no, oh, you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever
You left me
You left me no, oh, you left me no

The buttons of my coat were tangled in my hair
In doctors office lighting, I didnt tell you I was scared
That was the first time we were there
Holy orange bottles, each night, I pray to you
Desperate people find faith, so now I pray to Jesus too
And I say to you...
Ooh-ah
Soon, youll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, youll get better
Ooh-ah
Youll get better soon
Cause you have to
I know delusion when I see it in the mirror
You like the nicer nurses, you make the best of a bad deal
I just pretend it isnt real
Ill paint the kitchen neon, Ill brighten up the sky
I know Ill never get it, theres not a day that I wont try
And I say to you...
Ooh-ah
Soon, youll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, youll get better
Ooh-ah
Youll get better soon
Cause you have to

And I hate to make this all about me
But who am I supposed to talk to?
What am I supposed to do
If theres no you?
This wont go back to normal, if it ever was
Its been years of hoping, and I keep saying it because

Looking at it now
It all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember
You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered (Then discovered)
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinking
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
(Are we out of the woods?)
Looking at it now
Last December (Last December)
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together (Back together)
Ooh, your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldnt quite forget
When we decided, we decided
To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby, like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
And I remember thinking

Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? (Oh) Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good

Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?
Twenty stitches in the hospital room
When you started crying, baby, I did too
But when the sun came up, I was looking at you
Remember when we couldnt take the heat?
I walked out, I said, Im setting you free
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
When the sun came up, you were looking at me
You were looking at me, ooh
You were looking at me
(Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?)
(Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?)
I remember
(Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?)
(Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good)
Oh, I remember
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet? (Yeah, yeah)
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet? (Say, are we?)

Its been a long time
And seeing the shape of your name
Still spells out pain
It wasnt right
The way it all went down
Looks like you know that now
Yes, I got your letter
Yes, Im doing better
It cut deep to know ya, right to the bone
Yes, I got your letter
Yes, Im doing better
I know that its over, I dont need your
Closure, your closure
Dont treat me like
Some situation that needs to be handled
Im fine with my spite
And my tears, and my beers and my candles
I can feel you smoothing me over
Yes, I got your letter
Yes, Im doing bettеr
It cut deep to know ya, right to the bone
Yes, I got your lеtter
Yes, Im doing better
I know that its over, I dont need your
Closure, your closure
Your closure, your closure

I know Im just a wrinkle in your new life
Staying friends would iron it out so nice
Guilty, guilty, reaching out across the sea
That you put between you and me
But its fake and its oh so unnecessary
Yes, I got your letter
Yes, Im doing better
It cut deep to know ya, right to the bone
Yes, I got your letter
Yes, Im doing better
I know that its over, I dont need your
Closure, closure, your closure
Your closure29Embed
There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you
Your eyes whispered, Have we met?
Across the room, your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you
This night is sparkling, dont you let it go
Im wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
Ill spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you
The lingering question kept me up
2AM, who do you love?
I wonder til Im wide awake
Now, Im pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
Id open up and you would say
Hey, it was enchanting to meet you
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling, dont you let it go
Im wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
Ill spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless, dont you let it go
Im wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
Ill spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the storyline ends
My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again
These are the words I held back
As I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you
Please dont be in love with someone else
Please dont have somebody waiting on you
Please dont be in love with someone else (Ooh)
Please dont have somebody waiting on you (Ooh, oh)
This night is sparkling, dont you let it go
Im wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
Ill spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless (Please dont be in love with someone else)
Dont you let it go
Im wonderstruck (Please dont have somebody waiting on you)
Dancing around all alone
Ill spend forever (Please dont be in love with someone else)
Wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you
Please dont be in love with someone else
Please dont have somebody waiting on you69Embed
I know Im probably better off on my own
Than lovin’ a man who didnt know what he had when he had it
And I see the permanent damage you did to me
Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic
I wish it wasnt 4 AM, standing in the mirror
Saying to myself, You know you had to do it
I know the bravest thing I ever did was run
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
I know I’m probably better off all alone
Than needing a man who could change his mind
At any given minute
And it was always on your terms
I waited on every careless word
Hoping they might turn sweet again
Like it was in the beginning

But your jealousy, oh, I can hear it now
Talking down to me like Id always be around
Push my love away like it was some kind of loaded gun
Oh, you never thought Id run
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye, like the back of my hand
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
I hold onto this pride because these days its all I have
And I gave to you my best
And we both know you cant say that
I wish you were a better man
I wonder what we wouldve become
If you were a better man
We might still be in love
If you were a better man
You wouldve been the one
If you were a better man
Yeah, yeah
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye, like the back of my hand
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
(Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again)
We might still be in love, if you were a better man
(But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man)
Yeah, yeah
I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
We might still be in love
If you were a better man
You wouldve been the one

Dear reader, if it feels like a trap
Youre already in one
Dear reader, get out your map
Pick somewhere and just run
Dear reader, burn all the files
Desert all your past lives
And if you dont recognize yourself
That means you did it right
Never take advice from someone whos falling apart
Never take advice from someone whos falling apart (You should find another)
Dear reader, bend when you can
Snap when you have to
Dear reader, you dont have to answer
Just cause they asked you
(You should find another)
Dear reader, the greatest of luxuries is your secrets
Dear reader, when you aim at the devil
Make sure you dont miss
Never take advice from someone whos falling apart
Never take advice from someone whos falling apart

So I wander through these nights
I prefer hiding in plain sight
My fourth drink in my hand
These desperate prayers of a cursed man
Spilling out to you for free
But darling, darling, please
You wouldnt take my word for it if you knew who was talking
If you knew where I was walking
To a house, not a home, all alone cause nobodys there
Where I pace in my pen and my friends found friends who care
No one sees when you lose when youre playing solitaire
You should find another guiding light, guiding light
But I shine so bright
You should find another guiding light, guiding light
But I shine so bright
You should find another, you should find another (Guiding light)
Find another, you should find another
You should find another11Embed
Your ex-friends sister
Met someone at a club and he kissed her
Turns out, it was that guy you hooked up with ages ago
Some wannabe Z-lister
And all the outfits were terrible
2003 unbearable
Did you see the photos?
No, I didnt, but thanks, though
Im so in love that I might stop breathing
Drew a map on your bedroom ceiling
No, I didnt see the news
Cause we were somewhere else
Stumbled down pretend alleyways
Cheap wine, make believe its champagne
I was taken by the view
Like we were in Paris
Like we were somewhere else
Like we were in Paris, oh
We were somewhere else
Privacy sign on the door
And on my page and on the whole world
Romance is not dead if you keep it just yours
Levitate above all the messes made
Sit quiet by my side in the shade
And not the kind thats thrown
I mean, the kind under where a tree has grown

Im so in love that I might stop breathing
Drew a map on your bedroom ceiling
No, I didnt see the news
Cause we were somewhere else
Stumbled down pretend alleyways
Cheap wine, make believe its champagne
I was taken by the view
Like we were in Paris, oh
Like we were somewhere else
Like we were in Paris, oh
We were somewhere else
I wanna brainwash you
Into loving me forever
I wanna transport you
To somewhere the cultures clever
Confess my truth
In swooping, sloping, cursive letters
Let the only flashing lights be the tower at midnight
In my mind
We drew a map on your bedroom ceiling
No, I didnt see the news
Cause we were somewhere else
In an alleyway, drinking champagne
Cause we were in Paris
Yes, we were somewhere else
My love, we were in Paris
Yes, we were somewhere else15Embed
Cracked her bones on the pavement she once decorated
as a child with sidewalk chalk
When she crashed, her clothes disintegrated and blew away
with the winds that took all of her fair-weather friends
When she looked around, her skin was spattered with ink
forming the words of a thousand voices
Echoes she heard even in her sleep:
Whatever you say, it is not right.
Whatever you do, it is not enough.
Your kindness is fake.
Your pain is manipulative.
When she lay there on the ground,
She dreamed of time machines and revenge
and a love that was really something,
Not just the idea of something.
When she finally rose, she rose slowly
Avoiding old haunts and sidestepping shiny pennies
Wary of phone calls and promises,
Charmers, dandies and get-love-quick-schemes
When she stood, she stood with a desolate knowingness
Waded out into the dark, wild ocean up to her neck
Bathed in her brokenness
Said a prayer of gratitude for each chink in the armor
she never knew she needed
Standing broad-shouldered next to her
was a love that was really something,
not just the idea of something.
When she turned to go home,
She heard the echoes of new words
May your heart remain breakable
But never by the same hand twice
And even louder:
without your past,
you could never have arrived-
so wondrously and brutally,
By design or some violent, exquisite happenstance
...here.
And in the death of her reputation,
She felt truly alive.29Embed
Flashing lights
And we took a wrong turn
And we fell down a rabbit hole
You held on tight to me
Cause nothings as it seems
And spinning out of control
Didnt they tell us Dont rush into things?
Didnt you flash your green eyes at me?
Havent you heard what becomes of curious minds?
Ooh, didnt it all seem new and exciting?
I felt your arms twistin around me
I should have slept with one eye open at night
We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever (Eh, eh)
We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it
And life was never worse, but never better (Eh, eh)
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
In Wonderland
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
In Wonderland
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)

(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)

So, we went on our way
Too in love to think straight
All alone, or so it seemed
But there were strangers watchin
And whispers turned to talkin
And talking turned to screams, oh
Didnt they tell us Dont rush into things?
Didnt you flash your green eyes at me?
Didnt you calm my fears with a Cheshire cat smile?
Ooh, didnt it all seem new and exciting?
I felt your arms twistin around me
Its all fun and games til somebody loses their mind
But darling
We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever (Eh, eh)
We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better (Eh, eh)
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
In Wonderland
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh) Eh, eh
In Wonderland
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
In Wonderland
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh) Woah
In Wonderland
I reached for you, but you were gone
I knew I had to go back home
You searched the world for somethin else
To make you feel like what we had
And in the end, in Wonderland, we both went mad
Oh
We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever (Last forever; Eh, eh)
We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it (Got lost in it)
And life was never worse but never better (Never better; Eh, eh)
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
And we pretended it could last forever (In Wonderland)

It feels like a perfect night
To dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes
Uh-uh, uh-uh
It feels like a perfect night
For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers
Uh-uh, uh-uh
Yeah
Were happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time
Its miserable and magical, oh, yeah
Tonights the night when we forget about the deadlines

It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded
Too many cool kids

And end up dreamin
Instead of sleeping

Ooh
Ooh
School bell rings, walk me home
Sidewalk chalk covered in snow
Lost my gloves, you give me one
Wanna hang out? Yeah, sounds like fun
Video games, you pass me a note
Sleeping in tents
Its nice to have a friend (Ooh)
Its nice to have a friend (Ooh)
Light pink sky, up on the roof
Sun sinks down, no curfew
20 questions, we tell the truth
Youve been stressed out lately, yeah, me too
Something gave you the nerve
To touch my hand
Its nice to have a friend (Ooh)
Its nice to have a friend (Ooh)

Church bells ring, carry me home
Rice on the ground looks like snow
Call my bluff, call you Babe
Have my back, yeah, every day
Feels like home, stay in bed
The whole weekend
Its nice to have a friend (Ooh)
Its nice to have a friend (Ooh)
Its nice to have a friend (Ooh)

I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone, and Lord, it took me away
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light, go
Hey, you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke wed made
And that was the first day
And darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground
Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big wide city all to ourselves
We blocked the noise with the sound of, I need you
And for the first time, I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the storys got dust on every page
But sometimes, I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd

Cause darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground
Tonight, Im gonna dance
For all that weve been through
But I dont wanna dance
If Im not dancing with you
Tonight, Im gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I dont wanna dance
If Im not dancing with you
It was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground
Tonight, Im gonna dance
For all that weve been through
But I dont wanna dance
If Im not dancing with you
Tonight, Im gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I dont wanna dance
If Im not dancing with you27Embed
3 AM and Im still awake, Ill bet youre just fine
Fast asleep in your city thats better than mine
And the girl in your bed has a fine pedigree
And Ill bet your friends tell you shes better than me, huh
Well, I tried to fit in with your upper-crust circles
Yeah, they let me sit in back when we were in love
Oh, they sit around talkin about the meaning of life
And the book that just saved em that I hadnt heard of
But now that were done and its over
I bet you couldnt believe
When you realized Im harder to forget than I was to leave
And I bet you think about me
You grew up in a silver-spoon gated community
Glamorous, shiny, bright Beverly Hills
I was raised on a farm, no, it wasnt a mansion
Just livin room dancin and kitchen table bills
But you know what they say, you cant help who you fall for
And you and I fell like an early spring snow
But reality crept in, you said were too different
You laughed at my dreams, rolled your eyes at my jokes

Mr. Superior Thinkin
Do you have all the space that you need?
I dont have to be your shrink to know that youll never be happy
And I bet you think about me
I bet you think about me, yes
I bet you think about me
Oh, block it all out
The voices so loud, sayin
Why did you let her go?
Does it make you feel sad
That the love that youre lookin for
Is the love that you had?
Now youre out in the world, searchin for your soul
Scared not to be hip, scared to get old
Chasing make-believe status, last time you felt free
Was when none of that shit mattered cause you were with me
But now that were done and its over
I bet its hard to believe
But it turned out Im harder to forget than I was to leave
And, yeah, I bet you think about me
I bet you think about me, yes
I bet you think about me
I bet you think about me when youre out
At your cool indie music concerts every week
I bet you think about me in your house
With your organic shoes and your million-dollar couch
I bet you think about me when you say
Oh my god, shes insane, she wrote a song about me
I bet you think about me34Embed
Long were the nights when
My days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Praying the floor wont fall through again
And my mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine
You paint me a blue sky
Then go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules everyday
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone tonight
Well, I stopped pickin up and this song is to let you know why
Dear John, I see it all now that youre gone
Dont you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I shouldve known
Well, maybe its me
And my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe its you and your sick need
To give love and take it away
And youll add my name to your long list of traitors
Who dont understand
And I look back in regret how I ignored when they said
Run as fast as you can

Dear John, I see it all now that youre gone
Dont you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong
Dont you think nineteens too young
To be played by your dark, twisted games when I loved you so?
I shouldve known
You are an expert at sorry and keeping lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that youve run dry have tired lifeless eyes
Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches before fire could catch me
So dont look now
Im shining like fireworks over your sad empty town
Oh, oh
Dear John, I see it all now that youre gone
Dont you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I see it all now that youre gone
Dont you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress wrote you a song
You shouldve known
You shouldve known
Dont you think I was too young?

When the dinner is cold and the chatter gets old
You ask for the tab
Or that moment again, hes insisting that friends
Look at each other like that
When the words of a sister come back in whispers
That prove she was not in fact what she seemed
Not a twin from your dreams
Shes a crook who was caught
That old familiar body ache
The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul
You know when its time to go
Twenty years at your job
Then the son of the boss gets the spot that was yours
Or trying to stay for the kids
When keeping it how it is will only break their hearts worse
That old familiar body ache
The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul
You know when its time to go

Sometimes giving up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walking out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing
Sometimes giving up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walking out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing
Fifteen years, fifteen million tears
Begging til my knees bled
I gave it my all, he gave me nothing at all
Then wondered why I left
Now he sits on his throne in his palace of bones
Praying to his greed
Hes got my past frozen behind glass
But Ive got me
That old familiar body ache
The snaps from the same little breaks in my soul
I know when its time to go
Sometimes giving up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walking out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing
Sometimes giving up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walking out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing
That will find you the right thing
And you know in your soul
You know in your soul
When its time to go
You know, you know, you know, you know
When its time to go
So then you go
Then you go
You just go36Embed
Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didnt like it when I wore high heels
But I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didnt get this song
But I do, I do
I walked in, expecting youd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you dont know how nice that is
But I do
And you throw your head back laughin like a little kid
I think its strange that you think Im funny cause he never did
Ive been spending the last eight months
Thinkin all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday, in a café, I watched it begin again
You said you never met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you
But I do
We tell stories and you dont know why
Im comin off a little shy
But I do

But you throw your head back laughin like a little kid
I think its strange that you think Im funny cause he never did
Ive been spending the last eight months
Thinkin all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday, in a café, I watched it begin again
And we walked down the block to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies
That your family watches every single Christmas
And I wanna talk about that
And for the first time, whats past is past
Cause you throw your head back laughin like a little kid
I think its strange that you think Im funny cause he never did
Ive been spending the last eight months
Thinkin all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday, in a café, I watched it begin again
Hmm, hmm
But on a Wednesday, in a café, I watched it begin again40Embed
Were all bored, were all so tired of everything
We wait for trains that just arent coming
We show off our different scarlet letters
Trust me, mine is better
Were so young, but were on the road to ruin
We play dumb, but we know exactly what were doing
We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
Honey, life is just a classroom
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
Cause baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
Baby, were the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, were the new romantics
The best people in life are free
Were all here, the lights and noise are blinding
We hang back, its all in the timing
Its poker, he cant see it in my face
But Im about to play my Ace (Ahh)
We need love, but all we want is danger
We team up, then switch sides like a record changer
The rumors are terrible and cruel
But, honey, most of them are true
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)

Cause baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle (Every day is like a battle)
But every night with us is like a dream
Baby, were the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing (Yeah)
To get knocked off our feet (Hey!)
Baby, were the new romantics
The best people in life are free
(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
Oh-oh
(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
So, come on, come along with me
(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
The best people in life are free
(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
Please, take my hand and
Please, take me dancing and
Please, leave me stranded
Its so romantic (Its so romantic)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
Cause baby, I could build a castle (Oh, baby, I could build a castle)
Out of all the bricks they threw at me (At me)
And every day is like a battle (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
But every night with us is like a dream (Like a dream)
Cause baby, I could build a castle (Castle)

Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me
You found me-e-e-e-e
I guess you didnt care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me
Without me-e-e-e-e
And hes long gone when hes next to me
And I realize the blame is on me
Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now

Pretends he doesnt know that hes the reason why
Youre drowning, youre drowning
Youre drowning-ing-ing-ing-ing
And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all Ill ever be
And now, I see, now, I see

And I realize the joke is on me, yeah

Comes creeping in
That you never loved me
Or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been (Never been)
Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (Knew it right there)
So shame on me now (Knew it right there)
Flew me to places Id never been (Ooh)

Trouble, trouble, trouble (Oh)
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble

Clear blue water
High tide came and brought you in
And I could go on and on, on and on and I will
Skies grew darker
Currents swept you out again
And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone
In silent screams and wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this
This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Tossing, turning
Struggled through the night with someone new
Baby, I could go on and on, on and on
Lantern, burning
Flickered in my mind, only you
But you were still gone, gone, gone

Been losing grip on sinking ships
You showed up just in time
This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh
This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark, oh-oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh-oh, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh-oh, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh-oh, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love)
Your kiss, my cheek, I watched you leave
Your smile, my ghost, I fell to my knees
When youre young, you just run
But you come back to what you need
This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh
(This love) This love left a permanent mark

Im walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love til it hurts or bleeds
Or fades in time
And I never (Never)
Saw you coming
And I’ll never (Never)
Be the same
You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now, all we know is don’t let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes
So you were never a saint
And Ive loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild

And I never (Never)
Saw you coming
And I’ll never (Never)
Be the same
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You’re my Achilles heel
This is the golden age
Of something good and right and real
And I never (Never)
Saw you coming
And I’ll never
Be the same
And I never (Never)
Saw you coming
And I’ll never (So you were never a saint)
(And Ive loved in shades of wrong)
Be the same (We learn to live with the pain)

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight

We were supposed to be just friends
You dont live in my part of town, but maybe Ill see you out some weekend
Depending on what kind of mood and situationship Im in
And whats in my system
I think theres been a glitch, oh, yeah
Five seconds later, Im fastening myself to you with a stitch, oh, yeah
And Im not even sorry, nights are so starry
Blood moonlit
It must be counterfeit
I think theres been a glitch, oh, yeah
I was supposed to sweat you out
In search of glorious happenings of happenstance on someone elses playground
But its been two-thousand one-hundred ninety days of our love blackout
(Our love is blacking out)
The systems breaking down
(The systems breaking down)
I think theres been a glitch, oh, yeah
Five seconds later, Im fastening myself to you with a stitch, oh, yeah
And Im not even sorry, nights are so starry
Blood moonlit
It must be counterfeit
I think theres been a glitch

A brief interruption, a slight malfunction
Id go back to wanting dudes who give nothing
I thought we had no chance
And thats romance, lets dance
Glitch, oh, yeah
Five seconds later, Im fastening myself to you with a stitch, oh, yeah
And Im not even sorry, nights are so starry
Blood moonlit

One look, dark room
Meant just for you
Time moved too fast, you play it back
Buttons on a coat, lighthearted joke
No proof, not much, but you saw enough
Small talk, he drives
Coffee at midnight
The light reflects the chain on your neck
He says, Look up
And your shoulders brush
No proof, one touch, but you felt enough
You can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you
You can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you
You can see it with the lights out (Lights out), lights out (Lights out)
You are in love, true love
You are in love
Morning, his place
Burnt toast, Sunday
You keep his shirt, he keeps his word
And for once, you let go
Of your fears and your ghosts
One step, not much, but it said enough
You kiss on sidewalks
You fight and you talk
One night, he wakes
Strange look on his face
Pauses, then says Youre my best friend
And you knew what it was, he is in love

You can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you
You can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you
You can see it with the lights out (Lights out), lights out (Lights out)
You are in love, true love
And so it goes
You two are dancing in a snow globe, round and round
And he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown
And you understand now
Why they lost their minds and fought the wars
And why Ive spent my whole life trying to put it into words
Cause you can hear it in the silence
You can feel it on the way home
You can see it with the lights out
You are in love, true love
You are in love
You can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you
You can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you
You can see it with the lights out (Lights out), lights out (Lights out)
You are in love, true love
You are in love (Ah)
You can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you (Ah)
You can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you (Ah)

Once the last drop of rain has dried off the pavement
Shouldnt I find a stain? But I never do
The way the tires turn stones on old county roads
They leave em muddy underneath, reminds me of you
You find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls, you know
You can scratch it right off, its how it used to be
But like the dollar in your pocket, its been spent and traded in
You cant change where its been, reminds me of me
I lived and I learned
Had you, got burned
Held out and held on
God knows, too long, and wasted time
Lost tears, swore that Id get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
Ive still got you all over me
The best and worst day of June
Was the one that I met you
With your hands in your pockets
And your Dont you wish you had me? grin
Well I did, so I smiled, and I melted like a child
Now, every breath of air I breathe reminds me of then

And I lived and I learned
Had you, got burned
Held out and held on
God knows, too long, and wasted time
Lost tears, swore that Id get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
Ive still got you all over me

I lived and I learned
And found out what it was to turn around
And see that we
Were never really meant to be
So I lied, and I cried
And I watched a part of myself die
Cause no amount of freedom gets you clean
Ive still got you all over me
Ive still got you all over me
Still got you all over me39Embed

All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now
Know something now I didnt before
And all Ive seen since 18 hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind, making me feel like
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
And everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
Youll be mine and Ill be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

And all my walls stood tall, painted blue
And Ill take em down, take em down
And open up the door for you
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
The beautiful kind, making up for lost time
Taking flight, making me feel right
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you
Cause all I know is we said, Hello
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
And everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
Youll be mine and Ill be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed
Come back and tell me why
Im feeling like Ive missed you all this time
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that its not all in my mind
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you
Cause all I know is we said, Hello
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
And everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
Youll be mine and Ill be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed
All I know is we said, Hello
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain
And everything has changed
All I know is a new found grace
All my days, Ill know your face

I used to think one day, wed tell the story of us
How we met and the sparks flew instantly
And people would say, Theyre the lucky ones
I used to know my place was the spot next to you
Now, Im searching the room for an empty seat
Cause lately, I dont even know what page youre on
Oh, a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fallout
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up, I cant break through
Now, Im standing alone in a crowded room
And were not speaking
And Im dying to know
Is it killing you like its killing me? Yeah
I dont know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
Next chapter

Howd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy
And youre doing your best to avoid me
Im starting to think one day, Ill tell the story of us
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like you shouldve held me
Oh, Im scared to see the ending
Why are we pretending this is nothing?
Id tell you I miss you, but I dont know how
Ive never heard silence quite this loud
Now, Im standing alone in a crowded room
And were not speaking
And Im dying to know
Is it killing you like its killing me? Yeah
I dont know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
This is looking like a contest
Of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side
The battles in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down
If you said youd rather love than fight
So many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon
Now, Im standing alone in a crowded room
And were not speaking
And Im dying to know
Is it killing you like its killing me? Yeah
I dont know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
The story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now
And were not speaking
And Im dying to know
Is it killing you like its killing me? Yeah
I dont know what to say since the twist of fate
Cause were goin down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

Oh, Carolina creeks running through my veins
Lost I was born, lonesome I came
Lonesome Ill always stay
Carolina knows why, for years, I roam
Free as these birds, light as whispers
Carolina knows
And you didnt see me here
No, they never did see me here
And shes in my dreams
Into the mist, into the clouds
Dont leave
I make a fist, Ill make it count
And there are places I will never, ever go
And things that only Carolina will ever know
Carolina stains on the dress she left
Indelible scars, pivotal marks
Blue as the life she fled
Carolina pines, wont you cover me?
Hide me like robes down the back road
Muddy these webs we weave

And you didnt see me here
Oh, they never did see me
And shes in my dreams
Into the mist, into the clouds
Dont leave
I make a fist, Ill make it count
And there are places I will never, ever go
And things that only Carolina will ever know
And you didnt see me here
They never did see me here
No, you didnt see me here
They never saw me
Oh, Carolina knows why for years theyve said
That I was guilty as sin and sleep in a liars bed
But the sleep comes fast and Ill meet no ghosts
Its between me, the sand, and the sea
Carolina knows29Embed
I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered for just us to know
You told me you loved me
So why did you go away?
Away
I do recall now, the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement
I ran off the plane
That July ninth, the beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt
I can still feel your arms
But now Ill go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes
All that I know is I dont know
How to be something you miss
I never thought wed have a last kiss
Never imagined wed end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

I do remember the swing of your step
The life of the party, youre showing off again
And Id roll my eyes and then youd pull me in
Im not much for dancing, but for you, I did
Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How youd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something
Theres not a day I dont miss those rude interruptions
And Ill go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes
All that I know is I dont know
How to be something you miss
I never thought wed have a last kiss
I never imagined wed end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips, ooh
So Ill watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
And Ill keep up with our old friends
Just to ask them how you are
Hope its nice where you are
And I hope the sun shines and its a beautiful day
And something reminds you, you wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in the weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind
So, Ill go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes
All that I know is I dont know
How to be something you miss
I never thought wed have a last kiss
Never imagined wed end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips
Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips
Forever the name on my lips
Just like our last42Embed
He says he doesnt believe anything much he hears these days
He says, Why fall in love, just so you can watch it go away?
He spends most of his nights wishing it was how it used to be
He spends most of his flights getting pulled down by gravity
I call, just checking up on him
Hes up, 3 AM, pacing
He says, Its not just a phase Im in
My voice comes out begging
All this time, I didnt know
You were breaking down
Id fall to pieces on the floor
If you werent around
Too young to know it gets better
Ill be summer sun for you forever
Forever winter if you go
He seems fine most of the time
Forcing smiles and never minds
His laugh is a symphony
When the lights go out, its hard to breathe
I pull at every thread trying to solve the puzzles in his head
Live my life scared to death hell decide to leave instead

I call, just checking up on him
Hes up, 5 AM, wasted
Long gone, not even listening
My voice comes out screaming
All this time, I didnt know
You were breaking down
Id fall to pieces on the floor
If you werent around
Too young to know it gets better
Ill be summer sun for you forever
Forever winter if you go
If I was standing there in your apartment
Id take that bomb in your head and disarm it
Id say I love you even at your darkest and
Please dont go
I didnt know
You were breaking down
Id fall to pieces on the floor
If you werent around
Too young to know it gets better
Ill be summer sun for you forever
Forever winter if you go
Ill be your summer sun forever
At 3 AM, pacing
All this time, I didnt know
At 5 AM, wasted
Id be in pieces on the floor
Forever winter if you go
He says he doesnt believe anything much he hears these days
I say, Believe in one thing, I wont go away41Embed
I remember tears streaming down your face when I said, Ill never let you go
When all those shadows almost killed your light
I remember you said, Dont leave me here alone
But all thats dead and gone and passed tonight
Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
Youll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and Ill be safe and sound
Dont you dare look out your window
Darling, everythings on fire
The war outside our door keeps raging on
Hold on to this lullaby
Even when (the) musics gone
Gone
Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
Youll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and Ill be safe and sound

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Oh (Oh)
Oh (Oh)

Just close your eyes
Youll be alright

Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once youre already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all
Losing him was blue like Id never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody youve never met
But loving him was red
(Red, red)
(Red, red)
Loving him was red
(Red, red)
(Red, red)
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing theres no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong
Losing him was blue like Id never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Whoa)
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody youve never met
But loving him was red

(Red, red)
Oh, red (Red, red)
Burning red (Red, red)
(Red, red)
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself its time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Burning, it was red
Oh, losing him was blue like Id never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Whoa)
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody youve never met
Cause loving him was red
(Red, red) Yeah, yeah, red (Red, red)
Burning red (Red, red)
(Red, red)
And thats why (Red, red) hes spinning round in my head
Comes back to me (Red, red), burning red
(Red, red) Yeah, yeah

I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I-I (I, I, I, I)
You stand with your hand on my waistline
Its a scene and were out here in plain sight
I can hear them whisper as we pass by
Its a bad sign, bad sign
Something happens when everybody finds out
See the vultures circling, dark clouds
Loves a fragile little flame, it could burn out
It could burn out
Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes and guns
They are the hunters, we are the foxes and we run
Baby, I know places we wont be found
And theyll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places, I know places

Lights flash and well run for the fences
Let them say what they want, we wont hear it
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time
Not this time
Just grab my hand and dont ever drop it, my love
They are the hunters, we are the foxes, and we run
Baby, I know places we wont be found
And theyll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places
They are the hunters, we are the foxes, and we run
Just grab my hand and dont ever drop it, my love
Baby, I know places we wont be found
And theyll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places
They take their shots, but were bulletproof (I know places)
And you know for me, its always you (I know places)
In the dead of night, your eyes so green (I know places)
And I know for you, its always me (I know places)
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I-I
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I-I

We could leave the Christmas lights up til January
And this is our place, we make the rules
And theres a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home
Youre my, my, my, my lover
We could light a bunch of candles
And dance around the kitchen, baby
Pictures of when we were young would hang on the wall
We would sit on the stoop
Ill sing love songs to you when were eighty
See, I finally got you now, honey, I wont let you fall
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
Youre my, my, my, my lover

Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
Look in my eyes, they will tell you the truth
The girl in my story has always been you
Id go down with the Titanic, its true, for you, lover
And youll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, Ill save you a seat, lover (Save you a seat)
Can I go where you go? (Can I go where you go, baby?)
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
Youre my, my, my, my
Oh, youre my, my, my, my
Darling, youre my, my, my, my lover11Embed
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
You were in college working part time waitin tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
Wonderin why we bother with love if it never lasts
I say, Can you believe it?
As were lyin on the couch
The moment I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now
Do you remember, we were sittin there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
You are the best thing thats ever been mine
Flash forward and were takin on the world together
And theres a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why Im guarded
You say well never make my parents mistakes

But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about
Do you remember, we were sittin there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
You are the best thing thats ever been mine
Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
You are the best thing thats ever been mine
Oh-oh, oh-oh
And I remember that fight, 2:30AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
Cause thats all Ive ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said, Ill never leave you alone
You said, I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, its like the first time
I fell in love with a careless mans careful daughter
She is the best thing thats ever been mine
Hold on, make it last
Hold on, never turn back
(Hold on) You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter (Make it last)
(Hold on) You are the best thing thats ever been mine (Hold on)
Yes, yes, do you believe it? (Hold on)
Yes, yes, were gonna make it now (Hold on)
Yes, yes, I can see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now45Embed
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
Im standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, Hello
Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, Stay away from Juliet
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, Please dont go, and I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
Ill be waiting, all theres left to do is run
Youll be the prince and Ill be the princess
Its a love story, baby, just say, Yes
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet cause were dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, Stay away from Juliet
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, Please dont go, and I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
Ill be waiting, all theres left to do is run
Youll be the prince and Ill be the princess
Its a love story, baby, just say, Yes
Romeo, save me, theyre trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but its real
Dont be afraid, well make it out of this mess
Its a love story, baby, just say, Yes
Oh, oh
And I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town
And I said, Romeo, save me, Ive been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I dont know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
Marry me, Juliet, youll never have to be alone
I love you and thats all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
Its a love story, baby, just say, Yes
Oh, oh, oh

People like you always want back
The love they gave away
And people like me wanna believe you
When you say youve changed
The more I think about it now
The less I know
All I know is that you drove us
Off the road
(Stay) Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand, then
Whyd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?
(Stay) Hey, now you say you want it back
Now that its just too late
Well, couldve been easy
All you had to do was (Stay)
All you had to do was (Stay)

Here you are now, calling me up
But I dont know what to say
Ive been picking up the pieces
Of the mess you made
People like you always want back
The love they pushed aside
But people like me are gone forever
When you say goodbye

Had me in the palm of your hand, then
Whyd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?

Put your lips close to mine
As long as they dont touch
Out of focus, eye to eye
Til the gravitys too much
And Ill do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And Id be smart to walk away
But youre quicksand
This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I-I-I like it
I cant decide if its a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
And all we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow
But youre friction

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
I, I, I like it
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you, get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I would follow you, follow you home
Ill follow you, follow you home
This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous
I-I-I, I-I-I, I-I-I
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you, get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I would follow you, follow you home
Ill follow you, follow you home
Ill follow you, follow you home
Ill follow you, follow you home
This slope is treacherous
I-I-I like it30Embed
Now, go stand in the corner and think about what you did
Ha, time for a little revenge
The story starts when it was hot and it was summer, and
I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone, and lets hear the applause
She took him faster than you can say Sabotage
I never saw it coming, wouldnt have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from
Shes not a saint and shes not what you think
Shes an actress, woah
Shes better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, woah
Soon, shes gonna find stealing other peoples toys
On the playground wont make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha
She looks at life like its a party and shes on the list
She looks at me like Im a trend and shes so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling, and
She thinks Im psycho cause I like to rhyme her name with things
But sophistication isnt what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
Oh, they didnt teach you that in prep school so its up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
(Think about what you did)

Shes not a saint and shes not what you think
Shes an actress, woah
Shes better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, woah
Soon, shes gonna find stealing other peoples toys
On the playground wont make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha
Im just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but havent you heard?
Im just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but I always get the last word
Woah, woah-ah-oh
Shes not a saint and shes not what you think
Shes an actress, woah (She deserved it)
Shes better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, woah
Soon, shes gonna find stealing other peoples toys
On the playground wont make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge
Do you still feel like you know what youre doing?
Cause I dont think you do, oh (No, no, no, no)
Do you still feel like you know what youre doing? (No)
I dont think you do, I dont think you do
Lets hear the applause (Come on, come on)
Come on, show me how much better you are
(So much better, yeah?)
See, you deserve some applause
Cause youre so much better
She took him faster than you could say Sabotage29Embed
Walking through a crowd, the village is aglow
Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
Everybody here wanted something more
Searching for a sound we hadnt heard before
And it said
Welcome to New York, its been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, its been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Its a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat, forevermore
The lights are so bright but they never blind me, me
Welcome to New York, its been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
Took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer
Everybody here was someone else before
And you can want who you want
Boys and boys and girls and girls
Welcome to New York, its been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, its been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Its a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat, forevermore
The lights are so bright, but they never blind me, me
Welcome to New York (New York), its been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

Like any great love, it keeps you guessing
Like any real love, its ever-changing
Like any true love, it drives you crazy
But you know you wouldnt change anything, anything, anything
Welcome to New York, its been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, its been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Its a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat
The lights are so bright, but they never blind me
Welcome to New York (New soundtrack)
Its been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
The lights are so bright but they never blind me
Welcome to New York
So bright, they never blind me

Its 2 AM in your car
Windows down, you pass my street, the memories start
You say its in the past, you drive straight ahead
Youre thinking that I hate you now
Cause you still dont know what I never said
I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that
Id never forget you as long as I live, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, its all good
I wish you would
Its 2 AM in my room
Headlights pass the window pane
I think of you
Were a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you want to run and hide
But it makes you turn right back around
I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that
Id never forget you as long as I live, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, its all good
I wish you would
I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for, and I
Wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, its all good
I wish you would

I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I
I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I
I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I
You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything and nothing
This mad, mad love makes you come running
To stand back where you stood
I wish you would, I wish you would
(I wish you would, I wish you would)
I wish you would, I wish you would
(I wish you would, I wish you would)
(I wish, I wish, I)
2 AM, here we are
See your face, hear my voice in the dark
Were a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
But it made us turn right back around
I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that
Id never forget you as long as I live, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, its all good
I wish you would
I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that

You bite your nails,
And laugh when youre nervous.
You promise people the world,
because thats what they want from you.
You like giving them what they want...
But darling, you need to stop,
If youre anything like me,
You knock on wood every time you make plans.
You cross your fingers, hold your breath,
Wish on lucky numbers and eyelashes
Your superstitions were the lone survivors of the shipwreck.
Rest In Peace, to your naive bravado...
If life gets too good now,
Darling, it scares you.
If youre anything like me,
You never wanted to lock your door,
Your secret garden gate or your diary drawer
Didnt want to face the you you dont know anymore
For fear she was much better before...
But Darling, now you have to.
If youre anything like me,
Theres a justice system in your head
For names youll never speak again,
And you make your ruthless rulings.
Each new enemy turns to steel
They become the bars that confine you,
In your own little golden prison cell...
But Darling, there is where you meet yourself.
If youre anything like me
Youve grown to hate your pride
To love your thighs
And no amount of friends at 25
Will fill the empty seats
At the lunch tables of your past
The teams that picked you last...
But Darling, you keep trying.
If youre anything like me,
You couldnt recognize the face of your love
Until they stripped you of your shiny paint
Threw your victory flag away
And you saw the ones who wanted you anyway...
Darling, later on you will thank your stars
for that frightful day.
If youre anything like me,
Im sorry.
But Darling, its going to be okay.24Embed
Im so glad you made time to see me
Hows life? Tell me, hows your family?
I havent seen them in a while
Youve been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die
So, this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying, Im sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you
Wishing Id realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time
These days, I havent been sleeping
Staying up, playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didnt call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall

And then the cold came, the dark days
When fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye
So, this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying, Im sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you
Wishing Id realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time
I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear Id love you right
Id go back in time and change it, but I cant
So, if the chain is on your door, I understand
But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying, Im sorry for that night
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you
Wishing Id realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time
All the time81Embed
One, two, three, four
Give me the keys, Ill bring the car back around
We shouldnt be in this town
And my so-called friends, they dont know
Id drive away before I let you go
So give me a reason and dont say no, no
Theres a chain round your throat, piece of paper where I wrote
Ill wait for you
Theres a key on the chain, theres a picture in a frame
Take it with you
And run, like youd run from the law
Darling, lets run
Run from it all
We can go where our eyes can take us
Go where no one else is, run
Ooh, well run
Ooh, well run
Ooh, well run
So you laugh like a child
And Ill sing like no one cares
No one to be, no one to tell
I could see this view a hundred times
Pale blue sky reflected in your eyes
So give me a reason and dont say no, no
And the note from the locket, you keep it in your pocket
Since I gave it to you
Theres a heart on your sleeve
Ill take it when I leave
And hold it for you

And run, like youd run from the law
Darling, lets run
Run from it all
We can go like theyre trying to chase us
Go where no one else is, run
Ooh, well run
Ooh, well run
Ooh, well run
Theres been this hole in my heart
This thing was a shot in the dark
Say youll never let em tear us apart
And Ill hold onto you while we run (And we run, and we run, and we run)
Like youd run from the law (And we run, and we run, and we run)
Darling, lets run (And we run, and we run, and we run)
Run from it all (And we run, and we run, and we run)
We can go where our eyes can take us (And we run, and we run, and we run)
Go where no one else is, run (And we run, and we run, and we run)
Ooh, well run (And we run, and we run, and we run)
Ooh, well run (And we run, and we run, and we run)
Ooh, well run (And we run, and we run, and we run)

Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once youre already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all
Losing him was blue like Id never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Woah)
Forgetting him was like tryin to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red (Red, red)
(Red, red)
But loving him was red (Red, red)
(Red, red)
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing theres no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong
Losing him was blue like Id never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Woah)
Forgetting him was like tryin to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red (Red, red)
Oh, red (Red, red)
Burning red (Red, red)
(Red, red)

Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself its time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible when I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Burning, it was red
Oh, losing him was blue like Id never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Woah)
Forgetting him was like tryin to know somebody you never met
Cause loving him was red (Red, red)
Yeah, yeah, red (Red, red)
Oh, burning red (Red, red)
(Red, red)
And thats why hes spinning round in my head (Red, red)
Comes back to me, burning red (Red, red)
(Red, red)
Yeah, yeah (Red, red)
His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street22Embed
You, with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feeling like Im nothing
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
Calling me out when Im wounded
You, pickin on the weaker man
Well, you can take me down
With just one single blow
But you dont know what you dont know
Someday, Ill be livin in a big old city
And all youre ever gonna be is mean
Someday, Ill be big enough so you cant hit me
And all youre ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
You, with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I dont already see them
I walk with my head down, trying to block you out
Cause Ill never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again

I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right now
Cause you cant lead me down that road
And you dont know what you dont know
Someday, Ill be livin in a big old city
And all youre ever gonna be is mean
Someday, Ill be big enough so you cant hit me
And all youre ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
And I can see you years from now in a bar
Talking over a football game
With that same big, loud opinion
But nobodys listening
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
Drunk and grumblin on about how I cant sing
But all you are is mean
All you are is mean
And a liar, and pathetic
And alone in life, and mean
And mean, and mean, and mean
But someday, Ill be livin in a big old city
And all youre ever gonna be is mean
Yeah, someday, Ill be big enough so you cant hit me
And all youre ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
Someday, Ill be livin in a big old city
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
And all youre ever gonna be is mean
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
Someday, Ill be big enough so you cant hit me

We think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them they have chosen to show us. We know our friend in a certain light, but we dont know them the way their lover does. Just the way their lover will never know them the same way that you do as their friend. Their mother knows them differently than their roommate, who knows them differently than their colleague. Their secret admirer looks at them and sees an elaborate sunset of brilliant color and dimension and spirit and pricelessness. And yet, a stranger will pass that person and see a faceless member of the crowd, nothing more. We may hear rumors about a person and believe those things to be true. We may one day meet that person and feel foolish for believing baseless gossip.
This is the first generation that will be able to look back on their entire life story documented in pictures on the internet, and together we will all discover the after-effects of that. Ultimately, we post photos online to curate what strangers think of us. But then we wake up, look in the mirror at our faces and see the cracks and scars and blemishes, and cringe. We hope someday well meet someone who will see that same morning face and instead see their future, their partner, their forever. Someone who will still choose us even when they see all of the sides of the story, all the angles of the kaleidoscope that is you.
The point being, despite our need to simplify and generalize absolutely everyone and everything in this life, humans are intrinsically impossible to simplify. We are never just good or just bad. We are mosaics of our worst selves and our best selves, our deepest secrets and our favorite stories to tell at a dinner party, existing somewhere between our well-lit profile photo and our drivers license shot. We are all a mixture of our selfishness and generosity, loyalty and self-preservation, pragmatism and impulsiveness. Ive been in the public eye since I was 15 years old. On the beautiful, lovely side of that, Ive been so lucky to make music for living and look out into crowds of loving, vibrant people. On the other side of the coin, my mistakes have been used against me, my heartbreaks have been used as entertainment, and my songwriting has been trivialized as oversharing.
When this album comes out, gossip blogs will scour the lyrics for the men they can attribute to each song, as if the inspiration for music is as simple and basic as a paternity test. There will be slideshows of photos backing up each incorrect theory, because its 2017 and if you didnt see a picture of it, it couldnt have happened right?
Let me say it again, louder for those in the back...
We think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them that they have chosen to show us.
There will be no further explanation
There will be just reputation.15Embed
It keeps me awake, the look on your face
The moment you heard the news
Youre screaming inside and frozen in time
You did all that you could do
The game was rigged, the ref got tricked
The wrong ones think they’re right
You were outnumbered this time
But only the young, only the young
Only the young, only the young
Can run
Can run
So run, and run, and run
So every day now
You brace for the sound youve only heard on TV
You go to class, scared
Wondering where the best hiding spot would be
And the big bad man and his big bad clan
Their hands are stained with red
Oh, how quickly they forget
They arent gonna help us
Too busy helping themselves
They arent gonna change this
We gotta do it ourselves
They think that its over
But its just begun

Only one thing can save us
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young
Only the young (Only the young; Dont say youre too tired to fight)
Only the young (Only the young; Its just a matter of time)
Only the young (Only the young; Up theres the finish line)
Only the young
Can run
Dont say youre too tired to fight
Its just a matter of time (Can run)
Up theres the finish line (So run, and run, and run)
Dont say youre too tired to fight
Its just a matter of time (So run)
Up theres the finish line (And run, and run, and run)

In the angels city, chasing fortune and fame
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream
You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
So overnight, you look like a sixties queen
Another name goes up in lights
Like diamonds in the sky
And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
But can you tell me now, you’re the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh
Now, it’s big black cars and Riviera views
And your lover in the foyer doesn’t even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
And they tell you that you’re lucky, but you’re so confused
Cause you don’t feel pretty, you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place

Another name goes up in lights
You wonder if you’ll make it out alive
And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
But can you tell me now, you’re the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh
It was a few years later, I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity and got the hell out
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the rose garden over Madison Square
And it took some time, but I understand it now
Cause now my name is up in lights
But I think you got it right
Let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh
And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh
Oh, whoa, oh, oh32Embed
The way you move is like a full on rainstorm and Im a house of cards
Youre the kind of reckless that should send me runnin
But I kinda know that I wont get far
And you stood there in front of me, just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldnt see what I was thinkin of
Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something thatll haunt me when youre not around
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
My mind forgets to remind me youre a bad idea
You touch me once and its really somethin
You find Im even better than you imagined I would be
Im on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you, I know its no good
And I could wait patiently, but I really wish you would
Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something thatll haunt me when youre not around
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keepin your eyes on me, its just wrong enough to make it feel right
And lead me up the staircase, wont you whisper soft and slow?
Im captivated by you, baby, like a firework show
Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk (Ah-ah), take away the pain
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something thatll haunt me when youre not around
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
And the sparks fly
Oh, baby, smile
And the sparks fly43Embed
Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me
You found me-e-e-e-e
I guess you didnt care and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me
Without me-e-e-e-e
And hes long gone when hes next to me
And I realize the blame is on me
Cause I knew you were troublе when you walked in
So shame on mе now
Flew me to places Id never been
Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been
Now Im lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble

No apologies, hell never see you cry
Pretends he doesnt know that hes the reason why
Youre drowning, youre drowning
Youre drowning-ing-ing-ing-ing
And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all Ill ever be
And now I see, now I see
Now I see-e-e-e-e
He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me, hey
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (Oh)
So shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been
Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been (Yeah)
Now Im lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh (Yeah)
Trouble, trouble, trouble (Trouble)
Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
And the saddest fear
Comes creeping in
That you never loved me or her
Or anyone, or anything, yeah
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been (Never been)
Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (Knew it right there)
So shame on me now (Knew it right there)
Flew me to places Id never been (Ooh)
Now Im lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble (Oh)
Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble (Trouble)
Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble23Embed
You shouldve been there
Shouldve burst through the door
With that Baby, Im right here smile
And it wouldve felt like
A million little shining stars had just aligned
And I wouldve been so happy
Christmas lights glisten
Ive got my eye on the door
Just waiting for you to walk in
But the time is ticking
People ask me how Ive been
As I comb back through my memory
How you said youd be here
You said youd be here
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And theyre all laughing
As Im looking around the room
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew

And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
When theres something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts
As I say hopelessly
He said hed be here
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And theyre all laughing
And asking me about you
But there was one thing missing (Missing)
And that was the moment I knew
What do you say
When tears are streaming down your face
In front of everyone you know?
And what do you do
When the one who means the most to you
Is the one who didnt show?
You shouldve been here
And I wouldve been so happy
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And theyre all standing around me, singing
Happy birthday to you
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You called me later
And said, Im sorry I didnt make it
And I said, Im sorry, too
And that was the moment I knew21Embed
Find myself at your door
Just like all those times before
I’m not sure how I got there
All roads, they lead me here
I imagine you are home
In your room, all alone
And you open your eyes into mine
And everything feels better
And right before your eyes
Im breaking, no past
No reasons why
Just you and me
This is the last time Im asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time Im asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye (Eye, eye)
You find yourself at my door
Just like all those times before
You wear your best apology
But I was there to watch you leave
And all the times I let you in
Just for you to go again
Disappear when you come back
Everything is better

And right before your eyes
Im aching, run fast
Nowhere to hide
Just you and me
This is the last time Im asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time Im asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye (Eye, eye)

This is the last time you tell me Ive got it wrong
This is the last time I say its been you all along
This is the last time I let you in my door
This is the last time, I wont hurt you anymore
Oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho
Oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho
This is the last time Im asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time Im asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye
This is the last time Im asking you this (This is the last time Im asking you this)
Put my name at the top of your list (Put my name at the top of your list)
This is the last time Im asking you why (This is the last time Im asking you why)
You break my heart in the blink of an eye (You break my heart)
This is the last time Im asking you, last time Im asking you
Last time Im asking you this
This is the last time Im asking you, last time Im asking you
Last time Im asking you this
This is the last time Im asking you, last time Im asking you
Last time Im asking you this
This is the last time Im asking you, last time Im asking you

State the obvious, I didnt get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So, go and tell your friends that Im obsessive and crazy
Thats fine, you wont mind if I say
By the way
I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
Youre a redneck heartbreak whos really bad at lyin
So, watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as Im concerned, youre just another picture to burn
Theres no time for tears, Im just sittin here planning my revenge
Theres nothing stoppin me from goin out with all of your best friends
And if you come around sayin sorry to me
My daddys gonna show ya how sorry youll be
Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
Youre a redneck heartbreak whos really bad at lyin
So, watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as Im concerned, youre just another picture to burn
And if youre missing me, youd better keep it to yourself
Cause coming back around here would be bad for your health

Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
Youre a redneck heartbreak whos really bad at lyin
So, watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
In case you havent heard
I really, really hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
Youre a redneck heartbreak whos really bad at lyin
So, watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as Im concerned, youre just another picture to burn
Burn, burn, burn, baby, burn
Youre just another picture to burn
Baby, burn31Embed
I guess you really did it this time
Left yourself in your war path
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind trying to get it back
Wasnt it easier in your lunchbox days?
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasnt it beautiful when you believed in everything
And everybody believed in you?
Its alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights are still bright to me, oh
Who you are is not where youve been
Youre still an innocent
Youre still an innocent
Did some things you cant speak of
But at night, you live it all again
You wouldnt be shattered on the floor now
If only you had seen what you know now then
Wasnt it easier in your firefly-catching days?
When everything out of reach
Someone bigger brought down to you
Wasnt it beautiful running wild til you fell asleep
Before the monsters caught up to you?

Its alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights are still bright to me, oh
Who you are is not where youve been
Youre still an innocent
Its okay, and life is a tough crowd
Thirty-two and still growing up now
Who you are is not what you did
Youre still an innocent
Time turns flames to embers
Youll have new Septembers
Every one of us has messed up, too, ooh
Minds change like the weather
I hope you remember
Today is never too late to be brand new, oh
Its alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me, oh
Who you are is not where youve been
Youre still an innocent
Its okay, and life is a tough crowd
Thirty-two and still growing up now
Who you are is not what you did
Youre still an innocent
Youre still an innocent
Lost your balance on a tightrope, oh
Its never too late to get it back31Embed
You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
Its the mornin of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you aint seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybodys way
Its your freshman year and youre gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hopin one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
You know, I havent seen you around before
Cause when youre fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
Youre gonna believe them
And when youre fifteen, feelin like theres nothin to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who youre gonna be
Fifteen
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough, youre best friends
Laughin at the other girls who think theyre so cool
Well be outta here as soon as we can
And then, youre on your very first date and hes got a car
And youre feelin like flyin
And your mamas waitin up and youre thinkin hes the one
And youre dancin round your room when the night ends
When the night ends

Cause when youre fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
Youre gonna believe them
And when youre fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin round
But in your life, youll do things greater than
Dating the boy on the football team
But I didnt know it at fifteen
When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had
To a boy who changed his mind
And we both cried
Cause when youre fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
Youre gonna believe them
And when youre fifteen, dont forget to look before you fall
Ive found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who youre supposed to be
I didnt know who I was supposed to be
At fifteen
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la
Your very first day
Take a deep breath, girl
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors43Embed
Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers silence makes me want to take the stairs
If you were here, wed laugh about their vacant stares
But right now, my time is theirs
Seems like theres always someone who disapproves
Theyll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jurys out, but my choice is you
So dont you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the waters rough
But this love is ours
You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I dont care, cause right now, youre mine
And youll say
Dont you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the waters rough
But this love is ours

And its not theirs to speculate if its wrong and
Your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong and
Ill fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you
Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos
Will be ignored, cause my heart is yours
So dont you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
Dont you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
But they cant take whats ours
They cant take whats ours
The stakes are high, the waters rough
But this love is ours20Embed
He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear and its like
I couldnt ask for anything better
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says you look beautiful tonight
And I feel perfectly fine
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And its 2AM and Im cursing your name
Youre so in love that you act insane
And thats the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
Its a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And thats the way I loved you
He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
Hes close to my mother
Talks business with my father
Hes charming and endearing
And Im comfortable

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
Its 2AM and Im cursing your name
Youre so in love that you acted insane
And thats the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
Its a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And thats the way I loved you
He cant see the smile Im faking
And my hearts not breaking
Cause Im not feeling anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating
Intoxicating, complicated
Got away by some mistake and now
I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
Its 2AM and Im cursing your name
Im so in love that I acted insane
And thats the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
Its a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And thats the way I loved you, oh, oh
And thats the way I loved you, oh, oh
Never knew I could feel that much
And thats the way I loved you16Embed
Long handwritten note deep in your pocket
Words, how little they mean when youre a little too late
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful theyll be and long they will wait
We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair
In dreams, I meet you in warm conversation
We both wake in lonely beds, different cities
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
And youve got your demons, and darling, they all look like me
Cause we had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair
Distance, timing
Breakdown, fighting
Silence, the train runs off its tracks
Kiss me, try to fix it
Could you just try to listen?
Hang up, give up
And for the life of us we cant get back

A beautiful, magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic
Beautiful, tragic, beautiful
What we had, a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic, love affair
We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair20Embed
Theres something bout the way
The street looks when its just rained
Theres a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot, yeah
Oh, yeah
Were driving down the road, I wonder if you know
Im trying so hard not to get caught up now
But youre just so cool, run your hands through your hair
Absentmindedly making me want you
And I dont know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I dont know why but with you, Id dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless
So, baby, drive slow til we run out of road
In this one horse town, I wanna stay right here
In this passengers seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now, capture it, remember it

Cause I dont know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I dont know why but with you, Id dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless
Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake, Im not usually this way but
You pull me in and Im a little more brave
Its the first kiss, its flawless, really something
Its fearless
Oh, yeah
Cause I dont know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I dont know why but with you, Id dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless
Cause I dont know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I dont know why but with you, Id dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

I bet this time of night, you’re still up
I bet you’re tired from a long hard week
I bet you’re sittin in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city, and I bet
Sometimes, you wonder bout me
And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don’t, I almost do, I almost do
I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
‘Cause each time you reach out, there’s no reply
I bet it never, ever occurred to you
That I can’t say hello to you and risk another goodbye
And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don’t, I almost do, I almost do

Oh, we made quite a mess, babe
It’s probably better off this way
And I confess, babe
In my dreams, you’re touching my face
And asking me if I want to try again with you
And I almost do
And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don’t, I almost do, I almost do
I bet this time of night, you’re still up
I bet you’re tired from a long hard week
I bet you’re sittin in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city, and I hope
Sometimes, you wonder bout me19Embed
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile, so he wont see
That I want and Im needing
Everything that we should be
Ill bet shes beautiful, that girl he talks about
And shes got everything that I have to live without
Drew talks to me
I laugh cause its just so funny
That I cant even see
Anyone when hes with me
He says hes so in love, hes finally got it right
I wonder if he knows hes all I think about at night
Hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishin on a wishing star
Hes the song in the car I keep singing, dont know why I do
Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I cant breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be

Shed better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know shes lucky cause
Hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishin on a wishing star
Hes the song in the car I keep singing, dont know why I do
So, Ill drive home alone as I turn off the light
Ill put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight
Cause hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one whos got enough of me to break my heart
Hes the song in the car I keep singing, dont know why I do
Hes the time taken up, but theres never enough
And hes all that I need to fall into
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile, so he wont see53Embed
I wish I could fly
Id pick you up and wed go back in time
Id write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night
And so it goes
Every weekend, this same party
I never go alone
And I dont seem broken-hearted
My friends all say they know
Everything Im going through
I drive down different roads
But they all lead back to you
Cause they dont know about the night in the hotel
They werent ridin in the car when we both fell
Didnt read the note on the Polaroid picture
They dont know how much I miss you
I wish I could fly
Id pick you up and wed go back in time
Id write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night

And so it was
We never saw it coming
Not trying to fall in love
But we did like children running
Back then, we didnt know
We were built to fall apart
We broke the status quo
Then we broke each others hearts
But dont forget about the night out in L.A
Dance in the kitchen, chase me down through the hallway
No one knows about the words that we whispered
No one knows how much I miss you
I wish I could fly
Id pick you up and wed go back in time
Id write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
To you, to you
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
To you, to you
I remember the night at the hotel
I was ridin in the car when we both fell
Im the one on the phone as you whisper
Do you know how much I miss you?
I wish that we could go back in time
And Id say to you
I miss you like it was the very first night
I wish I could fly
Id pick you up and wed go back in time
Id write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
To you, to you
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
To you, to you31Embed
I was ridin shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
Hes got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, Baby, is something wrong?
I say, Nothin, I was just thinkin
How we dont have a song
And he says
Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin out late, tapping on your window
When were on the phone and you talk real slow
Cause its late and your mama dont know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: Man, I didnt kiss her, and I should have
And when I got home, fore I said amen
Askin God if he could play it again
I was walking up the front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong or been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way
To my lovin bed
I almost didnt notice all the roses
And the note that said

Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin out late, tapping on your window
When were on the phone and you talk real slow
Cause its late and your mama dont know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: Man, I didnt kiss her, and I should have
And when I got home, fore I said amen
Askin God if he could play it again
Da-da-da-da
Ive heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for somethin to come along
That was as good as our song
Cause our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin out late, tappin on his window
When were on the phone and he talks real slow
Cause its late and his mama dont know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date: Man, I didnt kiss him, and I should have
And when I got home, fore I said amen
Askin God if he could play it again
Play it again, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah
I was ridin shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
And I wrote down our song36Embed
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
But I never thought Id live to see it break
Its getting dark and its all too quiet
And I cant trust anything now
And its coming over you like its all a big mistake
Woah, holding my breath
Wont lose you again
Somethings made your eyes go cold
Come on, come on, dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Somethings gone terribly wrong
Youre all I wanted
Come on, come on, dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Cant breathe whenever youre gone
Cant turn back now, Im haunted
Stood there and watched you walk away
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time, Im wishing he was you instead

Oh, holding my breath
Wont see you again
Something keeps me holding onto nothing
Come on, come on, dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Somethings gone terribly wrong
Youre all I wanted
Come on, come on, dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Cant breathe whenever youre gone
Cant turn back now, Im haunted
I know, I know
I just know
Youre not gone
You cant be gone, no
Come on, come on, dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Somethings gone terribly wrong
Wont finish what you started
Come on, come on, dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Cant breathe whenever youre gone
I cant go back, Im haunted
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Never ever thought Id see it break
Never thought Id see it46Embed
Want is the cigarette smoke on a jacket
You wore to the wrong part of town
Desire is the sound of the whiskey
Telling me you miss me, can you come around?
Passion is a passing thing
Its accidental chemistry
Lust is a liar, a short-lived fire
It aint what you and I are at all
Oh, its a need, its a need
I would go anywhere that you lead
I am hopeless, breathless, burning slow
Touch me, hold me, tell me, I wont let you go
I wont leave, its a need
Danger is a thousand prickles on my neck
That tell me to run or to freeze
Fear is the nightmare I had, you were with someone else
You forgot about me
Passion is a passing thing
Its accidental chemistry
Caught up in a feeling, it can be deceiving
This is like breathing for me

Oh, its a need, its a need
I would go anywhere that you lead
I am hopeless, breathless, burning slow
Touch me, hold me, tell me, I wont let you go
I wont leave, its a need
Baby, its always
A new kiss every time we do this
The truth is
Its essential to me
That you love me more than
Wishing, longing
Oh, its a need (Its a need), its a need (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
I would go (I would go) anywhere (Anywhere) that you lead (Oh, oh)
I am hopeless, breathless, burning slow (Burning slow)
Touch me, hold me, tell me, I wont let you go
I wont leave (I wont leave), its a need (Oh)2Embed
You said, I know
When I said, I need some time, need some space
To think about all of this
And you watched me go
And I knew my words were hard to hear
And harder to ever take back
And I said, When can I-I-I come back?
And you said, Thats when
When I wake up in the morning
Thats when, when its sunny or storming
Laughing, when Im crying
And thats when Ill be waiting at the front gate
Thats when, when I see your face
Ill let you in, and baby, thats when
Mm, mm
I said, I know
When you said, I did you wrong, made mistakes
And put you through all of this (Through all of this)
Then through the phone
Came all your tears
And I said, Leave those all in our past

And you said, When can I-I-I come back?
And I said, Thats when
When I wake up in the morning
Thats when, when its sunny or storming
Laughing, when Im crying
And thats when Ill be waiting at the front gate
Thats when, when I see your face
Ill let you in, and baby, thats when
And you said, Honestly
When you were gone
Did you ever think of me?
And I said
Thats when, when I woke up in the morning
Thats when it was sunny or storming
Laughing, when I was crying
And thats when you were waiting at the front gate
Thats when, when I saw your face
You let me in, and baby, thats when
Thats when, when I wake up in the morning (Yeah)
Thats when, when its sunny or storming
When Im laughing, when Im crying
(Thats when Ill be waiting at the front gate)
Thats when I miss you, thats when I want you
(Thats when, when I see your face)
Thats when I love you, thats when16Embed
He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, Thats a lie
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin stuck
On backroads at night
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone
But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
September saw a month of tears
And thankin God that you werent here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back
Its hard not to find it all a little bittersweet
And lookin back on all of that, its nice to believe

When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
And Im back for the first time since then
Im standin on your street
And theres a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that youll read
Is, When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday youll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
Oh, think of me, mmm
He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, Thats a lie25Embed
Hey, I knew Id run into you somewhere
Its been a while, I didnt mean to stare
I heard shes nothin like me
Im sure shell make you happy
But dont you, dont you
Smile at me and ask me how Ive been
Dont you say youve
Missed me if you dont want me again
You dont know how much I feel I love you still
So why dont you, dont you?
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Sometimes, I really wish that I could hate you
Ive tried, but thats just somethin I cant do
My heart knows what the truth is
I swore I wouldnt do this
But dont you, dont you
Smile at me and ask me how Ive been
Dont you say youve
Missed me if you dont want me again
You dont know how much I feel I love you still
So why dont you, dont you?

So Ill walk out of here tonight
Try to go on with my life
And you can say were still friends
(But I dont wanna pretend)
So if I see you again
Dont you (Dont you), dont you
Smile at me and ask me how Ive been
Dont you (Dont you) say youve
Missed me if you dont want me again
You dont (You dont) know how much I feel I love you still
So why dont you, dont you?

You said it in a simple way
4 a.m. the second day
How strange that I dont know you at all
Stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss, then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall
I told myself, dont get attached
But in my mind, I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you
And this is when the feeling sinks in
I dont wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess youre in New York today
I dont wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here
The delicate beginning rush
The feeling you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all
And now that I can put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never wouldve played so nonchalant

Taxi cabs and busy streets
That never bring you back to me
I cant help but wish you took me with you
And this is when the feeling sinks in
I dont wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess youre in London today
And I dont wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here
This is falling in love in the cruelest way
This is falling for you when you are worlds away
In New York, be here
But youre in London, and I break down
Cause its not fair that youre not around
This is when the feeling sinks in
I dont wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess youre in New York today
And I dont wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here
Oh-oh, oh-oh
I dont wanna miss you like this
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Come back, be here
Come back, be here20Embed
Say youre sorry, that face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
Cause I honestly believed in you
Holdin on, the days drag on
Stupid girl, I shoulda known, I shoulda known
That Im not a princess, this aint a fairytale
Im not the one youll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This aint Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now its too late for you and your white horse
To come around
Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake, I didnt know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, now I know
That Im not a princess, this aint a fairytale
Im not the one youll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This aint Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now its too late for you and your white horse
To come around

And there you are on your knees
Beggin for forgiveness, beggin for me
Just like I always wanted
But Im so sorry
Cause Im not your princess, this aint our fairytale
Im gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now
And its too late for you and your white horse
Now its too late for you and your white horse
To catch me now
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Try and catch me now, oh
Its too late to catch me now41Embed
We used to walk along the streets
When the porch lights were shining bright
Before I had somewhere to be
Back when we had all night and we were happy
I do recall a good while back, we snuck into the circus
You threw your arms around my neck, back when I deserved it
And we were happy
When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed em all up
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
Talking bout your daddys farm we were gonna buy someday
And we were happy
We used to watch the sun go down on the boats in the water
Thats sorta how I feel right now
And goodbyes so much harder cause we were happy
When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed em all up
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
Talking bout your daddys farm we were gonna buy someday
And we were happy
We were happy

Oh, I hate those voices telling me Im not in love anymore
But they dont give me choices and thats what these tears are for
Cause we were happy
We were happy
When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed em all up
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
Talking bout your daddys farm
And you were gonna marry me
And we were happy
We were happy
Oh-oh-oh-oh
We were happy18Embed
What about your promises, promises?
What about your promises, promises, promises? (No)
What a shame
Didnt wanna be the one that got away, yeah
Big mistake, you broke the sweetest promise
That you never should have made
Im here on the kitchen floor
You call, but I wont hear it
You said, No one else
How could you do this, babe? (What about your promises, promises?)

Were a wreck, youre the wrecking ball
We said, No one else
How could you do this, babe? (What about your promises, promises?)
You really blew this, babe

I said, Oh, my, what a marvelous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like were made of starlight
Like were made of starlight
I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of 45
Picked me up, late one night out the window
We were 17 and crazy, running wild, wild
Cant remember what song it was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince
And I said, Oh, my, what a marvelous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like were made of starlight, starlight
Like were made of starlight, starlight
He said, “Look at you, worrying too much about things you cant change
Youll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me
Dont you see the starlight, starlight?
Dont you dream impossible things?

Like, Oh, my, what a marvelous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like were made of starlight, starlight
Like were made of starlight, starlight
Ooh-ooh, hes talking crazy
Ooh-ooh, dancing with me
Ooh-ooh, we could get married
Have ten kids and teach em how to dream

Oh, my, what a marvelous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like were made of starlight, starlight
Like were made of starlight, starlight
Like were made of starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Like starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Dont you see the starlight, starlight?
Dont you dream impossible things?26Embed
Your little hands wrapped around my finger
And its so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter cause youre dreaming
So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite nightlight
To you, everythings funny
You got nothing to regret
Id give all I have, honey
If you could stay like that
Oh, darling, dont you ever grow up
Dont you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh, darling, dont you ever grow up
Dont you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
I wont let nobody hurt you
Wont let no one break your heart
And no one will desert you
Just try to never grow up
Never grow up
Youre in the car on the way to the movies
And youre mortified your moms dropping you off
At fourteen, theres just so much you cant do
And you cant wait to move out someday and call your own shots
But dont make her drop you off around the block
Remember that shes getting older, too
And dont lose the way that you dance around
In your PJs getting ready for school

Oh, darling, dont you ever grow up
Dont you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh, darling, dont you ever grow up
Dont you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
No ones ever burned you
Nothings ever left you scarred
And even though you want to
Just try to never grow up
Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
And all your little brothers favorite songs
I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone
So here I am in my new apartment
In a big city, they just dropped me off
Its so much colder than I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on
Wish Id never grown up
I wish Id never grown up
Oh, I dont wanna grow up
Wish Id never grown up, I could still be little
Oh, I dont wanna grow up
Wish Id never grown up, it could still be simple
Oh, darling, dont you ever grow up
Dont you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh, darling, dont you ever grow up
Dont you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
Wont let nobody hurt you
Wont let no one break your heart
And even though you want to
Please try to never grow up
Oh, oh
Dont you ever grow up
Oh (Never grow up), just never grow up24Embed
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely bargin in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearin a gown shaped like a pastry
This is surely not what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say
Dont say yes, run away now
Ill meet you when youre out
Of the church, at the back door
Dont wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, Speak now
Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be

She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me
You wish it was me, dont you?
Dont say yes, run away now
Ill meet you when youre out
Of the church, at the back door
Dont wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, Speak now
Dont say yes, run away now (Run away now)
Ill meet you when youre out
Of the church, at the back door
Dont wait or say a single vow (Say a single vow)
Your time is running out
And they said, Speak now
Ooh (Run away now), la
Ooh (Say a single vow), ooh
I hear the preacher say
Speak now or forever hold your peace
Theres the silence, theres my last chance
I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But Im only lookin at you
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely bargin in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl, haha
So, dont say yes, run away now
Ill meet you when youre out
Of the church, at the back door
Dont wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
They said, Speak now
And you say, Lets run away now (Run away now)
Ill meet you when Im out
Of my tux, at the back door
Baby, I didnt say my vows (Say a single vow)
So glad you were around
When they said, Speak now41Embed
It wasnt just like a movie
The rain didnt soak through my clothes, down to my skin
Im drivin away and I, I guess you could say
This is the last time Ill drive this way again
Lost in the gray and I try to grab at the fray
Cause I, I still love you but I cant
Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye, baby
I want you bad but its come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
Cause you took me home but you just couldnt keep me
Bye bye, baby
Bye bye, baby
The picture frame is empty
On the dresser, vacant just like me
I see your writing on the dash
Then back to your hesitation
I was so sure of everything
Everything I thought wed always have
Guess I never doubted it
Then the here and the now floods in
Feels like Im becoming a part of your past

Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye, baby
I want you bad but its come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
Cause you took me home but you just couldnt keep me
Bye bye, baby
And theres so much that I cant touch
Youre all I want but its not enough this time
And all the pages are just slipping through my hands
And Im so scared of how this ends
Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye, baby
I want you bad but its come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
Cause you took me home but you just couldnt keep me
Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye, baby
I want you bad but its come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
Cause you took me home but you just couldnt keep me
Oh, you took me home, I thought you were gonna keep me
Bye bye, baby
Bye bye, baby10Embed
Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I dont feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please, tell me
Cause one second, it was perfect
Now youre halfway out the door
And I stare at the phone, he still hasnt called
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, Forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
Cause I was there when you said, Forever and always
Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now Im not so sure
So heres to everything coming down to nothing
Heres to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I dont anymore

And I stare at the phone, he still hasnt called
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, Forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
Cause I was there when you said, Forever and always
You didnt mean it, baby, I dont think so
Oh, back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
Cause I was there when you said, Forever and always
Oh, I stare at the phone, he still hasnt called
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when we said, Forever and always
And it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
Cause I was there when you said, Forever and always
You didnt mean it, baby
You said, Forever and always, yeah14Embed
Follow me home if you dare to
I wouldnt know where to lead you
Should I take chances when no one took chances on me?
So I watch from the dark, wait for my life to start
With no beauty in my memory
All that I wanted was to be wanted
Too young to wander London streets, alone and haunted
Born into nothing
At least you have something, something to cling to
Visions of dazzling rooms Ill never get let into
And the memories were lost long ago
But at least you have beautiful ghosts
Perilous night, their voices calling
A flicker of light before the dawning
Out here, the wild ones are taming the fear within me
Scared to call them my friends and be broken again
Is this hope just a mystical dream?
All that I wanted was to be wanted
Too young to wander London streets, alone and haunted
Born into nothing
At least you have something, something to cling to
Visions of dazzling rooms Ill never get let into
And the memories were lost long ago
But at least you have beautiful ghosts

And so maybe my home isnt what I had known
What I thought it would be
But I feel so alive with these phantoms of night
And I know that this life isnt safe, but its wild and its free
All that I wanted was to be wanted
Ill never wander London streets, alone and haunted
Born into nothing
With them, I have something, something to cling to
I never knew Id love this world theyve let me into
And the memories were lost long ago
So Ill dance with these beautiful ghosts
And the memories were lost long ago
So Ill dance with these beautiful ghosts12Embed
Im pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room, at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn away
But you stayed
This morning, I said we should talk about it
Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
Thats when you came in wearing a football helmet
And said, Okay, lets talk
And I said
Stay, stay, stay
Ive been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that its funny when Im mad, mad, mad
But I think that its best if we both stay
Before you, Id only dated self-indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now, Im always laughing
And I love you because you have given me
No choice but to
Stay, stay, stay
Ive been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that its funny when Im mad, mad, mad
But I think that its best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay

You took the time to memorize me
My fears, my hopes, and dreams
I just like hanging out with you all the time
All those times that you didnt leave, its been occurring to me
Id like to hang out with you for my whole life
Stay and Ill be loving you for quite some time
No one else is gonna love me when I get mad, mad, mad
So I think that its best if we both stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay!
Stay, stay, stay
Ive been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that its funny when Im mad, mad, mad
But I think that its best if we both stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay!
Stay, stay, stay
Ive been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that its funny when Im mad, mad, mad
But I think that its best if we both stay

My winter nights are taken up by static
Stress and holiday shopping traffic
But I close my eyes and Im somewhere else
Just like magic
In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
Where the people would come
To dance under sparkling lights
Bundled up in their mittens and coats
And the cider would flow
And I just wanna be there tonight
Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everythin is icy and blue
And you would be there too
Under the mistletoe
Watchin the fire glow
And tellin me, I love you
Just bein in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true

In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
Theres a light in the barn
We run inside out from the cold
In the town, kids are dreamin of sleighs
And theyre warm and theyre safe
They wake to see a blanket of snow
Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everythin is icy and blue
And you would be there too
Under the mistletoe
Watchin the fire glow
And tellin me, I love you
Just bein in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true
Baby, yeah
And when Im feelin alone
You remind me of home
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
And when the world isnt fair
I pretend that were there
Baby, baby, Merry Christmas (To you)
Under the mistletoe (To you)
Watching the fire glow
And tellin me, I love you
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas (Darling)
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
I love you
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas (I just want you to know)
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Where every wish comes true
I love you16Embed
I see your face in my mind as I drive away
Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
People are people and sometimes, we change our minds
But its killing me to see you go after all this time
Music starts playing like the end of a sad movie
Its the kind of ending you dont really wanna see
Cause its tragedy and itll only bring you down
Now, I dont know what to be without you around
And we know its never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
Youre the only thing I know like the back of my hand
And I cant breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to
Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
Every little bump in the road, I tried to swerve
But people are people and sometimes, it doesnt work out
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out

And we know its never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
Youre the only thing I know like the back of my hand
And I cant breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you but I have to
Its 2 A.M, feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know its not easy, easy for me
Its 2 A.M, feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know this aint easy, easy for me
And we know its never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me, oh-oh
I cant breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to
Im sorry, Im sorry (Mmm)
Im sorry, (Yeah, yeah) Im sorry
Im sorry, Im sorry
Im sorry18Embed
I remember you bare feet, down the hallway
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs
I love you to the moon and back
I remember your blue eyes looking into mine
Like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing before bed time
Then jumping on me waking me up
I can still feel you hold my hand, little man
And even the moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you
Come on, baby, with me
Were going to fly away from here
You were my best four years
I remember the drive home
When the blind hope turned to crying and screaming, Why?
Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say
About a beautiful boy who died
And its about to be Halloween
You could be anything you wanted, if you were still here
I remember the last day, when I kissed your face
And whispered in your ear

Come on, baby, with me
Were going to fly away from here
Out of this curtained room and this hospital grey
Well just disappear
Come on, baby, with me
Were going to fly away from here
You were my best four years
What if Im standing in your closet trying to talk to you?
And what if I kept the hand-me-downs you wont grow into?
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?
What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you?
Come on, baby, with me
Were going to fly away from here
Come on, baby, with me
Were going to fly away from here
You were my best four years
I remember you bare feet, down the hallway
I love you to the moon and back18Embed
Loving him is like
Driving a new Maserati down a dead end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like
Trying to change your mind once youre already flying through the freefall
Like the colors in autumn
So bright, just before they lose it all
Losing him was blue like Id never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody youve never met
But loving him was red
Loving him was red
Touching him was like
Realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as
Easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like
Trying to solve a crossword and realizing theres no right answer
Regretting him was like
Wishing you never found out that love could be that strong

Losing him was blue like Id never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody youve never met
But loving him was red
Oh, red
Burning red
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself its time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Burning, it was red
Losing him was blue like Id never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
Cause loving him was red
Yeah, yeah, red
Were burning red
And thats why hes spinning round in my head
Burning red, burning red
His love was like
Driving a new Maserati down a dead end streetEmbed
Im five years old, its getting cold, Ive got my big coat on
I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
Look now, the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home
I dont know why all the trees change in the fall
But I know youre not scared of anything at all
Dont know if Snow Whites house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today
Im thirteen now
And dont know how my friends could be so mean
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop til Ive forgotten all their names
I dont know who Im going to talk to now at school
But I know Im laughing on the car ride home with you
Dont know how long its going to take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today

I have an excellent father, his strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother, inside and out
Hes better than I am
I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run
And I had the best days with you
There is a video I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and youre talking to me
Its the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs
And Daddys smart
And youre the prettiest lady in the whole wide world
And now I know why all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes
For staying back and watching me shine
And I didnt know if you knew, so Im taking this chance to say
That I had the best day with you today17Embed

Last night, I heard my own heart beating
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Six months gone and Im still reaching
Even though I know youre not there
I was playing back a thousand memories, baby
Thinking bout everything weve been through
Maybe Ive been going back too much lately
When time stood still and I had you
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said youre sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie, youd be here by now
I know people change and these things happen
But I remember how it was back then
Wrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughin
Cause nothing like this ever happened to them
Now Im pacing down the hall, chasing down your street
Flashback to the night when you said to me
That nothings gonna change, not for me and you
Back before I knew how much I had to lose

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said youre sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie, youd be here by now
If youre out there, if youre somewhere, if youre moving on
Ive been waiting for you ever since youve been gone
I just want it back the way it was before
And I just wanna see you back at my front door
And I say, Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would before you said its not that easy
Before the fight, before I locked you out
But I take it all back now
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said youre sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie, youd be here by now
Youd be here by now
Its not the kind of ending you wanna see now
Baby, what about the ending?
Oh, I thought youd be here by now
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Thought youd be here by now22Embed
Mmm-mm, mm-mm
Mmm-mm, mm-mm
Mmm-mm, mm-mm, yeah
Hey, Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked, we were talking
I didnt say half the things I wanted to
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
Ill be the one waiting there even when its cold
Hey, Stephen, boy, you might have me believing
I dont always have to be alone
Cause I cant help it if you look like an angel
Cant help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic Ive been feeling since I met you
Cant help it if theres no one else
Mmm, I cant help myself
Hey, Stephen, Ive been holding back this feeling
So I got some things to say to you, ha
Ive seen it all, so I thought
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do
The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
Its beautiful, wonderful, dont you ever change
Hey, Stephen, why are people always leaving?
I think you and I should stay the same

Cause I cant help it if you look like an angel
Cant help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic Ive been feeling since I met you
Cant help it if theres no one else
Mmm, I cant help myself
Theyre dimming the street lights, youre perfect for me
Why arent you here tonight?
Im waiting alone now, so come on and come out
And pull me near and shine, shine, shine
Hey, Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose
All those other girls, well, theyre beautiful
But would they write a song for you? (Ha-ha)
I cant help it if you look like an angel
Cant help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic Ive been feeling since I met you
Cant help it if theres no one else
Mmm, I cant help myself
If you look like an angel
Cant help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic Ive been feeling since I met you
Cant help it if theres no one else
Mmm, I cant help myself
Myself
Cant help myself
I cant help myself37Embed
Its strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
Yesterday, I found out about you
Even now, just lookin at you feels wrong
You say that youd take it all back
Given one chance
It was a moment of weakness
And you said yes
You shouldve said no, you shouldve gone home
You shouldve thought twice fore you let it all go
You shouldve known that word
Bout what you did with herd get back to me (Get back to me)
And I shouldve been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldnt be asking myself why
You shouldnt be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You shouldve said no
Baby, and you might still have me
You can see that Ive been cryin
And baby, you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?

You say that the past is the past
You need one chance
It was a moment of weakness
And you said yes
You shouldve said no, you shouldve gone home
You shouldve thought twice fore you let it all go
You shouldve known that word
Bout what you did with her’d get back to me (Get back to me)
And I shouldve been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldnt be asking myself why
You shouldnt be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You shouldve said no
Baby, and you might still have me
Oh, oh
I cant resist
Before you go, tell me this
Was it worth it?
Was she worth this?
No, no
No, no, no, no
You shouldve said no, you shouldve gone home
You shouldve thought twice fore you let it all go
You shouldve known that word
Bout what you did with her’d get back to me (Get back to me)
And I shouldve been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldnt be asking myself why
You shouldnt be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You shouldve said no
Baby, and you might still have me29Embed
You have a way of coming easily to me
And when you take, you take the very best of me
So I start a fight cause I need to feel something
And you do what you want cause Im not what you wanted
Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Just walk away, aint no use defending words that you will never say
And now that Im sitting here thinking it through
Ive never been anywhere cold as you
You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
And I stood there loving you and wished them all away
And you come away with a great little story
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you
Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
So just walk away, aint no use defending words that you will never say
And now that Im sitting here thinking it through
Ive never been anywhere cold as you
You never did give a damn thing, honey, but I cried, cried for you
And I know you wouldnt have told nobody if I died, died for you
(Died for you)

Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Every smile you fake is so condescending
Counting all the scars you made
And now that Im sitting here thinking it through
Ive never been anywhere cold as you

The first shots fired, everybodys gathered around
Youre looking at me like I tried to take you down
No, no, thats not what happened at all
Theres no sound, Im waiting on your next move
A showdown and I know where to hit you
But no, no, its not how I wanted this to go down
Now were standing in the ring
And you make the first swing
And now were fighting dirty
Wont somebody come say, Break it up?
And I used to be on your side
Now its looking like were going to battle
And why you taking shots at me like
Somebodys gonna give you a medal?
And I never wanna hurt you
But Im tired of taking all these blows
And so Id rather be on your side
But if you wanna fight
Baby, lets go, oh, oh
Lets go, oh, oh

So gloves off, if this is how you want it
We had it all, but you couldnt keep a promise
No, no, Im not the one who tore us apart
Let me remind you for a minute why were not fine
Is she here? Is she standing on the sidelines?
Oh, oh, cant you tell this is breaking my heart?
Now were standing in the ring
And you make the first swing
And now Im fighting dirty
But I aint going down ‘til they break it up
And I used to be on your side
Now its looking like were going to battle
And why you taking shots at me like
Somebodys gonna give you a medal?
And I never wanna hurt you
But Im tired of taking all these blows
And so Id rather be on your side
But if you wanna fight
Lets go, oh, oh
Lets go, oh, oh
Now were standing in the ring
Breaking everything that weve been building up so long
And I dont wanna do this, break it up
But youre not who I thought you were
And this is looking more like a war
Looks like were going to war
And I used to be on your side
Now its looking like were going to battle
And Im trying not to break down crying
No ones gonna give you a medal
And I never wanna hurt you
But Im tired of taking all these blows
And so Id rather be on your side
Id rather be on your side
But if you wanna fight
Baby, lets go, oh, oh
Looks like were going to war
Oh, oh
The first shots fired, everybodys gathered around
Youre looking at me like I tried to take you down
No, no, but if you wanna fight, baby, lets go4Embed

She said I was seven and you were nine
I looked at you like the stars that shined
In the sky, the pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
Growing up and falling in love
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
And said, Oh, my, my, my
Take me back to the house in the backyard tree
Said youd beat me up, you were bigger than me
You never did, you never did
Take me back when our world was one block wide
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
Just two kids, you and I
Oh, my, my, my, my
Well, I was sixteen when suddenly
I wasnt that little girl you used to see
But your eyes still shined like pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
They never believed wed really fall in love
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
And said, Oh, my, my, my

Take me back to the creek beds we turned up
2 a.m. riding in your truck
And all I need is you next to me
Take me back to the time we had our very first fight
The slamming of doors stead of kissing goodnight
You stayed outside til the morning light
Oh, my, my, my, my
A few years had gone and come around
We were sitting at our favorite spot in town
And you looked at me, got down on one knee
Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
Our whole town came and our mamas cried
You said, I do, and I did, too
Take me home where we met so many years before
Well rock our babies on that very front porch
After all this time, you and I
And Ill be eighty-seven, youll be eighty-nine
Ill still look at you like the stars that shine
In the sky, oh, my, my, my15Embed
Dont look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Dont look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
I dont even know her
But I feel a responsibility
To do whats upstanding and right
Its kinda like a code, yeah
And youve been getting closer and closer
And crossing so many lines
And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
But, honey, I am no ones exception
This, I have previously learned
So dont look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Dont look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now youve got me alone, and I say
Dont look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that

I just want to make sure
You understand perfectly
Youre the kind of man who makes me sad
While she waits up
You chase down the newest thing
And take for granted what you have
And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
And, yeah, I might go with it
If I hadnt once been just like her
So dont look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Dont look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now youve got me alone, and I say
Dont look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Call a cab, lose my number
Youre about to lose your girl
Call a cab, lose my number
Lets consider this lesson learned
Dont look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Dont look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
Want to see you pick up your phone
And tell her youre coming home
Dont look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
Dont look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
It would be a fine proposition
If I hadnt once been just like her17Embed
All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around
Ive been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down
And its taken me this long, baby, but Ive figured you out
And youre thinking well be fine again, but not this time around
You dont have to call anymore
I wont pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Dont wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that youre sorry
But I dont believe you, baby, like I did before
Youre not sorry (No, no, no, no)
Youre looking so innocent, I might believe you if I didnt know
Couldve loved you all my life if you hadnt left me waiting in the cold
And youve got your share of secrets
And Im tired of being last to know, oh
And now youre asking me to listen cause its worked each time before
But you dont have to call anymore
I wont pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Dont wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that youre sorry
But I dont believe you, baby, like I did before
Youre not sorry (No, no, no, no)
Youre not sorry (No, no, no, no)

You had me crawling for you, honey, and it never wouldve gone away, no
You used to shine so bright, but I watched all of it fade
So you dont have to call anymore
I wont pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Theres nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that youre sorry
But I dont believe you, baby, like I did before
Youre not sorry (No, no, no, no)
Youre not sorry (No, no, no, no)
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
Woah, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

Im so glad you made time to see me
Hows life, tell me, hows your family
I havent seen them in a while
Youve been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why
Cause the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying Im sorry for that night
And Id go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain’t nothing but missing you
Wishing Id realized what I had when you were mine
Id go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time
These days I havent been sleeping
Staying up playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didnt call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side and
Realized I loved you in the fall

And then the cold came, the dark days
When fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying Im sorry for that night
And Id go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain’t nothing but missing you
Wishing Id realized what I had when you were mine
Id go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time
I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile, so good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again I swear Id love you right
Id go back in time and change it, but I cant
So if the chain is on your door, I understand...
And then he said, Its too late to apologize
Its too late...
He said, Its too late to apologize
Its too late...
So this is me swallowing my pride (Its too late to apologize)
Standing in front of you, saying Im sorry for that night (Its too late...)
And I go back to December (Its too late to apologize, its too late)
It turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you (Its too late to apologize)
Wishing Id realized what I had when you were mine (Its too late...)
Oh...
He said youre not sorry (no no no)
Youre not sorry (no no no)
Youre not sorry (no no no)
Youre not sorry (no, no, no...)1Embed
Untouchable like a distant diamond sky
Im reaching out and I just cant tell you why
Im caught up in you, Im caught up in you
Untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And when youre close, I feel like coming undone
In the middle of the night when Im in this dream
Its like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that well be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven
Its half full and I wont wait here all day
I know youre saying that youd be here anyway
But youre untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And now that youre close, I feel like coming undone
In the middle of the night when Im in this dream
Its like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that well be together
Come on, come on, oh
In the middle of the night waking from this dream
I want to feel you by my side, standing next to me
You got to come on, come on, say that well be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven

Im caught up in you
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
But youre untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
Now that youre close, I feel like coming undone
In the middle of the night when Im in this dream
Its like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that well be together
Come on, come on, oh-oh-oh

Its like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that well be together

I want to feel you by my side, standing next to me
You got to come on, come on, say that well be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven

Im walkin fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love til it hurts or bleeds
Or fades in time
And I never (Never)
Saw you comin
And Ill never (Never)
Be the same
You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now all we know is dont let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes
So you were never a saint and I loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain, mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild

And I never (Never)
Saw you comin
And Ill never (Never)
Be the same
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
Youre my Achilles heel
This is the golden age
Of something good and right and real
And I never (Never)
Saw you comin
And Ill never
Be the same, oh
And I never (Never)
Saw you comin
And Ill never (Never)
(So you were never a saint and I loved in shades of wrong)
Be the same (We learn to live with the pain, mosaic broken hearts)
(But this love is brave and wild)
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right25Embed
Seems the only one who doesnt see your beauty
Is the face in the mirror looking back at you
You walk around here thinking youre not pretty
But thats not true
Cause I know you
Hold on, baby, youre losing it
The waters high, youre jumping into it and letting go
And no one knows
That you cry, but you dont tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And youre tied together with a smile
But youre coming undone, oh
I guess its true that love was all you wanted
Cause youre giving it away like its extra change
Hoping it will end up in his pocket (Pocket)
But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
Oh, cause its not his price to pay
Its not his price to pay
Hold on, baby, youre losing it
The waters high, youre jumping into it and letting go
And no one knows
That you cry, but you dont tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And youre tied together with a smile
But youre coming undone, oh
Oh, oh

Hold on, baby, youre losing it
The waters high, youre jumping into it and letting go
And no one knows
That you cry but you dont tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And youre tied together with a smile
But youre coming undone, oh
Youre tied together with a smile
But youre coming undone, oh, oh-oh
Goodbye, baby
With a smile, baby, baby

He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear
And its like I couldnt ask for anything better
He opens up my door, and I get into his car
And he says, You look beautiful tonight
And I feel perfectly fine
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And its 2AM and Im cursing your name
Youre so in love that you act insane
And thats the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
Its a rollercoaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And thats the way I loved you
He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
Hes close to my mother
Talks business with my father
Hes charming and endearing
And Im comfortable

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And its 2AM and Im cursing your name
Youre so in love that you act insane
And thats the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
Its a rollercoaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And thats the way I loved you
He cant see the smile Im faking
And my hearts not breaking
Cause Im not feeling anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating
Intoxicating, complicated
Got away by some mistake, and now
I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
Its 2AM and Im cursing your name
So in love that I acted insane
And thats the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
Its a rollercoaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And thats the way I loved you oh, oh
Woah, woah, oh-oh, oh
And thats the way I loved you, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, woah
Never knew I could feel that much
And thats the way I loved you13Embed
In the heat of the fight, I walked away
Ignoring words that you were saying
Tryin to make me stay
I said, This time Ive had enough
And youve called a hundred times
But Im not picking up
Cause Im so mad
I might tell you that its over
But if you look a little closer
I said, Leave, but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, Im in love with you
Wait there in the pouring rain, coming back for more
And dont you leave, cause I know all I need is on
The other side of the door
Me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone
Going through the photographs, staring at the phone
I keep going back over things we both said
And I remember the slamming door
And all the things that I misread

So, babe, if you know everything
Tell me why you couldnt see
When I left, I wanted you to chase after me, yeah
I said, Leave, but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, Im in love with you
Wait there in the pouring rain, coming back for more
And dont you leave, cause I know all I need is on
The other side of the door
And Ill scream out the window
I cant even look at you
I dont need you, but I do, I do, I do
Ill say, Theres nothing you can say
To make this right again, I mean it, I mean it
What I mean is
I said, Leave, but, baby, all I want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, Im in love with you
Wait there in the pouring rain, coming back for more
And dont you leave, cause I know all I need is on
The other side of the door
With your face and the beautiful eyes
And the conversation with the little white lies
And the faded picture of a beautiful night
You carried me from your car up the stairs
And I broke down crying, was she worth this mess?
After everything and that little black dress
After everything, I must confess, I need you11Embed
I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sisters house
And youve still got it in your drawer, even now
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
Were singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know its long gone and
That magics not here no more
And I might be okay, but Im not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh
Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red cause you were lookin over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mothers telling stories bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me bout your past, thinking your future was me

And I know its long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to
Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
Were dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well, yeah
And maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
Til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again
Just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
Im a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
Cause I remember it all, all, all
Too well
Time wont fly, its like Im paralyzed by it
Id like to be my old self again, but Im still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You cant get rid of it
Cause you remember it all too well, yeah
Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing youve ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well18Embed
Theres something bout the way
The street looks when its just rained
Theres a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot, yeah
Oh, yeah
Were driving down the road, I wonder if you know
Im trying so hard not to get caught up now
But youre just so cool, run your hands through your hair
Absent-mindedly making me want you
And I dont know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I dont know why but with you Id dance
In a storm in my best dress, fеarless
So, baby, drive slow til we run out of road in this onе-horse town
I wanna stay right here, in this passengers seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now, capture it, remember it

Cause I dont know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I dont know why but with you Id dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless
Oh, oh
Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake, Im not usually this way but
You pull me in and Im a little more brave
Its the first kiss, its flawless, really something
Its fearless
Oh, yeah
Cause I dont know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I dont know why but with you Id dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless
Cause I dont know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I dont know why but with you Id dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless
Oh, oh
Oh-oh, yeah21Embed
Friday night beneath the stars
In a field behind your yard
You and I are painting pictures in the sky
And sometimes, we dont say a thing
Just listen to the crickets sing
Everything I need is right here by my side
And I know everything about you
I dont wanna live without you
Im only up when youre not down
Dont wanna fly if youre still on the ground
Its like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half, Im only tryin to
Let you know that what I feel is true
And Im only me when Im with you
Just a small-town boy and girl
Livin in a crazy world
Tryna figure out what is and isnt true
And I dont try to hide my tears
My secrets or my deepest fears
Through it all, nobody gets me like you do

And you know everything about me
You say that you cant live without me
Im only up when youre not down
Dont wanna fly if youre still on the ground
Its like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half, Im only tryin to
Let you know that what I feel is true
And Im only me when Im with you
When Im with anybody else
Its so hard to be myself
And only you can tell
That Im only up when youre not down
Dont wanna fly if youre still on the ground
Its like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half, Im only tryin to
Let you know that what I feel is true
And Im only me
Who I wanna be
Well, Im only me when Im with you
With you
Uh-huh-huh, yeah10Embed
And its a sad picture, the final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
You know its all the same, another time and place
Repeating history and youre getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And Ill do anything to see it through
Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And well sing hallelujah, well sing hallelujah
Oh, oh
So, weve been outnumbered, raided, and now cornered
Its hard to fight when the fight ain’t fair
Were getting stronger now, find things they never found
They might be bigger but were faster and never scared
You can walk away, say we dont need this
But theres something in your eyes says we can beat this
Cause these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And well sing hallelujah, well sing hallelujah
Oh, oh

Tonight, we stand, get off our knees
Fight for what weve worked for all these years
And the battle was long, its the fight of our lives
But well stand up champions tonight
It was the night things changed
Can you see it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
Its a revolution, throw your hands up
Cause we never gave in
And well sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah
Hallelujah23Embed

Put your lips close to mine
As long as they dont touch
Out of focus, eye to eye
Til the gravitys too much
And Ill do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And Id be smart to walk away
But youre quicksand
This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I-I-I like it
I cant decide if its a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
All we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow
But youre friction

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
I-I-I like it
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you a, get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I would follow you, follow you home
Ill follow you, follow you home
This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous
I-I-I, I-I-I, I-I-I—
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you a, get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I will follow you, follow you home
Ill follow you, follow you home
Ill follow you, follow you home
Ill follow you, follow you home
This slope is treacherous
I-I-I like it24Embed
Do you remember
The 28th night of September?
Love was changin the minds of pretenders
While chasin the clouds away
Our hearts were ringin
In the key that our souls were singin
As we danced in the night, remember
How the stars stole the night away
Ahh-ahh-ahh
Hey, say that you remember
Ai, ai, dancin in September
Ai, ai, never was a cloudy day
My thoughts are with you
Holding hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love
Remember how we knew love was here to stay
Now, December found the love that we shared in September
Only blue talk and love
Remember the love that we share today
Ahh-ahh-ahh
Hey, say that you remember
Ai, ai, dancin in September
Ai, ai, never was a cloudy day

Id never gone with the wind, just let it flow
Let it take me where it wants to go
Til you open the door, theres so much more
Id never seen it before
I was tryin to fly but I couldnt find wings
But you came along and you changed everything
You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like Im fallin and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier
Ive watched from a distance as you made life your own
Every sky was your own kind of blue
And I wanted to know how that would feel
And you made it so real
You showed me somethin that I couldnt see
You opened my eyes
And you made me believe
You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like Im fallin and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier, oh

Baby, you showed me what livin is for
I dont wanna hide anymore
Oh-oh
You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like Im fallin and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier
Crazier, crazier7Embed

I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that Im obsessive and crazy

Tall, dark, and superman
He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
To save the world or go to work
Its the same thing to me
Hes got his mothers eyes, his fathers ambition
I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
I hang on every word you say, yay
And you smile and say, How are you?”
I say, Just fine
I always forget to tell you, I love you
I love you forever
I watch superman fly away
Youve got a busy day today
Go save the world, Ill be around
I watch superman fly away
Come back, Ill be with you someday
Ill be right here on the ground
When you come back down
Tall, dark and beautiful
Hes complicated, hes irrational
But I hope someday youll take me away and save the day, yeah
Something in his deep brown eyes has me sayin
Hes not all bad like his reputation
And I cant hear one single word they say
And youll leave, got places to be and Ill be okay
I always forget to tell you I love you
I loved you from the very first day

I watch superman fly away
Youve got a busy day today
Go save the world, Ill be around
I watch superman fly away
Come back, Ill be with you someday
Ill be right here on the ground
When you come back down
And I watch you fly around the world
And I hope you dont save some other girl
Dont forget, dont forget about me
Im far away, but I never let you go
Im love-struck and looking out the window
Dont forget, dont forget where Ill be
Right here, wishing the flowers were from you
Wishing the card was from you
Wishing the call was from you
Cause I loved you from the very first day
I watch superman fly away
Youve got a busy day today
Go save the world, Ill be around
Forever and ever here
I watch superman fly away
I swear, Ill be with you someday
Ill be right here on the ground
When you come back down
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
When you come back down13Embed
Coreys eyes are like a jungle
He smiles, its like the radio
He whispers songs into my window
In words that nobody knows
Theres pretty girls on every corner
They watch him as hes walking home
Saying, Does he know?
Will you ever know?
Youre beautiful, every little piece, love
Dont you know youre really gonna be someone?
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my door
Oh, but if it dont
Stay beautiful
Cory finds another way to be
The highlight of my day
Im taking pictures in my mind
So I can save em for a rainy day
Its hard to make a conversation
When hes taking my breath away
I should say, Hey, by the way

Youre beautiful, every little piece, love
Dont you know youre really gonna be someone?
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my door
Oh, but if it dont
Stay beautiful
If you and I are a story
That never gets told
If what you are is a daydream
Ill never get to hold, at least youll know
Youre beautiful, every little piece, love
Dont you know youre really gonna be someone?
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my front door
Oh, but if it dont
Will you stay beautiful, beautiful, beautiful?
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
La-la-la
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, but if it dont
Stay beautiful, stay beautiful

Youre on the phone with your girlfriend, shes upset
Shes going off about something that you said
Cause she doesnt get your humor like I do
Im in my room, its a typical Tuesday night
Im listening to the kind of music she doesnt like
And shell never know your story like I do
Cause she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
Shes Cheer Captain and Im on the bleachers
Dreaming bout the day when you wake up and find
That what youre looking for has been here the whole time
If you could see that Im the onе who understands you
Been here all along, so why cant you see?
You bеlong with me, you belong with me
Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I cant help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isnt this easy?
And youve got a smile that could light up this whole town
I havent seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say youre fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?

She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
Shes Cheer Captain and Im on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what youre looking for has been here the whole time
If you could see that Im the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why cant you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me
Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
Im the one who makes you laugh
When you know youre bout to cry
I know your favorite songs
And you tell me bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know its with me
Cant you see that Im the one who understands you?
Been here all along, so why cant you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me
You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me?
You belong with me24Embed
I didnt know what I would find
When I went looking for a reason, I know
I didnt read between the lines
And, baby, Ive got nowhere to go
I tried to take the road less traveled by
But nothing seems to work the first few times
Am I right?
So how can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you, this aint the best view
On the outside looking in
Ive been a lot of lonely places
Ive never been on the outside
You saw me there, but never knew
That I would give it all up to be
A part of this, a part of you
And now its all too late, so you see
You couldve helped if you had wanted to
But no one notices until its too
Late to do anything

How can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you, this aint the best view
On the outside looking in
Ive been a lot of lonely places
Ive never been on the outside
Oh, yeah
How can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
And I can still see you, this aint the best view
On the outside looking in
Ive been a lot of lonely places
Ive never been on the outside

You shouldve been there
Shouldve burst through the door
With that Baby, Im right here smile
And it wouldve felt like
A million little shining stars that just align
And I wouldve been so happy
Christmas lights glisten
Ive got my eye on the door
Just waiting for you to walk in
But the time is ticking
People ask me how Ive been
As I comb back through my memory
How you said youd be here
You said youd be here
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And theyre all laughing
As Im looking around the room
But therе was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knеw

And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
When theres something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts
As I say hopelessly
He said hed be here
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And theyre all laughing
And asking me about you
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
What do you say
When tears are streaming down your face
In front of everyone you know?
And what do you do
When the one who means the most to you
Is the one who didnt show?
You shouldve been here
And I wouldve been so happy
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And theyre all standing around me, singing
Happy birthday to you
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You called me later
And said, Im sorry I didnt make it
And I said, Im sorry, too
And that was the moment I knew11Embed
I took a chance, I took a shot
And you might think Im bulletproof, but Im not
You took a swing, I took it hard
And down here from the ground, I see who you are
Im sick and tired of your attitude
Im feeling like I dont know you
You tell me that you love me, then cut me down
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
That makes me run for cover when youre around
And heres to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what youre doing to me
Tell me why
You could write a book on how to ruin someones perfect day
Well, I get so confused and frustrated
Forget what Im trying to say, oh
Im sick and tired of your reasons
I got no one to believe in
You tell me that you want me, then push me around
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
That makes me run for cover when youre around
Heres to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what youre doing to me
Tell me why

Why do you have to make me feel small
So you can feel whole inside?
Why do you have to put down my dreams
So youre the only thing on my mind?
Im sick and tired of your attitude
Im feeling like I dont know you
You tell me that you want me, then cut me down
Im sick and tired of your reasons
Ive got no one to believe in
You ask me for my love, then you push me around
Heres to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what youre doing to me
Tell me why (Why)
Tell me why (Why)
I take a step back, let you go
I told you Im not bulletproof
Now you know11Embed
You said it in a simple way
4 a.m., the second day
How strange that I dont know you at all
Stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss, then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall
I told myself, Dont get attached
But in my mind, I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you
And this is when the feeling sinks in
I dont wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here
Come back, be here
I guess youre in New York today
I dont wanna need you this way
Come back, be here
Come back, be here
The delicate beginning rush
The feeling you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all
And now that I can put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never wouldve played so nonchalant

Taxi cabs and busy streets
That never bring you back to me
I cant help but wish you took me with you
And this is when the feeling sinks in
I dont wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here
Come back, be here
I guess youre in London today
And I dont wanna need you this way
Come back, be here
Come back, be here
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
This is falling in love in the cruelest way
This is falling for you when you are worlds away
In New York, be here
But youre in London, and I break down
Cause its not fair that youre not around
This is when the feeling sinks in
I dont wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here
Come back, be here
I guess youre in New York today
And I dont wanna need you this way
Come back, be here
Come back, be here
Oh, oh, I dont wanna miss you like this
Oh, oh
Come back, be here
Come back, be here16Embed
I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone and, Lord, it took me away
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light, go
Yeah, you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke wed made
And that was the first day
And darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground
Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big, wide city all to ourselves
Wе block the noise with the sound of I need you
And for thе first time, I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the storys got dust on every page
But, sometimes, I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd

Cause, darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground
Tonight, Im gonna dance
For all that weve been through
But I dont wanna dance
If Im not dancing with you
Tonight, Im gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I dont wanna dance
If Im not dancing with you
It was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground
Tonight, Im gonna dance
For all that weve been through
But I dont wanna dance
If Im not dancing with you
Tonight, Im gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I dont wanna dance
If Im not dancing with you18Embed
I like the way you sound in the morning
Were on the phone and without a warning
I realize your laugh is the best sound
I have ever heard
I like the way I cant keep my focus
I watch you talk, you didnt notice
I hear the words but all I can think is
We should be together
Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, Ill shine for you
Woah-oh, Im feelin you, baby
Dont be afraid to jump, then fall
Jump, then fall into me
Baby, Im never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
Cause Ima stay through it all
So, jump, then fall
Well, I like the way your hair falls in your face
You got the keys to me, I love each freckle on your face, oh
Ive never been so wrapped up, honey
I like the way youre everything I ever wanted
I had time to think it oh-over
And all I can say is, Come closer
Take a deep breath and jump, then fall into me

Cause every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, Ill shine for you
Woah-oh, Im feelin you, baby
Dont be afraid to jump, then fall
Jump, then fall into me
Baby, Im never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
Cause Ima stay through it all
So, jump, then fall
The bottoms gonna drop out from under our feet
Ill catch you, Ill catch you
When people say things that bring you to your knees
Ill catch you
The time is gonna come when youre so mad you could cry
But Ill hold you through the night until you smile
Woah-oh, I need you, baby
Dont be afraid, please, jump, then fall
Jump, then fall into me
Baby, Im never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
Cause Ima stay through it all
So, jump, then fall
Jump, then fall, baby

I dont know what I want, so dont ask me
Cause Im still trying to figure it out
Dont know whats down this road, Im just walking
Trying to see through the rain coming down
Even though Im not the only one
Who feels the way I do
Im alone, on my own, and thats all I know
Ill be strong, Ill be wrong, oh, but life goes on
Oh, Im just a girl trying to find a place in this world
Got the radio on, my old blue jeans
And Im wearing my heart on my sleeve
Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine
Could you tell me what more do I need?
And tomorrows just a mystery, oh, yeah
But thats okay
Im alone, on my own, and thats all I know
Ill be strong, Ill be wrong, oh, but life goes on
Oh, Im just a girl trying to find a place in this world

Maybe Im just a girl on a mission
But Im ready to fly
Im alone, on my own, and thats all I know
Ill be strong, Ill be wrong, oh, but life goes on
Oh, Im alone, on my own, and thats all I know
Oh, Im just a girl trying to find a place in this world
Oh, Im just a girl
Oh, Im just a girl, oh, oh
Oh, Im just a girl16Embed
Long handwritten notes, deep in your pocket
Words, how little they mean when youre a little too late
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful theyll be and long they will wait
We had a beautiful, magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair
In dreams, I meet you in warm conversation
And we both wake in lonely beds and different cities
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
And youve got your demons and, darling, they all look like me
Cause wе had a beautiful, magic love therе
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair
Woah, woah
Distance, timing, breakdown, fighting
Silence, the train runs off its tracks
Kiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen?
Hang up, give up and for the life of us, we cant get back

A beautiful, magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic, beautiful, tragic, beautiful
What we had, a beautiful, magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair
We had a beautiful, magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair17Embed
It was all over the place
A fractured mosaic of feelings that somehow all fit together in the end
Happy, free, confused, lonely, devastated, euphoric, wild
And tortured by memories past
These are the original thirty songs that were meant for Red
I love you guys4Embed
Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didnt like it when I wore high heels
But I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didnt get this song
But I do, I do
I walked in, expecting youd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you dont know how nice that is
But I do
And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think its strange that you think Im funny cause he never did
Ive been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break, and burn, and end
But on a Wеdnesday in a café, I watched it begin again
You said you nеver met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you
But I do
We tell stories and you dont know why
Im coming off a little shy
But I do

But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think its strange that you think Im funny cause he never did
Ive been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break, and burn, and end
But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again

And we walked down the block to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies
That your family watches every single Christmas
And I want to talk about that
And for the first time, whats past is past
Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think its strange that you think Im funny cause he never did
Ive been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break, and burn, and end
But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again
On a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again12Embed
I remember your bare feet down the hallway
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs
I love you to the moon and back
I remember your blue eyes looking into mine
Like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing before bedtime
Then jumping on me, waking me up
I can still feel you hold my hand, little man
And even the moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you
Come on, baby, with me
Were going to fly away from here
You were my best four years
I remember the drive home, when the blind hope
Turned to crying and screaming, Why?
Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say
About a beautiful boy who died
And its about to be Halloween, you could be anything
You wanted if you were still here
I remember the last day, when I kissed your face
And whispered in your ear

Come on, baby, with me
Were going to fly away from here
Out of this curtained room and this hospital gray
Well just disappear
Come on, baby, with me
Were going to fly away from here
You were my best four years
What if Im standing in your closet trying to talk to you?
And what if I kept the hand-me-downs you wont grow into?
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?
What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you?
Come on, baby, with me
Were going to fly away from here
Come on, baby, with me
Were going to fly away from here
You were my best four years
I remember your bare feet down the hallway
I love you to the moon and back13Embed
New to town with a made-up name
In the angels city, chasing fortune and fame
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream
You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
So overnight, you look like a sixties queen
Another name goes up in lights
Like diamonds in the sky
And theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one
Yeah, theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one
But can you tell me now, youre the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh
And now, its big black cars and Riviera views
And your lover in the foyer doesnt even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
And they tell you that youre lucky, but youre so confused
Cause you dont feel pretty, you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place

Another name goes up in lights
You wonder if youll make it out alive
And theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one
Yeah, theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one
Can you tell me now, youre the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
It was a few years later, I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the rose garden over Madison Square
And it took some time, but I understand it now
Cause now my name is up in lights
But I think you got it right
Let me tell you now, youre the lucky one
Let me tell you now, youre the lucky one
Let me tell you now, youre the lucky one, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one
Yeah, theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one
Let me tell you now, youre the lucky one, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh18Embed
I bet this time of night, youre still up
I bet youre tired from a long hard week
I bet youre sittin in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city, and I bet
Sometimes you wonder bout me
And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that every time I dont
I almost do
I almost do
I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
Cause each time you reach out, theres no reply
I bet it never, ever occurred to you
That I cant say hello to you and risk another goodbye
And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that every time I don’t
I almost do

Oh, we made quite a mess, babe
Its probably better off this way
And I confess, baby
In my dreams, youre touching my face
And asking me if I wanna try again with you
And I almost do
And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that every time I dont
I almost do

I bet youre tired from a long hard week

She cant see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile
Shell never notice how you stop and stare
Whenever she walks by
And you cant see me wanting you the way you want her
But you are everything to me
And I just wanna show you
She dont even know you
Shes never gonna love you like I want to
And you just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable
Instead of just invisible
Oh, yeah, oh
Theres a fire inside of you
That cant help but shine through
Shes never gonna see the light
No matter what you do

And all I think about is how to make you think of me
And everything that we could be

I find myself at your door
Just like all those times before
I’m not sure how I got there
All roads they lead me here
I imagine you are home
In your room, all alone
And you open your eyes into mine
And everything feels better
And right before your eyes
Im breaking
No past, no reasons why
Just you and me
This is the last time Im asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time Im asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye
You find yourself at my door
And just like all those times before
You wear your best apology
But I was there to watch you leave
And all the times I let you in
Just for you to go again
Disappear when you come back
Everything is better

And right before your eyes
Im aching
No past, nowhere to hide
Just you and me
This is the last time Im asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time Im asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye
This is the last time you tell me Ive got it wrong
This is the last time I say, Its been you all along
This is the last time I let you in my door
This is the last time, I wont hurt you anymore
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
This is the last time Im asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time Im asking you why

Dont look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don’t look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
I dont even know her
But I feel a responsibility
To do whats upstanding and right
It’s kinda like a code, yeah
And youve been getting closer and closer
And crossing so many lines
And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
But, honey, I am no ones exception
This, I have previously learned
So dont look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Dont look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, еverybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now youve got mе alone, and I say
Dont look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that

I just wanna make sure
You understand perfectly
Youre the kind of man who makes me sad
While she waits up
You chase down the newest thing
And take for granted what you have
And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
And, yeah, I might go with it
If I hadn’t once been just like her
So don’t look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Dont look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now you’ve got me alone, and I say
Dont look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Call a cab, lose my number
Youre about to lose your girl
Call a cab, lose my number
Lets consider this lesson learned
Don’t look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Dont look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
Wanna see you pick up your phone
And tell her youre coming home
Dont look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
It would be a fine proposition
If I hadnt once been just like her15Embed
In the heat of the fight I walked away
Ignorin words that you were sayin
Tryna make me stay
I said, This time Ive had enough
And youve called a hundred times
But Im not picking up
Cause Im so mad I might tell you that its over
But if you look a little closer
I said, Leave, but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwin pebbles
Screamin, Im in love with you
Wait there in the pourin rain, comin back for more
And dont you leave cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door
Me and my stupid pride are sittin here alone
Goin through the photographs, starin at the phone
I keep goin back over things we both said
And I remember the slamming door
And all the things that I misread

Oh, babe, if you know everything
Tell me why you couldnt see
When I left, I wanted you to chase after me, yeah
I said, Leave, but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwin pebbles
Screamin, Im in love with you
Wait there in the pourin rain, comin back for more
And dont you leave cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door
And Ill scream out the window
I cant even look at you
I dont need you but I do, I do, I do
I say, Theres nothing you can say
To make this right again, I mean it, I mean it
But what I mean is
I said, Leave, but, baby, all I want is you
To stand outside my window throwin pebbles
Screamin, Im in love with you
Wait there in the pourin rain, comin back for more
And dont you leave cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door
With your face and the beautiful eyes
And the conversation with the little white lies
And the faded picture of a beautiful night
You carried me from your car up the stairs
And I broke down crying, was she worth this mess?
After everything and that little black dress
After everything I must confess, I need you18Embed
This is wrong but I cant help but feel like
There ain’t nothing more right babe
Misty morning comes again and I cant
Help but wish I could see your face
And I knew from the first note played
Id be breaking all my rules to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row
Scream your name
So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I cant take my eyes off of you
Im no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Whos desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar
Good morning loneliness
Comes around when Im not dreaming about you
When my world wakes up today
Youll be in another town
And I knew when I saw your face
Id be counting down the ways to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row Scream your name

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I cant take my eyes off of you
Im no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Whos desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar
You played in bars, you play guitar
And Im invisible and everyone knows who you are
And youll never see, you sing me to sleep
Every night from the radio
So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I cant take my eyes off of you
Im no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Whos desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar
Sweet, sweet superstar

He said, Lets get out of this town
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds
I thought, Heaven cant help me now
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down
Hes so tall and handsome as hell
Hes so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is
Say youll remember me
Standin in a nice dress
Starin at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say youll see me again
Even if its just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
I said, No one has to know what wе do
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voicе is a familiar sound
Nothin lasts forever
But this is gettin good now

Hes so tall and handsome as hell
Hes so bad, but he does it so well
And when weve had our very last kiss
My last request it is
Say youll remember me
Standin in a nice dress
Starin at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say youll see me again
Even if its just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha (Ha, ha)
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
Youll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night

How long does it take, where do you write, what are the circumstances, do you start with music, do you start with lyrics, and my answer is always that it happens differently every time, and thats why Im still so in love with song writing
So what Ive done here is shown you three different examples of the beginning stages of these songs and how they each started, different ways
So Ill explain them to you and maybe that will help you understand kind of how I put songs together
I sent this voice memo to Ryan Tedder because Id always wanted to work with him, and finally we scheduled some studio time
So I always wanna be prepared
I wanted to send him the idea that I was working on before we went into the studio just in case he wrote back and said I cant stand that, I wanna work on something else, think of something else
So I just sat down with the piano, put my phone on top of the piano and just kind of explained to him where I wanted to go with the song, how I saw the melody sitting in and we ended up recording the song the next day and it ended up being on the record called I Know Places
So this was the voice memo that I sent to him the night before we ended up finishing the song
Okay so this is kind of this rough idea thing:
Uh-uh-uh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i-i-i
Na na na na waiting at the back door
Theyre around and the vultures come around
And you know that they wont, they wont us
Say what they want bout, say what they want bout us
And you come and sing and listen
I would not think about it but Im not done
Every know that a thing or two about it, thing or two about it, I
Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes
And guns
They are the hunters we are the foxes
And we run
Baby, I know some places we wont be found
And theyll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places, I know places
Uh-uh-uh-i, uh-uh-uh-i, oh-oh-i, uh-uh-uh-i, know places
Or whatever
I dont know, but thats basically just like a dark, really dark lyric, like, bridge thing and its about, like, everybodys, like, trying to get into and ruin a love or whatever, and its like you just, whatever, you know, and the chorus would just go to that major and just be like ooh chorus
So I hope you like it, it wouldnt be a piano thing
It would be, like, 
Like, very, like, beat. Now Im just making weird sounds
Hope you like it!6Embed

Hey Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked we were talking
I didnt say half the things I wanted to
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
Ill be the one waiting there even when its cold
Hey Stephen, boy, you might have me believing
I dont always have to be alone
Cause I cant help it if you look like an angel
Cant help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
Come feel this magic Ive been feeling since I met you
Cant help it if theres no one else
Mmm, I cant help myself
Hey Stephen, Ive been holding back this feeling
So Ive got some things to say to you (Huh)
Ive seen it all, so I thought
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do
The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
Its beautiful, wonderful, dont you ever change
Hey Stephen, why are people always leaving?
I think you and I should stay the same

Cause I cant help it if you look like an angel
Cant help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
Come feel this magic Ive been feeling since I met you
Cant help it if theres no one else
Mmm, I cant help myself
Theyre dimming the street lights, youre perfect for me
Why arent you here tonight?
Im waiting alone now, so come on and come out
And pull me near and shine, shine, shine
Hey Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose
All those other girls, well, theyre beautiful
But would they write a song for you? (Ha-ha-ha)
I cant help it if you look like an angel
Cant help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
Come feel this magic Ive been feeling since I met you
Cant help it if theres no one else
Mmm, I cant help myself
If you look like an angel
Cant help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
Come feel this magic Ive been feeling since I met you
Cant help it if theres no one else
Mmm, I cant help myself
Ah-uh, myself
Mmm-mm, I cant help myself
I cant help myself

Everybodys waiting
Everybodys watching
Even when youre sleeping
Keep your eyes open
The tricky thing is yesterday we were just children
Playing soldiers, just pretending
Dreaming dreams with happy endings
In backyards, winning battles with our wooden swords
But now weve stepped into a cruel world
Where everybody stands and keeps score
Keep your eyes open
Everybodys waiting for you to break down
Everybodys watching to see the fallout
Even when youre sleeping, sleeping
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
So here you are, two steps ahead and staying on guard
Every lesson forms a new scar
They never thought youd make it this far
But turn around (Turn around)
Oh, theyve surrounded you, its a showdown (Showdown)
And nobody comes to save you now
But you got something they dont
Yeah, you got something they dont

You just gotta keep your eyes open
Everybodys waiting for you to break down
Everybodys watching to see the fallout
Even when youre sleeping, sleeping
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes—
Keep your feet ready, heartbeat steady
Keep your eyes open
Keep your aim locked, the night goes dark
Keep your eyes open
(Keep your eyes open)
(Keep your eyes open)

(Keep your eyes open)
Everybodys waiting for you to break down
Everybodys watching to see the fallout
Even when youre sleeping, sleeping

I could go back to every laugh
But I dont wanna go there anymore
And I know all the steps up to your door
But I dont wanna go there anymore
Talk to the wind, talk to the sky
Talk to the man with the reasons why
And let me know what you find
Ill leave my window open
Cause Im too tired at night to call your name
Just know Im right here hoping
That youll come in with the rain
I could stand up and sing you a song
But I dont wanna have to go that far
And I, Ive got you down, I know you by heart
And you dont even know where I start
Talk to yourself, talk to the tears
Talk to the man who put you here
And dont wait for the sky to clear

Ill leave my window open
Cause Im too tired at night to call your name
Just know Im right here hoping
That youll come in with the rain
Ive watched you so long, screamed your name
I dont know what else I can say
But Ill leave my window open
Cause Im too tired at night for all these games
Just know Im right here hoping
That youll come in with the rain
I could go back to every laugh
But I dont wanna go there anymore9Embed
Untouchable like a distant diamond sky

You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
Its the mornin of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you aint seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybodys way
Its your freshman year and youre gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hopin one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
You know, I havent seen you around before
Cause when youre fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
Youre gonna believe them
And when youre fifteen, feelin like theres nothin to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who youre gonna be
At fifteen
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough, youre best friends
Laughin at the other girls who think theyre so cool
Well be outta here as soon as we can
And then youre on your very first date and hes got a car
And youre feelin like flyin
And your mamas waitin up and youre thinkin hes the one
And youre dancin round your room when the night ends
When the night ends

Cause when youre fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
Youre gonna believe them
And when youre fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin around, well
In your life youll do things greater than
Datin the boy on the football team
I didnt know it at fifteen
When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had
To a boy who changed his mind
And we both cried
Cause when youre fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
Youre gonna believe them
And when youre fifteen, dont forget to look before you fall
But Ive found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who youre supposed to be
I didnt know who I was supposed to be
At fifteen
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la
Your very first day
Take a deep breath, girl
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors16Embed
Um, so I brought in this idea called Blank Space, and this was me playing it for Max and Johan for the first time and theyre shouting out these proju— production ideas like, you know the Oh! at the beginning of the chorus, um, and that ended up in the song
So, this is the very beginning stages of the song on the album called Blank Space.
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Diamonds, seasides, all these gems
 this song that 
Like, oh my God, listen in
Listen in, I do too
 honest 
We can all sing this and cry
All youre thinking, all this time
Oh my God, listen me
Just forget what youve heard about me
Dont believe what you hear about me, hear about me
Cause its gonna be forever, or gonna go—
Yeah! Hey, hey!
Gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when its over—
This is like a, like an early 2000s Nelly track
Long list of ex-love—
Got a long list of ex-lovers, theyll tell you Im insane
But Ive got a blank space, baby
Ill write your name
Ive got a blank space, baby
Ill write your name
Thats awesome! I love it
Oh my god, everyones gonna kill you
Yeah!14Embed
The way you move is like a full-on rainstorm
And Im a house of cards
You say my name for the first time, baby
And I fall in love in an empty bar
And you stood there in front of me just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldnt see what I was thinking of
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something thatll haunt me when youre not around
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
So reach out open handed and lead me out to that floor
I dont need more paper lanterns
Take me down, baby
Bring on the movie score
Cause my heart is beating fast and you are beautiful
I could wait patiently, but I really wish you would

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something thatll haunt me when youre not around
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
Just keep your beautiful eyes on me
Gonna strike this match tonight
And lead me up the staircase
Wont you whisper soft and slow
Id love to hate it, but you make it like a firework show
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something thatll haunt me when youre not around
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
And the sparks fly
Oh, baby, smile
And the sparks fly4Embed
You good to go?
All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now
Know something now I didnt before
And all Ive seen since eighteen hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind, making me feel like
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you
Know you, know you
Cause all I know is we said hello
And your eyes look like coming homе
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changеd
All I know is you held the door
Youll be mine and Ill be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

And all my walls stood tall, painted blue
But Ill take em down, take em down
And open up the door for you
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
The beautiful kind, makin up for lost time
Takin flight, making me feel like
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you
Know you, know you
Cause all I know is we said hello
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
Youll be mine and Ill be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed
Come back and tell me why
Im feeling like Ive missed you all this time
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that its not all in my mind
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you
Know you, know you
All I know is we said hello
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
And youll be mine and Ill be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed
All I know is we said hello
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain
And everything has changed
All I know is a new found grace
All my days, Ill know your face
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed10Embed
Im pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn away
But you stayed
This morning, I said we should talk about it
Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
Thats when you came in wearing a football helmet
And said, Okay, lets talk
And I said, Stay, stay, stay
Ive been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that its funny when Im mad, mad, mad
But I think that its best if we both stay
Before you, Id only dated self-indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now Im always laughing
And I love you because you have given me
No choice but to stay, stay, stay
Ive been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that its funny when Im mad, mad, mad
But I think that its best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay

You took the time to memorize me
My fears, my hopes, and dreams
I just like hanging out with you
All the time
All those times that you didnt leave
Its been occurring to me
Id like to hang out with you
For my whole life
Stay
And Ill be loving you for quite some time
No one else is gonna love me when I get mad, mad, mad
So I think that its best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay
Ive been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that its funny when Im mad, mad, mad
But I think that its best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay
Ive been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that its funny when Im mad, mad, mad
But I think that its best if we both stay
Thats so fun17Embed
I remember when we broke up
The first time, sayin, This is it, Ive had enough
Cause, like, we hadnt seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space (What?)
Then you come around again and say
Baby, I miss you and I swear Im gonna change
Trust me, remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, I hate you, we break up, you call me, I love you
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
We called it off again last night, but
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, Im telling you, Im telling you
We are never, evеr, ever getting back togеther
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together
Like, ever
Im really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, screaming that Im right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record thats much cooler than mine

Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You called me up again tonight, but
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, Im telling you, Im telling you
We (We) are never, ever, ever getting back together

And Im, like, Im just, I mean, this is exhausting, you know?
Like, we are never getting back together
Like, ever (No)

It feels like a perfect night

And make fun of our exes
Uh-uh, uh-uh
It feels like a perfect night
For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers

Were happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time
Its miserable and magical, oh yeah
Tonights the night when we forget about the deadlines

I see your face in my mind as I drive away
Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
People are people and sometimes we change our minds
But its killing me to see you go after all this time
Mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm
The music starts playing like the end of a sad movie
Its the kind of ending you dont really wanna see
Cause its tragedy and itll only bring you down
Now I dont know what to be without you around
And we know its never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
Youre the only thing I know like the back of my hand
And I cant breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to
Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
Every little bump in the road, I tried to swerve
But people are people and sometimes it doesnt work out
And nothin we say is gonna save us from the fallout

And we know its never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
Youre the only thing I know like the back of my hand
And I cant breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you but I have to
Its 2 A.M., feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know its not easy, easy for me
Its 2 A.M., feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know this aint easy, easy for me
And we know its never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me, oh
I cant breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to
Im sorry, Im sorry (Mmm)
Im sorry, (Yeah, yeah) Im sorry
Im sorry, Im sorry (Ooh, ooh)

(Im the problem, its me)
I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
Ive ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, Ill watch as youre leaving
Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)
Its me, hi
Im the problem, its me
At teatime, everybody agrees
Ill stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

(Always rooting for the anti-hero)
Sometimes, I feel like everybody is an art bro lately
And I just judge them on the hill
Too hurt to hang out, talking shit about your famous baby
Pierced through the heart of 90s guilt
Maybe Im the problem, its me
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?
(Taylor, youll be fine)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, Ill watch as youre leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
(For the last time)
Its me (Me), hi (Hi)
Im the problem, its me (Im the problem, its me)
At teatime (Teatime), everybody agrees
Ill stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
Always rooting for the anti-hero
I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers round and reads it and then someone screams out
Shes laughing up at us from Hell
Im the problem, its me
(Taylor)
(Im the problem, its me)
Its me, hi (Hi)
Im the problem, its me (Im the problem, its me)
At teatime (Teatime), everybody agrees (Everybody agrees)
Ill stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
Always rooting for the anti-hero
Always rooting for the anti-hero
Always rooting for the anti-hero
Always rooting for the anti-hero
Always rooting for the anti-hero
Always rooting for the anti-hero

Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
But I knew you
Dancin in your Levis
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someones bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite
A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you
Living in a gold age
Sneaking to my bird cage, I
I knew you
Laughing like a damn fool
Breaking every damn rule, I
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someones bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite
And then, I have like this-- theres like a break, because I dont really know whats gonna happen here, but I do have like a... I think its here? Was where I was putting a-- a bridge thing. 
And to kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
Now Im bleedin
Im bleedin
Well work on that and not make it bad. And then, um, theres all this time, but when the, like, kind of major chorus comes back in, I wait til then, and then, I start singing again. I dont think its right now, but... there it is. The ending. 
Cause I knew you
Steppin on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter leaving Wendy, I
I knew you
Dancing in your Levis
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
That when you are young, they assume you know nothing
But I knew youd linger like a stolen kiss
I knew youd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew Id curse you for the longest time
I knew Id wish you wouldve changed your mind
I knew youd miss me once the moment died
I knew to love would be to lose my mind
And then, I dont know. You let me know what you think. And, uh, thats just kind of like a rough idea of... something. Let me know if you like it. 2Embed
Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I dont feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please tell me
Cause one second it was perfect
Now youre halfway out the door
And I stare at the phone, he still hasnt called
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, Forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
Cause I was there when you said, Forever and always
Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now Im not so sure
So heres to everything coming down to nothing
Heres to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I dont anymore

And I stare at the phone, he still hasnt called
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, Forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
Cause I was there when you said, Forever and always
You didnt mean it baby, I dont think so
Oh, back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Cause it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
Cause I was there when you said, Forever and always
Oh, I stare at the phone, he still hasnt called
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when we said, Forever and always
And it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
Cause I was there when you said, Forever and always
You didnt mean it baby
You said, Forever and always, yeah11Embed
Say youre sorry, that face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
Cause I honestly believed in you
Holdin on, the days drag on
Stupid girl, I shoulda known, I shoulda known
That Im not a princess, this aint a fairytale
Im not the one youll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This aint Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now its too late for you and your white horse
To come around
Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
Well, my mistakе, I didnt know to be in love
You had to fight to have thе upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, well now I know

That Im not a princess, this aint a fairytale
Im not the one youll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This aint Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now its too late for you and your white horse
To come around
And there you are on your knees
Beggin for forgiveness, beggin for me
Just like I always wanted
But Im so sorry
Cause Im not your princess, this aint our fairytale
Im gonna find someone someday
Who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rearview mirror disappearing now
And its too late for you and your white horse
Now its too late for you and your white horse
To catch me now
Oh, woah, woah, woah
Try and catch me now, oh
Its too late to catch me now17Embed
Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take
Our love and tear it all apart now?
Why would you wanna make
The very first scar?
Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?
Maybe I shouldve seen the signs
Shouldve read the writing on the wall
And realized by the distance in your eyes
That I would be the one to fall
No matter what you say
I still cant believe that you would walk away
It dont make sense to me, but
Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take
Our love and tear it all apart now?
Why would you wanna make
The very first scar?
Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?

Its not unbroken anymore (Its not unbroken anymore)
How do I get it back the way it was before?
Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take
Our love and tear it all apart now?
Why would you wanna make
The very first scar?
Why would you wanna break—
(Why) Would you wanna break it?
Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take
Our love and tear it all apart now?
Why would you wanna make
The very first scar?
Why would you wanna break

Clear blue water
High tide came and brought you in
And I could go on and on, on and on, and I will
Skies grew darker
Currents swept you out again
And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone
In silent screams, in wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this
This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh
Oh, oh
Tossing, turning
Struggled through the night with someone new
Baby, I could go on and on, on and on
Lantern, burning
Flickered in the night for only you
But you were still gone, gone, gone

In losing grip, on sinking ships
You showed up just in time
This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh
This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love)
Your kiss, my cheek
I watched you leave
Your smile, my ghost
I fell to my knees
When youre young, you just run
But you come back to what you need
This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh
(This love) This love left a permanent mark
(This love) This love is glowing in the dark, oh
(This love) These hands had to let it go free, and

I said, Oh my, what a marvelous tune
It was the best night
Never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like were made of starlight
Like were made of starlight
I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of 45
Picks me up late one night
Out the window, we were seventeen and crazy, running wild, wild
Cant remember what song it was playing whеn we walked in
The night wе snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince
And I said, Oh my, what a marvelous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like were made of starlight, starlight
Like were made of starlight, starlight
He said, Look at you, worrying too much about things you cant change
Youll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me
Dont you see the starlight, starlight?
Dont you dream impossible things?

Like, Oh my, what a marvelous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like were made of starlight, starlight
Like were made of starlight, starlight
Ooh-ooh, hes talking crazy
Ooh-ooh, dancing with me
Ooh-ooh, we could get married
Have ten kids and teach them how to dream
(Ooh, hoo, hoo)
(Ooh, hoo, hoo)
(Ooh, hoo, hoo)
(Ooh, hoo, hoo)
Oh my, what a marvelous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like were made of starlight, starlight
Like were made of starlight, starlight
Like were made of starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Like starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams

All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around
Ive been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down
And its taken me this long, baby, but Ive figured you out
And youre thinking well be fine again, but not this time around
You dont have to call anymore
I wont pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Dont wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that youre sorry
But I dont believe you, baby, like I did before
Youre not sorry
No, no, oh-oh
Youre looking so innocent, I might believe you if I didnt know
Couldve loved you all my life if you hadnt lеft me waiting in the cold
And youve got your sharе of secrets
And Im tired of being last to know, oh
And now youre asking me to listen
Cause its worked each time before
But you dont have to call anymore
I wont pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Dont wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that youre sorry
But I dont believe you, baby, like I did before
Youre not sorry
No, no, oh-oh
Youre not sorry
No, no, oh-oh

You had me crawling for you, honey
And it never wouldve gone away, no
You used to shine so bright, but I watched all of it fade
So you dont have to call anymore
I wont pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Theres nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that youre sorry
But I dont believe you, baby, like I did before
Youre not sorry
No, no, oh-oh
Youre not sorry

Today was a fairytale, you were the prince
I used to be a damsel in distress
You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale, I wore a dress
You wore a dark gray t-shirt
You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale
Time slows down
Whenever youre around
Well, can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale, youve got a smile
That takes me to another planet
Every move you make, everything you say is right
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale, all that I can say
Is now its getting so much clearer
Nothing made sense til the time I saw your face
Today was a fairytale
Time slows down
Whenever youre around, yeah
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
Time slows down
Whenever youre around
I can feel my heart
Its beating in my chest
Did you feel it?
I cant put this down
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
Oh, oh, yeah, oh
Today was a fairytale11Embed
Macavitys a mystery cat, hes called the Hiddenpaw
For hes the master criminal who can defy the law
Hes the bafflement of Scotland Yard, the Flying Squads despair
For when they reach the scene of crime, Macavitys not there
Macavity, Macavity, theres no one like Macavity
Hes broken every human law, he breaks the law of gravity
His powers of levitation would make a fakir stare
But when they reach the scene of crime, Macavitys not there
Macavitys a ginger cat, hes very tall and thin
You would know him if you saw him for his eyes are sunken in
His brow is deeply lined with thought, his head is highly domed
His coat is dusty from neglect, his whiskers are uncombed
He sways his head from side to side, with movements like a snake
And when you think hes half asleep, hes always wide awake
Macavity, Macavity, theres no one like Macavity
For hes a fiend in feline shape, a monster of depravity
You may meet him in a by-street, you may see him in the square
But when a crimes discovered, then Macavitys not there

Hes outwardly respectable, I know, he cheats at cards
And his footprints are not found in any files of Scotland Yards
And when the larders looted and the jewel case is rifled
Or when the milk is missing or another pekes been stifled
Or the greenhouse glass is broken and the trellis past repair
Theres the wonder of the thing, Macavitys not there
Macavity, Macavity, theres no one like Macavity
There never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity
He always has an alibi, and one or two to spare
What ever time the deed took place, Macavity wasnt there
And they say that all the cats whose wicked deeds are widely known
I might mention Mungojerrie, Rumpleteazer, Griddlebone
Are nothing more than agents for the cat who all the time
Just controls the operations, the Napoleon of Crime
Macavity, Macavity, theres no one like Macavity
Hes a fiend in feline shape, a monster of depravity
You may meet him in a by-street, you may see him in the square
But when a crimes discovered, then Macavity, Macavity
Macavity, Macavity
When a crimes discovered, then
Macavitys not there2Embed
I like the way you sound in the mornin
Were on the phone and without a warnin
I realize your laugh is the best sound
I have ever heard
I like the way I cant keep my focus
I watch you talk, you didnt notice
I hear the words, but all I can think is
We should be together
Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, Ill shine for you
Woah-oh, Im feelin you, baby
Dont be afraid to jump, then fall
Jump, then fall into me
Baby, Im never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
Cause Ima stay through it all
So, jump, then fall
Huh, well, I like the way your hair falls in your face
You got the keys to me, I love each freckle on your face, oh
Ive never been so wrapped up, honey
I like the way youre everything I ever wanted
I had time to think it oh-over
And all I can say is, Come closer
Take a deep breath and jump, then fall into me

Cause every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, Ill shine for you
Woah-oh, Im feelin you, baby
Dont be afraid to jump, then fall
Jump, then fall into me
Baby, Im never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
Cause Ima stay through it all
So, jump, then fall
The bottoms gonna drop out from under our feet
Ill catch you, Ill catch you
When people say things that bring you to your knees
Ill catch you
The time is gonna come when youre so mad you could cry
But Ill hold you through the night until you smile
Woah-oh, I need you, baby
Dont be afraid, please, jump, then fall
Jump, then fall into me
Baby, Im never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
Cause Ima stay through it all
So, jump, then fall
Jump, then fall, baby
Jump, then fall into me, into me
Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, Ill shine
And every time youre here
Baby, Ill show you, Ill show you
You can jump, then fall, jump, then fall
Jump, then fall into me, into me, yeah13Embed
I took a chance, I took a shot
And you might think Im bulletproof, but Im not
You took a swing, I took it hard
And down here from the ground, I see who you are
Im sick and tired of your attitude
Im feeling like I dont know you
You tell me that you love me, then cut me down
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
Makes me run for cover when youre around
Heres to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what youre doin to me
Tell me why
Well, you could write a book on
How to ruin someones perfеct day
Well, I get so confused and frustratеd
Forget what Im tryin to say, oh
Im sick and tired of your reasons
I got no one to believe in
You tell me that you want me, then push me around
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
Makes me run for cover when youre around
Heres to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what youre doin to me
Tell me why

Why do you have to make me feel small
So you can feel whole inside?
Why do you have to put down my dreams
So youre the only thing on my mind?
Well, Im sick and tired of your attitude
Feeling like I dont know you
You tell me that you want me and cut me down
Im sick and tired of your reasons
Ive got no one to believe in
You ask me for my love, then you push me around
Heres to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what youre doin to me
Tell me why, why
Tell me why, oh
I take a step back, I let you go
I told you Im not bulletproof
Now you know13Embed
Lets break it down, I’ll take the story from the slamming of the door
Thought it was perfect for a second, guess you werent quite as sure
Maybe Im a little hard to get, maybe you didn’t have the patience
Lets assess the situation
That girl was biding her time, yeah, she was waiting on your cue
So somehow Im not surprised to see her standin there with you
Maybe shes a little overdressed and I can see the smile youre fakin
And the deep breath youre takin’
When you see me now, you’re not looking at her
Yeah, its a long way down from the bridges you burned
Might wanna sit down, I’m calling you out
Right now
Cause youre a heartbreaker and shes a little drama queen
I’m a little over it and shes still not me
So long and back to reality
But this songs for you and your drama queen
As I was saying, I was never quite a fan of your games
It doesnt take too long to see that boys like you are all the same
Maybe Im a little less obsessed, but shes impressed
And I should mention, shes starving for attention

And I can see it now, how its all gonna be
When she freaks out, youll be thinkin of me
Cause what went down is coming back around
Youll see
Cause youre a heartbreaker and shes a little drama queen
Im a little over it and shes still not me
So long and back to reality
But this songs for you and your drama queen
Sometimes you get just what you see
Like you chose her when you couldve had me
Everythings a mess now, watch her little meltdown
Wish you both success and I hope youre happy
Cause youre a heartbreaker, shes a little drama queen
Im a little over it and shes still not me
So long and back to reality
But this songs for you and your drama
Heartbreaker, shes a little drama queen
Im a little over it and shes still not me
So long and back to reality
But this songs for you and your drama queen
Huh-oh, for you and your drama queen
Oh-oh-oh-oh, you and your drama queen
Huh-oh, baby, youre a drama queen1Embed
Im five years old, its getting cold, Ive got my big coat on
I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
Look now, the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home
I dont know why all the trees change in the fall
But I know youre not scared of anything at all
Dont know if Snow Whites house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today
Im thirteen now and dont know how my friends could be so mean
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop til Ive forgotten all their names
I dont know who Im gonna talk to now at school
But I know Im laughing on the car ride home with you
Dont know how long its gonna take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today
I have an excellent father
His strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother
Inside and out, hes better than I am
I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run and I
Had the best days with you

There is a video I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and youre talking to me
Its the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarves
Daddys smart and youre the prettiest lady in the whole wide world
Now I know why all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes
For staying back and watching me shine
And I didnt know if you knew
So Im taking this chance to say
That I had the best day with you today9Embed
Well, its a sad picture, the final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
You know it’s all the same, another time and place
Repeating history and youre getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And Ill do anything to see it through
Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we’ll sing hallelujah, well sing hallelujah
Oh, oh
So weve been outnumbered, raidеd, and now cornered
Its hard to fight when thе fight aint fair
Were getting stronger now, find things they never found
They might be bigger but were faster and never scared
You can walk away, say we dont need this
But there’s something in your eyes says we can beat this
’Cause these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And well sing hallelujah, we’ll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh

Tonight, well stand, get off our knees
Fight for what weve worked for all these years
And the battle was long, its the fight of our lives
But we’ll stand up champions tonight
It was the night things changed
Can you see it now?
When the walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
Its a revolution, throw your hands up
Cause we never gave in
And well sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah
Hallelujah7Embed
This is wrong but I cant help but feel like
There ain’t nothing more right, babe
Misty morning comes again and I cant
Help but wish I could see your face
I knew from the first note played
Id be breaking all my rules to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row
Scream your name
So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I cant keep my eyes off of you
Im no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Whos desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph
To hang on my wall, superstar
Morning lonelinеss comes around when Im not
Dreaming about you
Whеn my world wakes up today
Youll be in another town
And I knew when I saw your face
Id be counting down the ways to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row
Scream your name

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I cant take my eyes off of you
Im no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Whos desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph
To hang on my wall, superstar
You played in bars, you play guitar
Im invisible and everyone knows who you are
And youll never see, you sing me to sleep
Every night from the radio
So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I cant take my eyes off of you
Im no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Whos desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph
To hang on my wall, superstar
Sweet, sweet superstar

Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground (oh, oh)
Only sound, only sound that you hear is no
You never saw it coming
Slipped when you started running
And now youve come undone and (I, I, I, I)
Seen you fall, seen you crawl on your knees (eh, eh)
Seen you lost in a crowd, seen your colors fade
Wish I could make it better
Someday you wont remember
This pain you thought would last forever and ever
There you stand, ten feet tall
I will say, I knew it all along
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction
Just a shot, just a shot in the dark (oh, oh)
All you got, all you got are your shattered hopes
They never saw it coming
You hit the ground running
And now youre on to something
I, I, I say
What a sight, what a sight when the light came on
Proved me right, proved me right when you proved them wrong
And in this perfect weather
Its like we dont remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever

There you stand, ten feet tall
I will say, I knew it all along
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction
There you stand, next to me
All at once, the rest is history
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction, fiction
I’ll be one of the many saying
Look at you now, look at you now, now
I’ll be one of the many saying
You made us proud, you made us proud, proud
I’ll be one of the many saying
Look at you now, look at you now, now
I’ll be one of the many saying
You made us proud, you made us proud, proud
And when they call your name
And they put your picture in a frame
You know that I’ll be there time and again
Cause I loved you when
When you hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh
Only sound, only sound that you heard was no
Now in this perfect weather
Its like we dont remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever
There you stand, ten feet tall
I will say, I knew it all along
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction
There you stand, next to me
All at once, the rest is history
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction, fiction15Embed
I could go back to every laugh
But I dont wanna go there anymore
And I know all the steps up to your door
But I dont wanna go there anymore
Talk to the wind, talk to the sky
Talk to the man with the reasons why
And let me know what you find
Ill leave my window open
Cause Im too tired at night to call your name
Just know Im right here hoping
That youll come in with the rain
I could stand up and sing you a song
But I dont wanna have to go that far
And I, Ive got you down, I know you by heart
And you dont even know where I start
Talk to yourself, talk to the tears
Talk to the man who put you here
And dont wait for the sky to clear

Ill leave my window open
Cause Im too tired at night to call your name, oh
Just know Im right here hoping
That youll come in with the rain
Ive watched you so long, screamed your name
I dont know what else I can say
Ill leave my window open
Cause Im too tired at night for all these games
Just know Im right here hoping
That youll come in with the rain
I could go back to every laugh
But I dont wanna go there anymore8Embed
I could have keyed your car

Tire swings, summer dreams, honeysuckle on the breeze
Wilson County creek
Laying in the green grass, I was watching clouds pass
Baby, you were watching me
Cold barns, truck beds, everything you said
Slowly educating me
I never had a lesson so sweet
You can get high on a first kiss
You can get by with sweet tea and Gods graces
You can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
Nothings shatterproof
You can crash and burn and come back someone new
And thats what I learned from you
Autumn rain, window pane, looking how the leaves change
Just like the two of us
Still got your laugh, your ghost, your jacket
Guess I loved you way too much
But Im a little smarter, my hearts a little harder
But its still soft enough to cry
Cause I remember those times
I remember

You can get high on a first kiss
You can get by with sweet tea and Gods graces
You can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
Nothings shatterproof
You can crash and burn and come back someone new
And thats what I learned from you
Saw you just the other day
All that I could think to say was
Hey, how have you been?
You caught me with that old smile
Said, Its really been a while
And I still think about back when
We used to get high on the first kiss
We could get by with sweet tea and Jesus
And you can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
Nothings shatterproof
You can crash and burn and now Im someone new
And thats what I learned from you
Oh, thats what I learned from you
Thats what I learned from you, oh you, oh
Thats what I learned from you, oh yeahEmbed

He said, I got me a nice new apartment
In the city, wouldnt you have hated that?
Im getting by with a broken heart you left me with
He hangs up the phone and she whispers back
Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Wont you come back to me?
Ill be here, today and here tomorrow
In dark blue Tennessee
He was lying when he said he moved to L.A
Hes just hiding out on the other side of town
With his head in his hands and shes just seven miles away
Hes staring out the window and puts her picture down, saying
Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Wont you come back to me?
Ill be here, today and here tomorrow
In dark blue Tennessee
She almost called him on the night that he wrote
These simple words on his goodbye note

Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Wont you come back to me?
Ill be here, today and here tomorrow

Hey Hey, T-Swizzle (T-Swizzle)
T-Pizzle (T-Pizzle)
Im like eight foot fo, blonde hair to the floor
You shorties never thought I dreamed about rapping hardcore
No I aint got a gun, no I never really been in a club
Still live with my parents, but Im still a thug
Im so gangster, you can find me baking cookies at night
You out clubbing but I just made caramel delights
T-Swift and T-Pain rapping on the same track
Its a thug story, tell me can you handle that?
I had a dream last night
I had high top Nikes
I had diamonds in my mouth
And diamonds on my mic
By the time I woke I was singing
Im on a boat, whoa oh-oh
Cause Im a singer turned rapper
Shorty Im a make ya
Straight to the top, yo
Shorty Im a take ya
You can call me T-Sweezy
Now Im a rap star
Hey, Its a thug story
Now tell em who you are
Singer turned gangster
You dont want to fight me
Straight to the top
In my extra small white tee

T-Swift and T-Pain all up on the same track
Its a thug story now can you get with that?
What? What? I knit sweaters, yo!
What? What? Dont test me (beep)!
Hey, hold on...
Hold on, I didnt even say anything
I didnt even s-

Yup
You guys bleeped me and I didnt even say anything
I didnt even swear

I need you now
Read letters that I wrote on the wall
And the message that I left when I called
I need you now
Words I said drowned out by the rain
Waiting there for you, but you never came
My worlds a little colder now
But Im keeping warm somehow
So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I dont need you, dont need you
And I waited, so frustrated
Whos gonna hold you?
I dont need you, dont need you now
I need you now
Words I heard you whisper to me
When we were walking down a one-way street
And you need me now
Thats what youve been telling my friends
But Ive come too far to go back there again
My heart, my mind, and numbers have changed
You might as well forget my name

So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I dont need you, dont need you
And I waited, so frustrated
Whos gonna hold you?
I dont need you, dont need you now
I need you now
Read letters that I wrote on the wall
And the message that I left when I called
So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I dont need you, dont need you
And I waited, so frustrated
So whos gonna hold you?
I dont need you now
And I dont look for your car
I dont wonder where you are
I dont dream about you
Cause I dont need you now
I dont dream about the way
That I never heard you say
I need you, I need you
I dont need you now
Dont need you
I dont need you now3Embed
Wish I had concentrated
They said love was complicated
But its something I just fell into
And it was overrated
But just look what Ive created
I came out alive but Im black and blue
Before you ask me if I’m alright
Think about what I had to do, yeah
Wake up and smell the breakup
Fix my heart, put on my makeup
Another mess I didnt plan
And Ill bet you thought youd beat me
Wish you could only see
I got an I heart question mark
Written on the back of my hand
Id be fine if you just walked by
But you had to talk about why
You were wrong and I was right
But I cant believe you made me
Sit at home, cry like a baby
Wait right by the phone every night

And now you ask about you and I
Theres no you and I
Remember what you put me through, I had to
Wake up and smell the breakup
Fix my heart, put on my makeup
Another mess I didnt plan
And Ill bet you thought youd beat me
Wish you could only see
I got an I heart question mark
Written on the back of my hand
And when youre home all alone at night
Youll still wonder why
You took everything I had, oh, baby
I havent thought about you and I
Theres no you and I
And I know someday you will
Wake up and smell the breakup
Realize that we wont make up
It didnt go the way you planned
And youll know you didnt beat me
When you look down and see
I got an I heart question mark
Written on the back of my hand
Written on the back of my hand
An I heart question mark, yeah
Written on the back of my hand3Embed
I said, remember this moment, in the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age
Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered
I said, remember this feeling
I passed the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there
On the side-lines wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, This is absurd
Cause for a moment, a band of thieves
In ripped up jeans got to rule the world

Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
Im not afraid
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered
Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall
We have absolutely loved spending time in your town, and you have been so amazing to us
I mean, you guys know every single word and you’ve danced this entire night and it means the world to me and every single person you see on stage
Thank you
Will you take a moment?
And Promise me this
That youll stand by me forever
But if, God forbid, fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children some day
When they point to the pictures
Please tell ‘em my name
Tell them how the crowds went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine
Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life, with you
Long, long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
Im not afraid
Singing, long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
Long, long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be rememberedEmbed
Im walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love til it hurts or bleeds
Or fades in time
And I never saw you comin
And Ill never be the same
You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now all we know is dont let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes
So you were never a saint and I loved in shades of wrong
Wе learn to live with the pain, mosaic brokеn hearts
But this love is brave and wild
I never saw you comin
And Ill never be the same

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
Youre my Achilles heel
This is the golden age
Of something good and right and real
And I never saw you comin
And Ill never be the same
Oh, I never saw you comin
And Ill never be the same
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right12Embed
This is a song I did with Jack Antonoff, and Jack is one of my friends and so we were hanging out and he pulled out his phone and goes I made this amazing track the other day. Its so cool, I love these guitar sounds.
And he played it for me and immediately I could hear this finished song in my head, and I just said Please, please let me have that. Let me play with it, like send it to me
And so he sent it to me and I was on tour and this was me playing the track on my laptop recording me singing the vocal into my phone and it ended up being a song called I Wish You Would, because Jack wrote back and said I love that
So this is another way of writing, its writing to track:
Okay so this is an idea called I Wish You Would. Its kind of about this guy whos like, hes driving down the street at the middle of the night and he passes his ex-girlfriends house and its like, he thinks she hates him, but shes still in love with him, very dramatic. This track is sick, hope you like this
Its 2 am, in your car
Windows down, past my street the memories start
Its in the past
You drive straight ahead
You thinking that I hate you now
Cause you still dont know what I never said
I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
Id never forget you as long as I live, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, its all good
I wish you would
Do you like it!?6Embed
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special
Once bitten and twice shied
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby
Do you recognize me
Well, it has been a year, it does not surprise me
Merry Christmas, I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying I love you, I meant it
Now I know what a fool Ive been
But if you kiss me now, I know you would fool me again
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special

A crowded room and friends with tired eyes
I am hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me, I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A girl on a cover but you tore her apart
Maybe this year
Maybe this year I will give it to someone special
Because last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special
And last Christmas
And this year
It wont be anything like, anything like
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special3Embed
Your beautiful eyes
Stare right into mine
And sometimes, I think of you late at night
I dont know why
I wanna be somewhere where you are
I wanna be where
Youre here, your eyes are lookin into mine
So baby, make me fly
My heart has never felt this way before
Im looking through your—
Im looking through your eyes
I wake up, Im alive
In only a little while, Ill cry
Cause youre my lullaby
So baby, come hold me tight cause I
I wanna be everything you need
I wanna be where

Youre here, your eyes are lookin into mine
So baby, make me fly
My heart has never felt this way before
Im looking through your—
Im looking through your eyes
Just as long as youre mine
Ill be your everything tonight
Let me love you, kiss you
Oh, baby, let me miss you
Let me see your, dream about, dream about
Dream about your eyes
Ah, ah
Beautiful eyes2Embed
Hey Apple Music, this is Taylor Swift
Midnights tells the stories of thirteen sleepless nights scattered throughout my life
I hope you like it and, wherever you are, youll meet me at midnightEmbed
Have you ever seen him?
Has he ever pounced on you?
I wonder what he looks like!
Is he purple with red eyes?
I wonder what he likes to eat.
What about his size!!
Tonight Im gonna catch him!
Ill set a real big trap!
Then Ill train him really well.
Hell answer when I clap!
When I looked up in that closet, there was nothing there but stuff.
I know that monsters in there!
I heard him huff and puff!
Could it be he wants to eat me?
Maybe Im his favorite tray.
And if he comes to get me,
Ill scream loudly, Go away!!
If hes nice, Ill name him Happy.
If hes bad Ill name him Grouch.
I suspect that he is leaving, but if not. . .Ill kick him out!3Embed
Stars drawn around scars. A cardigan that still bears the scent of loss twenty years later. Battleships sinking into the ocean, down, down, down. The tree swing in the woods of my childhood. Hushed tones of lets run away and never doing it. The sun drenched month of August, sipped away like a bottle of wine. A mirrored disco ball hovering above a dance floor. A whiskey bottle beckoning. Hands held through plastic. A single thread that, for better or for worse, ties you to your fate.
Pretty soon these images in my head grew faces or names and became characters. I found myself not only writing my own stories, but also writing about or from the perspective of people Ive never met, people Ive known, or those I wish I hadnt. An exiled man walking the bluffs of a land that isnt his own, wondering how it all went so terribly, terribly wrong. An embittered tormentor showing up at the funeral of his fallen object of obsession. A seventeen-year-old standing on a porch, learning to apologize. Lovestruck kids wandering up and down the evergreen High Line. My grandfather, Dean, landing at Guadalcanal in 1942. A misfit widow getting gleeful revenge on the town that cast her out.
A tale that becomes folklore is one that is passed down and whispered around. Sometimes even sung about. The lines between fantasy and reality blur and the boundaries between truth and diction become almost indiscernible. Speculation, over time, becomes fact. Myths, ghost stories, and fables. Fairytales and parables. Gossip and legend. Someones secrets written in the sky for all to behold.
In isolation my imagination has run wild and this album is the result, a collection of songs and stories that flowed like a stream of consciousness. Picking up a pen was my way of escaping into fantasy, history, and memory. Ive told these stories to the best of my ability with all the love, wonder, and whimsy they deserve.
Now its up to you to pass them down.Embed
There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity, shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is, it was enchanting to meet you
Your eyes whispered, Have we met?
Across the room your silhouette
Starts to make it’s way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is, I was enchanted to meet you
This night is sparkling
Dont you let it go
Im wonderstruck
Blushing all the way home
Ill spend forever
Wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

The lingering question kept me up
2AM, who do you love?
I wonder til Im wide awake
And now Im pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
Id open up and you would say, Hey
It was enchanting to meet you
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you (Ooh-ooh)
This night is sparkling
Dont you let it go
Im wonderstruck
Blushing all the way home
Ill spend forever
Wondering if you knew
This night is flawless
Dont you let it go
Im wonderstruck
Dancing around all alone
Ill spend forever
Wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you
This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the storyline ends
My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again
These are the words I held back
As I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you
Please dont be in love
With someone else
Please dont have somebody waiting on you
Please dont be in love with someone else
Please dont have somebody waiting on you
Please don’t be in love with someone else
Please don’t have somebody waiting on you
(Oh)
Please don’t be in love with someone else (Oh-oh)
This night is sparkling
Dont you let it go
Im wonderstruck
Blushing all the way home
Ill spend forever
Wondering if you knew
This night is flawless
Dont you let it go
Im wonderstruck
Dancing around all alone
Ill spend forever
Wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you
Please dont be in love with someone else
Please dont have somebody
Waiting on youEmbed
I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sisters house
And youve still got it in your drawer, even now
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
Were singin in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know its long gone and
That magics not here no more
And I might be okay, but Im not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh
Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red cause you were lookin over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mothers tellin stories bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me bout your past, thinkin your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, Fuck the patriarchy
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin town
And I was thinkin on the drive down, Any time now
Hes gonna say its love, you never called it what it was
Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin its the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

And I know its long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to
Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
Were dancin round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and wed swear
To remember it all too well, oh-oh-oh-oh
And maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
Maybe this thing was a masterpiece til you tore it all up
Runnin scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein honest
Im a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin here
Cause I remember it all, all, all
They say alls well that ends well, but Im in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it wouldve been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin in a party bathroom
Some actress askin me what happened, you
Thats what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin coffee like youre on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin you to come
And he said, Its supposed to be fun turning twenty-one
Time wont fly, its like Im paralyzed by it
Id like to be my old self again, but Im still tryin to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You cant get rid of it
Cause you remember it all too well, yeah
Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing youve ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
And I was never good at tellin jokes, but the punch line goes
Ill get older, but your lovers stay my age
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
Im a soldier whos returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
Cause in this citys barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well
Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well
Just between us, I remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it (All too well)
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it1Embed
I know he loved you a long time ago
I aint jealous of you, just thought you should know
You were never good enough for him or anything like me
So you might as well sit back cause I aint trying to show maturity
X is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker, oh, yeah
Just like the mark you knew you were making
Who do you think you are
To write on his heart in permanent marker?
I found that picture of you in that green dress
He sure had a good time cleaning up that mess
He found thirty other pieces but hell never find them all
Tried to tape it back together, now he knows to keep it off the wall
X is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker, oh, yeah
Just like the mark you knew you were making
Who do you think you are
To write on his heart in permanent marker?
X is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker, oh, yeah
Oh, just like the mark you knew you were making
Who do you think you are
To write on his heart?
X is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker, oh, yeah
Just like the mark that you knew that you were making
Who do you think you are
To write on his heart in permanent marker?

In permanent marker
Oh, permanent marker, yeahEmbed

Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold on to the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I dont feel welcome anymore
What happened? Please, tell me
Cause one second it was perfect
Now youre halfway out the door
And I stare at the phone, he still hasnt called
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, Forever and always
And it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
I was there when you said, Forever and always
Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now Im not so sure
So heres to everything coming down to nothing
Heres to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I dont anymore

And I stare at the phone, he still hasnt called
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
You flashback to when he said, Forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
I was there when you said, Forever and always
You didnt mean it baby, I dont think so
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up
Please, back up, oh, back up
Back up, baby, back up
Cause it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
I was there when you said, Forever and always
And I stare at the phone, he still hasnt called
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
You flashback to when we said, Forever and always
And it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when youre here, it rains when youre gone
I was there when you said, Forever and always
You didnt mean it, baby
You said, Forever and always, yeah8Embed
She walks to school
With her arms crossed
Its just another day
At 10 o clock she hears this screaming
Then finally she sees them
Its scary how things change
And I saw the story on the news
I saw the footage from the roof
I sat down and cried
Didnt she call you
Didnt she need you bad enough
Was there some reason
Im not aware of
Did you not write it down
Just one more thing to do
Where were you
And didnt she pray too
He kissed his wife goodbye
And took the earliest flight
So he could be home that night
To put his kids to sleep
Down the aisle
Three men walked and said
Were here to die for our God
He stood up and said thats funny
Cause my God died for me
I put the magazine down
I read his words out loud
I sat down and cried

And didnt he call you
Didnt he need you bad enough
Was there some reason
Im not aware of
Did you not write it down
Just one more thing to do
Where were you
And didnt he pray to oh
The taxis pulled up
On the very day of
They rode 100 floors up
Just to come back down
They never thought theyd see the day
That the towers up in flames
There was nothing left to say
When it all came down
And didnt they call you
Didnt they need you bad enough
Was there some reason
Im not aware of
Did you not write it down
Just one more thing to do
Where were you
Where were you
And didnt they pray to
Oh
I walk to school
And I wear a cross
Im counting

But what shocked me the most was how often I wrote down the things I loved. Writing a new song, riding in the car with my mom, the purple-pink skies of the soccer field on the walk home, the one night in middle school when none of my friends were fighting, the dazzle of opal necklaces I couldn’t afford gleaming from a department store jewelry case. I wrote about tiny details in my life in these diaries from a bygone age with such... wonderment. Intrigue. Romance. I noticed things and decided they were romantic, and so they were.
In life, we grow up and we encounter the nuanced complexities of trying to figure out who to be, how to act, or how to be happy. Like invisible smoke in the room, we wonder what kind of anxiety pushes you forward and what kind ruins your ability to find joy in your life. We constantly question our choices, our surroundings, and we beat ourselves up for our mistakes. All the while, we crave romance. We long for those rare, enchanting moments when things just fall into place. Above all else, we really, really want our lives to be filled with love.
Ive decided that in this life, I want to be defined by the things I love- not the things I hate, the things Im afraid of, or the things that haunt me in the middle of the night. Those things may be struggles, but theyre not my identity. I wish the same for you. May your struggles become inaudible background noise behind the loud, clear voices of those who love and appreciate you. Turn those voices up in the mix in your head. May you take notice of the things in your life that are nice and make you feel safe and maybe even find wonderment in them. May you write down your feelings and reflect on them years later, only to learn all the trials and the tribulations you thought might kill you... didnt. I hope that someday you forget the pain ever existed. I hope that if there is a lover in your life, its someone who deserves you. If thats the case, I hope you treat them with care.
This album is a love letter to love itself- all the captivating, spellbinding, maddening devastating red, blue, gray, golden aspects of it (thats why there are so many songs).
In honor of fever dreams, bad boys, confessions of love on a drunken night out, Christmas lights still hanging in January, guitar string scars on my hands, false gods and blind faith, memories of jumping into an icy outdoor pool, creaks in floorboards and ultraviolet morning light, finally finding a friend, and opening the curtains to see the clearest, brightest daylight after the darkest night.
We are what we love.
This is Lover.Embed
Everybodys waitin
Everybodys watchin
Even when youre sleepin
Keep your eyes open
The tricky thing
Is yesterday, we were just children
Playing soldiers, just pretending
Dreaming dreams with happy endings
In backyards
Winning battles with our wooden swords
But now weve stepped into a cruel world
Where everybody stands and keeps score
(Keep your eyes open)
Everybodys waitin for you to break down
Everybodys watchin to see the fallout
Even when youre sleepin, sleepin
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open

So here you are
Two steps ahead and stayin on guard
Every lesson forms a new scar
They never thought youd make it this far
But turn around (Turn around)
Oh, theyve surrounded you, its a showdown (Showdown)
And nobody comes to save you now
But you got somethin they dont
Yeah, you got somethin they dont
You just gotta keep your eyes open
Everybodys waitin for you to break down
Everybodys watchin to see the fallout
Even when youre sleepin, sleepin
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes
Keep your feet ready, heartbeat steady
Keep your eyes open
Keep your aim locked, the night goes dark
Keep your eyes open
(Keep your eyes open)
(Keep your eyes open)
(Keep your eyes open)
(Keep your eyes open)
Everybodys waitin for you to break down
Everybodys watchin to see the fallout
Even when youre sleepin, sleepin
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes openEmbed
I dont think that passenger seat
Has ever looked this good to me
He tells me about his night
And I count the colors in his eyes
Hell never fall in love, he swears
As he runs his fingers through his hair
I’m laughing cause I hope hes wrong
And I dont think it ever crossed his mind
He tells a joke, I fake a smile
But I know all his favorite songs
And I could tell you his favorite colors green
He loves to argue, born on the seventeenth
His sisters beautiful, he has his fathers eyes
And if you asked me if I love him
Id lie
He looks around the room
Innocently overlooks the truth
Shouldnt a light go on?
Doesnt he know that Ive had him memorized for so long?
He sees everything in black and white
Never let nobody see him cry
I dont let nobody see me wishin he was mine

I could tell you his favorite colors green
He loves to argue, born on the seventeenth
His sisters beautiful, he has his fathers eyes
And if you asked me if I love him
Id lie
He stands there, then walks away
My God, if I could only say
Im holding every breath for you
Hed never tell you, but he can play guitar
I think he can see through everything but my heart
First thought when I wake up
Is, My God, he’s beautiful
So I put on my makeup
And pray for a miracle
Yes, I could tell you his favorite colors green
He loves to argue, oh, and it kills me
His sisters beautiful, he has his fathers eyes
And if you asked me if I love him
If you asked me if I love him
I’d lie5Embed
Let go of the ones you outgrow
Let go of the words they hurl your way
as youre walking out the door
The only thing cut and dry
In this hedge-maze life
Is the fact that their words will cut
but your tears will dry
They dont tell you this when you are young
You cant hold on to everything
Cant show up for everyone
You pick your poison
Or your cure
Phone numbers you know by heart
And the ones you dont answer any more
Hold on to the faint recognition in
the eye of a stranger
As it catches you in its lustrous net
How quickly we become intertwined
How wonderful it is to forget
All the times your intuition failed you
But it hasnt killed you yet
Hold on to childlike whims and moonlight
swims and your blazing self-respect
And if you drive the roads of this town
Ones youve gone down so many times before
Flashback to all the times
Life nearly ran you off the road
But tonight your hand is steady
Suddenly youll know
The trick to holding on
Was all that letting go3Embed
This night is sparkling, dont you let it go
Im wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
Ill spend forever wondering if you knew
That this night is flawless, dont you let it go
Im wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
Ill spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you
He said lets get out of this town
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds
I thought heaven cant help me now
Nothing lasts forever, but this is gonna take me down
Hes so tall and handsome as hell
Hes so bad but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is
Say youll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say youll see me again even if its just in your
Wildest dreams (ah ah)
Wildest dreams (ah ah)
He said no one has to know what we do
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothing lasts forever
But this is getting good now
Hes so tall and handsome as hell
Hes so bad but he does it so well
And when weve had our very last kiss
My last request is
Say youll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say youll see me again even if its just in your
Wildest dreams (ah ah)
Wildest dreams (ah ah)
Ooh
This night is sparkling
Dont you let it go, dont you let it go
This night is flawless
Dont you let it go, dont you let it go
This night is sparkling
Dont you let it go, dont you let it go
This night is flawless
Dont you let it go
Youll see me in hindsight, tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories follow you around
Youll see me in hindsight, tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories follow you around
Youll see me in hindsight, tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories follow you around
Youll see me in hindsight, tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories follow you around (follow you around)
Say youll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say youll see me again, even if its just pretend
Say youll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say youll see me again even if its just in your
Wildest dreams (ah ah)
Wildest dreams (ah ah)
(Even if its just in your)
Wildest dreams (ah ah)
Wildest dreams (ah ah)
This night is sparkling
Dont you let it go, dont you let it go
This night is flawless
Dont you let it go, dont you let it go
This night is sparkling
Dont you let it go, dont you let it go
This night is flawless
Dont you let it go
In your
Wildest dreams (ah ah)
Wildest dreams (ah ah)
Even if its just in your
Wildest dreams (ah ah)
Wildest dreams (ah ah)3Embed
Last night, I heard my own heart beatin
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Six months gone and Im still reachin
Even though I know youre not there
I was playin back a thousand memories, baby
Thinkin bout everything weve been through
Maybe Ive been going back too much lately
When time stood still and I had you
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said youre sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie, youd be here by now
I know people change and these things happen
But I remember how it was back then
Wrapped up in your arms and our friends are laughin
Cause nothing like this ever happened to them
Now Im pacing down the hall, chasing down your street
Flashback to the night when you said to me
Nothings gonna change, not for me and you
Back before I knew how much I had to lose

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said youre sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie, youd be here by now
If youre out there, if youre somewhere, if youre moving on
Ive been waiting for you every day since youve been gone
I just want it back the way it was before
And I just wanna see you back at my front door
And I say, Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would before you said its not that easy
Before the fight, before I locked you out
But I take it all back now
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said youre sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie, youd be here by now
Youd be here by now
Its not the kind of ending you wanna see now
Baby, what about the ending?
Oh, I thought that youd be here by now
Oh, oh
Thought youd be here by now1Embed
Is it romantic how all my elegies eulogize me?
Im not cut out for all these cynical clones
These hunters with cell phones
Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I dont belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
Im setting off, but not without my muse
What should be over burrowed under my skin
In heart-stopping waves of hurt
Ive come too far to watch some namedropping sleaze
Tell me what are my words worth
Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I dont belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
Im setting off, but not without my muse
I want auroras and sad prose
I want to watch wisteria grow right over my bare feet
Cause I havent moved in years
And I want you right here
A red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground
With no one around to tweet it
While I bathe in cliffside pools
With my calamitous love and insurmountable grief

Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I dont belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
Im setting off, but not without my muse
Not without you
Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I dont belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
Im setting off, but not without my muse
No, not without you2Embed
Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
We caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I dont feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please tell me
Cause one second it was perfect
Now youre halfway out the door
And I stare at the phone, he still hasnt called
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, Forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
I was there when you said, Forever and always
Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest made you run and hide?
Like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute now Im not so sure
So heres to everything coming down to nothing
Heres to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute but I dont anymore

And I stare at the phone, he still hasnt called
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, Forever and always
And it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
I was there when you said, Forever and always
You didnt mean it, baby
I dont think so
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up
Please back up, oh back up
Back up, baby, back up
Cause it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
I was there when you said, Forever and always
And I stare at the phone, he still hasnt called
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when we said, Forever and always
Cause it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
I was there when you said, Forever and always
You didnt mean it baby
You said, Forever and always, yeah5Embed
Me and Britney used to sit on the front porch drinking lemonade
Talking bout things no one else was ever supposed to hear
In the summer shade
She said she was gonna be a movie star
And I said she was crazy
Catching dreams and fireflies in a jar
Just me and Britney
Oh, oh
We were babies, we were beautiful and free
Oh, oh
There was nothing that was out of reach
For me and Britney
She never made it to Hollywood but she made it to Memphis
And this little old town just hasn’t been the same since
That boy she ran off with, well, I thought he was crazy
Maybe I was just jealous that hed come between me and Britney
Oh, oh
She was in love, she was beautiful and free
Oh, oh
She was always so much braver than me

When the phone rang in the middle of the night
Before she said a word I knew it was her
She said I’m sorry for waking you up but I didn’t know who else to call
Or where else to go
Me and Britney sat down on the front porch
Talking about love and how it changes things
Changes people and it changes names and everything but me and Britney
Oh, oh
We’re not as young, but we’re still beautiful and free
Oh, oh
Even when we’re old, we’re still going to be
Me and Britney sitting on the front porch drinking lemonade
Talking about things no one else is ever gonna hear
In the summer shadeEmbed
I said remember this moment, in the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in the stands went wild
We were the Kings and the Queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age
Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered
Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall
And hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground

Theres glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me from the night before, but
Dont read the last page
But I stay when youre lost and Im scared
And youre turning away
I want your midnights
But Ill be cleaning up bottles with you on New Years Day
You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi
I can tell that its gonna be a long road
Ill be there if youre the toast of the town, babe
Or if you strike out and youre crawling home
Dont read the last page
But I stay when its hard or its wrong
Or were making mistakes
I want your midnights
But Ill be cleaning up bottles with you on New Years Day
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you
Please, dont ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
Please, dont ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
Theres glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me forevermore
Dont read the last page
But I stay when youre lost and Im scared
And youre turning away
I want your midnights
But Ill be cleaning up bottles with you on New Years Day
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
And long live (Please, dont ever become a stranger)
The walls we crashed through (Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere)
I had the time of my life (Please, dont ever become a stranger)
With you (Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere)
And long live
The walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life
With you2Embed
Im a laid back
T-shirt, blue jean, mood ring kinda girl
Hey, yeah, whats the word on you?
Lay low
Im a mission rebel, angel devil
Little left of the middle
Sometimes I get temperamental
But here I am, an open book
Turn the page, its all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh, what you get is what you see
Baby, you hold the key
To the diary of me
Im poetry
Complicated, simply stated
Hey, yeah, baby, how about you?
I was born free
Im a cell phone hippie
Are you with me?
When I mess up, I dont get up
I just get down, yeah

But here I am, an open book
Turn the page, its all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh, what you get is what you see
Baby, you hold the key
To the diary of me
Its raining on Sunday
Theres nothin on TV
Yesterday was lonely
Youre the only one who gets me
My mind is like an island
Drifting through the ocean
I cant stop thinkin about you
I bet youre thinkin of me too
Well, here I am, an open book
Turn the page, its all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh, what you get is what you see
Baby, you hold the key

Emily comes home from school
Grabs onto her daddys hand
He says Baby girl, whats wrong with you?
She says Please dont make me go back there again
She said I wish there was some way to make them stop it
So he drives down to that principals office and says
I didnt bring her up so they could cut her down
I didnt bring her here so they could shut her out
I live my whole damn life to see that little girls smile
So why are tears pouring down that sweet face?
She wasnt brought up that way
Emilys home late again
He sees that boy drive away
Oh, but somethings different this time
She doesnt have too much to say
She said He tried but theres just some things I wont do
And through the tears she said I couldnt do that to you
And he said
I didnt bring you up so he could wear you down
Take that innocent heart and turn it inside out
I live my whole damn life to see my little girls smile
So dont let nobody take that away
You werent brought up that way

The phone rings on a rainy night, says Its Officer Tate
He said Sir, theres been an accident
You better come down here right away
A drunken driver missed an overpass
And Emily, shes fading fast
He says God, I didnt bring her up to watch them lay her down
Nearly killed me the day they put her own momma in the ground
Only thing that kept me alive was that little girls smile
So please dont take that away, it wont be easy taking her today
She wasnt brought up that way
He stands over the hospital bed
Emily opens her eyesEmbed
Angelina’s got a pretty face
And really long brown hair
Lives somewhere in some wide open space
I’ve never been there
I guess some people come around and purpose she
But I don’t cause
I have always been a bit reckless
And I am not your typical princess
I’m fine just a bit of a mess
And I’m not perfect you could say
I wasn’t brought up that way
Just watched Stephen run across the field
Watched him catch the ball
He’s got everything you’d wanna be
He’s funny, dark and tall
Watch him run across to Angelina
But I won’t cause
I have always been a bit reckless
And I am not your typical princess
I’m fine just a bit of a mess
And I’m not perfect you could say
I wasn’t brought up that way

Stardom pushed across the line
Tripped over my two feet hey oh yeah
But ain’t it funny how
It all comes out
Isn’t life sweet?
But, I have always been a bit reckless
I am not your typical princess
I’m fine just a bit of a mess
And I’m not perfect you could say, oh-oh
I have always been a bit reckless
And I am not your typical princess
I’m fine just a bit of a mess
And I’m not perfect you could say
I wasn’t brought up that wayEmbed
Today was a fairytale, you were the prince
I used to be a damsel in distress
You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale, I wore a dress
You wore a dark gray t-shirt
You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale
Time slows down
Whenever youre around
Well, can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale, youve got a smile
That takes me to another planet
Every move you make, everything you say is right
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale, all that I can say
Is now its getting so much clearer
Nothing made sense til the time I saw your face
Today was a fairytale
Time slows down
Whenever youre around, yeah
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
Time slows down
Whenever youre around
I can feel my heart
Its beating in my chest
Did you feel it?
I cant put this down
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Long were the nights when
My days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Praying the floor wont fall through again
And my mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine
You paint me a blue sky
Then go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed your rules everyday
Wonderin which version of you I might get on the phone, tonight
Well I stopped pickin up and this song is to let you know why
Dear John, I see it all now that youre gone
Dont you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I shoulda known
Well maybe its me
And my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe its you and your sick need
To give love and take it away
And youll add my name to your long list of traitors
Who dont understand
And I look back in regret how I ignored when they said
Run as fast as you can

Dear John, I see it all now that youre gone
Dont you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong
Dont you think nineteens too young
To be played by your dark, twisted games
When I loved you so?
I shoulda known
You are an expert at sorry
And keeping the lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that youve run dry have tired lifeless eyes
Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches
Before fire could catch me
So dont look now
Im shining like fireworks
Over your sad empty town, yeah-yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Dear John, I see it all now that youre gone
Dont you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I see it all now that youre gone
Dont you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress
Wrote you a song, you shoulda known
Dont you think I was too young?
You shoulda knownEmbed
Beneath the chandelier of stars and atmosphere
Tangled like the roots on the ground
The windows opened up
The wind is blowing and were both not making a sound
Its like Im melting on into you
Give me a reason why we should ever move
And
Tell me
Youll never leave me
And Im not crazy and
This is really happening
That this is really happening
Could this be better?
You write me letters
Though you see me every day
You tend to treat me like
My name is up in lights
It really blows me away
Lock me up in a dark room
And I still cant take my eyes off you

Tell me
Youll never leave me
And Im not crazy and
This is really happening
That this is really happening
All those kisses up against your car
For all those wishes on planes
We thought were stars
Memories like photographs
Oh, baby, here we are
Tell me
Youll never leave me
And Im not crazy and
Oh, this is really happening
Oh, oh, baby
Tell me
Youll always need me
That I drive you crazy
And this is really happening
Oh, that this is really happening
Tell me, oh
Youll always need me

Look at you, look at me
Look at who we could be
I want to know who you are
What you want from the stars
And every time I look at you, I can hardly say a thing
My head starts to spin, and it hits me then
I love you
And every time you look at me, I could go crazy, but I dont
Say it, but I wont
Cause Id rather be alone than lose you
And all I really want to do is be next to you
But Im too tired to fight
And I could tell you now
But baby, never mind
All the time, everyday
Theres nothing I can do, baby, to make it go away
So look at you, and look at me
And think of who we could be
But every time I look at you, I can hardly say a thing
My head starts to spin, and it hits me then
I love you
And every time you look at me, I could go crazy, but I dont
Say it, but I wont
Cause Id rather be alone than lose you

And all I really want to do is be next to you
But Im too tired to fight
And I could tell you now
But baby, never mind
All I really want to say is I need you, babe
But how could you understand?
What happens if you turn away
And everything turns blue and gray?
And I just wish I told you, never mind
And I could tell you now, but baby, never mind
Yeah, oh yeah
I could tell you now, but never mind
Yeah, oh yeah, yeah
And I could tell you now, but never mind1Embed

What do you say, when you just know
That hes the one, and you want to go fast
But hes taking it slow?
And what do you do, when hes next to you
But hes a little bit shy?
Well, heres something you can try
Hey, hey what do you say
We go walking down the river all together?
Its a warm May beautiful day
And I feel like I could
Talk to you forever
With the sun shining bright
It feels just like a day
When everythings going to go just right
I know it will be a sweet memory
For you and me someday
What do you say?
What do you see, when you look in his eyes?
Theres something there
That he cant disguise
No matter how he tries
And what do you feel, when you know its real?
And you cant sit still
If you dont own up, will you?

Hey, hey what do you say
We go walking down the river all together?
Its a warm May beautiful day
And I feel like I could
Talk to you forever
With the sun shining bright
It feels just like a day
When everythings going to go just right
I know it will be a sweet memory
For you and me someday
What do you say?
My imaginations running away
Just dreaming about
What I want you to say
Hey, hey what do you say
We go walking down the river all together?
Its a warm May beautiful day
And I feel like I could
Talk to you forever
With the sun shining bright
It feels just like a day
When everythings going to go just right
I know it will be a sweet memory
For you and me someday

But Im not going to talk about that

I like baking and things that smell like winter
But Im not going to talk about that

But Im not going to say that

You might think Id bring up Joe
The guy who broke up with me on the phone
But Im not going to mention him

Be dating the werewolf from Twilight

Something bad about Kanye
And how he ran up on the stage
And ruined my VMA monologue
But theres nothing more to say

Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he wont see
That I want and Im needing
Everything that we should be
Ill bet shes beautiful
That girl he talks about
And shes got everything that I have to live without
Drew talks to me
I laugh cause its just so funny
That I cant even see
Anyone when hes with me
He says hes so in love
Hes finally got it right
I wonder if he knows hes all I think about at night
Hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
Hes the song in the car I keep singing
Dont know why I do
Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I cant breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be
Shed better hold him tight
Give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know shes lucky cause
Hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
Hes the song in the car I keep singing
Dont know why I do
So I drive home alone
As I turn off the light
Ill put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight
Cause hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who’s got enough for me to break my heart
Hes the song in the car I keep singing
Dont know why I do (Why I do)
Hes the time taken up, but theres never enough
And hes all that I need to fall into
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he wont see3Embed
Im walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love till it hurts or bleeds, or fades in time
And I never saw you coming
And I’ll never be the same
You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannon ball
Now all we know, is don’t let go
We are alone just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes
So you were never a saint
And Ive loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild

And I never saw you coming
And I’ll never be the same
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You’re my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of something good
And right and real
And I never saw you coming
And I’ll never be the same
And I never saw you coming
And I’ll never be the same
This is a state of grace
This is a worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right1Embed
I got a little thing I call self control
Cause I get a little crazy when I let too much go
Love’s a little messy, and you are too
Right now, I’m scared of both of you
I laugh, and I play, and I wasn’t gonna stray
Swore I’d never let a man in my way
You’re the last thing I needed today
And I don’t know
Where I lost control
And couldn’t take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between
Your smile and the way you say my name
I can’t win, so I give in
The more I fight, it just gets stronger
You’re an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
Welcome distraction, welcome distraction
Gone and spilled my coffee tryna get to the phone
Cause it might be you, you just never know
Can’t talk to my friends without you coming up
It’s even kind of cute the way you cuss
I wrote your name down a hundred thousand times
Cause it looks so good right next to mine
You’re the last thing I needed tonight

And I don’t know
Where I lost control
And couldn’t take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between
Your smile and the way you say my name
I can’t win, so I give in
The more I fight, it just gets stronger
You’re an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
Welcome distraction
I’m acting like a girl with nothing to lose
When did I stop caring about anything but you?
And I don’t know
Where I lost control
And couldn’t take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between
Your smile and the way you say my name
I can’t win, so I give in
The more I fight, it just gets stronger
You’re an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
Welcome distraction, welcome distraction
Welcome distraction, welcome distraction, oh, ohEmbed
I walk in the room theres a beautiful sunshine ray
Across the room
Then I hear the phone ring walk to it and I dont know what to say
Hello, good day
But what I do know, is that tonight is gonna be the night, when
He says I love you and I really care about you
When, he says hell hold me in his arms when Im afraid
When, Ill say, oh, Ill say I love him too
And, I care about you, yeah, this aint no charade
Then hell drive me home listenin to the radio
And, he says he really loves me too, hell do anything
Oh, I walk through the door theres a beautiful moonlight shine
Across the room
I crawl into bed thinkin what I did today
With him
But what I do know, is that, I love him too
And the next time I see
Him walking down the street(down the street)
Ill think about this time, that was as beautiful as sunshine, oh
He says I love you and I really care about you
Yeah, he says hell hold me in his arms when Im afraid
And Ill say, I love you too, yeah, I love you
Oh, Ill say, I care about you, yeah, this aint no charade
Then hell drive me home, listenin to the radio
Then, he says, he really loves me and hell do anything

I look in his brown eyes, and see a surprise
Its like a present that you open
Oh, and do you know, oh, do you know
What that surprise is?
Its love
And the next time I see him walking down the streets in his old white T-shirt, Ill always remember
This time, that was as beautiful as sunshine
Oh, oh, oh, sunshine, oh, oh, oh, sunshine
Sunshine, sunshine, was as beautiful as sunshineEmbed
Betty, I wont make assumptions
About why you switched your homeroom, but
I think its cause of me
Betty, one time I was riding on my skateboard
When I passed your house
Its like I couldnt breathe
You heard the rumors from Inez
You cant believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go straight to hell
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
Im only seventeen, I dont know anything
But I know I miss you
Betty, I know where it all went wrong
Your favorite song was playing
From the far side of the gym
I was nowhere to be found
I hate the crowds, you know that
Plus, I saw you dance with him

You heard the rumors from Inez
You cant believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go straight to hell
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
Im only seventeen, I dont know anything
But I know I miss you
I was walking home on broken cobblestones
Just thinking of you when she pulled up like
A figment of my worst intentions
She said James, get in, lets drive
Those days turned into nights
Slept next to her, but
I dreamt of you all summer long
Betty, Im here on your doorstep
And I planned it out for weeks now
But its finally sinkin in
Betty, right now is the last time
I can dream about what happens when
You see my face again
The only thing I wanna do
Is make it up to you
So I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party
Will you have me? Will you love me?
Will you kiss me on the porch
In front of all your stupid friends?
If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?
Will it patch your broken wings?
Im only seventeen, I dont know anything
But I know I miss you
Standing in your cardigan
Kissin in my car again
Stopped at a streetlight
You know I miss youEmbed
Let me know, hows it feel
To be under my skin, wrapped around my heart
Is it like anywhere youve been?
And everything I do, I do it just for you
So why the hell dont you love me?
Why the hell dont you need me like I need you?
Why you so far above me?
Dont you know that theres nothing I wouldnt do?
But I was just a toy, which you destroyed
Stupid boy
I have been looking in, trying to read your mind
Give you the benefit of the doubt, every single time
And then you walk right by, Im screaming out inside
Why the hell dont you love me?
Why the hell dont you need me like I need you?
Why you so far above me?
Dont you know that theres nothing I wouldnt do?
But I was just a toy, which you destroyed
Stupid boy

What happens when you wake up, to see that youve lost?
You take one look at me, cause thats what it cost
I just wanna be everything you need
Cause youre everything to me
So why the hell dont you love me?
Why the hell dont you need me like I need you?
Why you so far above me?
Dont you know that theres nothing I wouldnt do?
But I was just a toy, which you destroyed
Stupid boy
Let me know, hows it feel to be under my skin1Embed
If you had only gotten to me first
If I could write a book on how this hurts
If you could see the way your smile looks to me
If I wasnt scared of the world alone
If I didnt know he loves me so
If I could only find the strength to leave
Youd be with me, so baby
Dont you look in my eyes
I might fall in love
With a beautiful boy
I wish that I could touch
You go I hope you think of me
As the stars fall down and the heavens fade
This girl is begging wait for me
Its so wrong that all I wanna do
Is forget it all and just be with you
I have to go cause he dont know
But the writings on the wall
But here we are in so deep, soaking wet
Jumping in without no safety net
And I dont know what kinda ropes
Would break this kinda fall, so baby

Dont you look in my eyes
I might fall in love
With a beautiful boy
I wish that I could touch
You go, I hope you think of me
As the stars fall down and the heavens fade
This girl is begging wait, wait for me
We cant be together right now
Guess theres no use in trying
But if you look at me right now
Can you tell that Im dying
To hold you
But it would be wrong to
So dont you look in my eyes
I might fall in love
With a beautiful boy
I wish that I could touch
You go I hope you think of me
As the stars fall down and the heavens fade
This girl is begging wait for me
Dont you look now
Dont you look now
I might fall in love
Dont you look nowEmbed
American boy, living life as it goes
Sitting on the fence posts
Living in the lie
American boy, living in the real world
Trying just to get the girl
Trying to survive
The simple things in life are always new
Growing up on Sam Hill avenue
Mama makes her cookies and daddys just
The greatest living hero that ever was
Nothing in the world can ever once destroy
The hope of an American boy
Living off of bar tips, trying for relationships
Looking for the love
Suddenly rise, an American beauty
Suddenly he cheats, sent from above
The simple things in life are always new
Growing up on Sam Hill avenue
Mama makes her cookies and daddys just
The greatest living hero that ever was
Nothing in the world can ever once destroy
The hope of an American boy

American boy, raising little babies
Hearing daddy maybe, Ill be like you
Suddenly life, seems just like a new dawn
Thats grown up, American boy
The simple things in life are always new
Growing up on Grandview avenue
Mama makes her cookies and daddys just
The greatest living hero that ever was
Nothing in the world will ever once destroy
No, nothing in the world will ever once destroy
The hope of an American boy1Embed
I live down the street in a broken down house
And a car up on blocks in the driveway
The moment we meet, there was never a doubt
That we wont forget this Sunday
It starts with a smile, and we walk a few miles
And it all leads to this - our first kiss
All my friends are saying
Girl, what are you thinking?
Youre better off
Youre better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble
Youre better off, youre better off
They can talk forever, they just dont know better
We drive around town in a rusty old truck
Somehow it feels like were flying
Dont want to come down
But they make it so tough
Cause everyone we know is trying
To push us apart hide it down in our hearts
And they get what they want cause youre gone

All my friends are saying
Girl, why are you crying?
Youre better off, youre better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble
Youre better off, youre better off
They can talk forever, they just dont know better
You come to my door
In the pouring rain
We know what we dont have to say
You hand me a rose and a note that says
We dont have to do things their way
All my friends are saying
Girl, what are you thinking?
Youre better off, youre better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble
Youre better off, youre better off
Well, they can talk forever, they just dont know better2Embed
So, were gonna have the band take a little tiny break and Im gonna play you a song that, uh, I wrote this when I was like thirteen years old and just moved to Nashville, and I knew that I wanted to end up making music and on a record label, but I didnt know how I was going to get there. And I wrote this song about it
I dont know what I want, so dont ask me
Cause Im still trying to figure it out
Dont know whats down this road, Im just walking
Trying to see through the rain coming down
Even though Im not the only one
Who feels the way I do
Im alone, on my own, and thats all I know
Ill be strong, Ill be wrong, oh but life goes on
Oh, Im just a girl, trying to find a place in this world
Got the radio on, my old blue jeans
And Im wearing my heart on my sleeve
Im feeling lucky today, got the sunshine
Could you tell me what more do I need
And tomorrows just a mystery, oh yeah
But thats OK
Im alone, on my own, and thats all I know
Ill be strong, Ill be wrong, oh but life goes on
Oh, Im just a girl, trying to find a place in this world

Im alone, on my own, and thats all I know
Ill be strong, Ill be wrong, oh but life goes on
Oh Im alone, on my own, and thats all I know
Cause Im just a girl, trying to find a place in this worldEmbed
You know... You guys have a lot of amazing bands from this part of the world, did you know that?
Now that hes back in the atmosphere
With drops of Jupiter in his hair, hey, hey
He walks like summer and talks like rain
Reminds me that theres time to change, hey, hey
Since his return from the stay on the moon
He listens like spring and he talks like June, hey, hey
Tell me, did you sail across the sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way
To see the lights are faded
And that heaven is overrated?
Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star?
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me
While you were looking for yourself out there?
Now that hes back from that soul vacation
Tracing his way through the constellation, hey, hey
He checks out Mozart while he does Tae-Bo
Reminds me that theres room to grow, hey, hey
Now that hes back in the atmosphere
Im afraid that he might think of me as
Plain ol Jane told a story about a man
Who is too afraid to fly so he never did land

Tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
Did you finally get the chance
To dance along in the light of day
And head back to the Milky Way?
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind?
Was it everything you wanted to find?
And did you miss me
While you were looking for yourself out there?
Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you
Even when I know youre wrong?
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance
Five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had, and me?
Tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
Did you finally get the chance
To dance along the light of day
And head back to the Milky Way?
And tell me, did you fall for a shooting star?
One without a permanent scar?
And did you miss me while
You were looking for yourself?
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na na, oh
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na na, oh
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na na, oh
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na na, oh
Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken

I need you now
Read letters that I wrote on the wall
And the message that I left when I called
I need you now
Words I said drowned out by the rain
Waiting there for you but you never came
My world’s a little colder now
But I’m keeping warm somehow
So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I don’t need you, don’t need you
And I waited so frustrated
Who’s gonna hold you?
I don’t need you, don’t need you now
I need you now
Words I heard you whisper to me
We were walking down a one-way street
You need me now
That’s what you’ve been telling my friends
But I’ve come too far to go back there again

My heart, my mind, and numbers have changed
You might as well forget my name
So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I don’t need you, don’t need you
And I waited so frustrated
Who’s gonna hold you?
I don’t need you, don’t need you now
I need you now
Read letters that I wrote on the wall
And the message that I left when I called
So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I don’t need you, don’t need you
And I waited so frustrated
Who’s gonna hold you?
I don’t need you, don’t need you now
And I don’t look for your car
I don’t wonder where you are
I don’t dream about you cause I don’t need you now
I don’t dream about the way
That I never heard you say:
“I need you, I need you”
I don’t need you now
Don’t need you
Don’t need you nowEmbed

So youre leaving in the morning on the early train
I could say everythings alright
And I could pretend and say goodbye
Got your ticket
Got your suitcase
Got your leaving smile
I could say thats the way it goes
And I could pretend and you wont know
That I was lying
Cause I cant stop loving you
No I cant stop loving you
No I wont stop loving you
Why should I?
We took a taxi to the station, not a word was said
And I saw you walk across the road
For maybe the last time I dont know
Feeling humble
I heard a rumble
On the railway track
And when I hear that whistle blow
Ill walk away and you wont know
That Ill be crying

Cause I cant stop loving you
No I cant stop loving you
No I wont stop loving you
Why should I?
(Even try) Ill always be here by your side
(Why, why, why) I never wanted to say goodbye
(Why even try) Im always here if you change, change your mind
So youre leaving in the morning on the early train
I could say everythings alright
And I could pretend and say goodbye
But that would be lying
Cause I cant stop loving you
No I cant stop loving you
No I wont stop loving you
Why should I?1Embed
Santa baby, slip a sable under the tree, for me
I have been an awful good girl, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight
Santa baby, a 54 convertible, too, light blue
Well I will wait up for you, dear, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight, yeah
Think of all the fun I have missed
Think of all the boys I have not kissed
Next year I could be just as good
If you check off my Christmas list
Santa baby, I want a yacht and really that is not a lot
I have been an angel all year, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight
Santa, honey, there is one more thing I really do need, the deed
To a platinum mine, Santa honey
So hurry down the chimney tonight
Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffanys
I really do believe in you
Let us see if you believe in me

Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing
A ring
And I do not mean on the phone, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight6Embed
I had to catch my breath
When I saw you there across the room, holding her hand
Id have never guessed that starting over would look so good on you
But here I am
Still believing there might come a day
Well pick up where we left off
And by the way your eyes are dancing
Id say the chances of that are getting slim
By the way my hearts still breaking
Its going to take it a while to love again
So many things that I forgot to say
By the way
I shouldve let you know all the ways you made me feel alive
I guess its too late
So Ill just get my coat and make my way into this breezy night
Give you one last wave
Maybe youll drop what youre doing and come over here to say
Im looking good
But by the way your eyes are dancing
Id say the chances of that are getting slim
By the way my hearts still breaking
Its going to take it a while to love again
So many things that I forgot to say

By the way, you still look amazing
And I mustve been crazy to let you get away
By the way, if you ever wondered
Still got the same old number, just in case
I still miss you and I still love you
By the way
By the way, ohEmbed
Lesson 1
I learned to block some of the noise. Social media can be great, but it can also inundate your brain with images of what you arent, how youre failing, or who is in a cooler locale than you at any given moment. One thing I do to lessen this weird insecurity laser beam is to turn off comments. Yes, I keep comments off on my posts. That way, Im showing my friends and fans updates on my life, but Im training my brain to not need the validation of someone telling me that I look 🔥🔥🔥. Im also blocking out anyone who might feel the need to tell me to go die in a hole ho while Im having my coffee at nine in the morning. I think its healthy for your self-esteem to need less internet praise to appease it, especially when three comments down you could unwittingly see someone telling you that you look like a weasel that got hit by a truck and stitched back together by a drunk taxidermist. An actual comment I received once.
Lesson 2
Being sweet to everyone all the time can get you into a lot of trouble. While it may be born from having been raised to be a polite young lady, this can contribute to some of your lifes worst regrets if someone takes advantage of this trait in you. Grow a backbone, trust your gut, and know when to strike back. Be like a snake—only bite if someone steps on you.
Lesson 3
Trying and failing and trying again and failing again is normal. It may not feel normal to me because all of my trials and failures are blown out of proportion and turned into a spectator sport by tabloid takedown culture (you had to give me one moment of bitterness, come on). BUT THAT SAID, its good to mess up and learn from it and take risks. Its especially good to do this in your twenties because we are searching. Thats GOOD. Well always be searching but never as intensely as when our brains are still developing at such a rapid pace. No, this is not an excuse to text your ex right now. Thats not what I said. Or do it, whatever, maybe youll learn from it. Then youll probably forget what you learned and do it again.... But its fine; do you, youre searching.
Lesson 4
I learned to stop hating every ounce of fat on my body. I worked hard to retrain my brain that a little extra weight means curves, shinier hair, and more energy. I think a lot of us push the boundaries of dieting, but taking it too far can be really dangerous. There is no quick fix. I work on accepting my body every day.
Lesson 5
Banish the drama. You only have so much room in your life and so much energy to give to those in it. Be discerning. If someone in your life is hurting you, draining you, or causing you pain in a way that feels unresolvable, blocking their number isnt cruel. Its just a simple setting on your phone that will eliminate drama if you so choose to use it.
Lesson 6
Ive learned that society is constantly sending very loud messages to women that exhibiting the physical signs of aging is the worst thing that can happen to us. These messages tell women that we arent allowed to age. Its an impossible standard to meet, and Ive been loving how outspoken Jameela Jamil has been on this subject. Reading her words feels like hearing a voice of reason amongst all these loud messages out there telling women were supposed to defy gravity, time, and everything natural in order to achieve this bizarre goal of everlasting youth that isnt even remotely required of men.
Lesson 7
My biggest fear. After the Manchester Arena bombing and the Vegas concert shooting, I was completely terrified to go on tour this time because I didnt know how we were going to keep 3 million fans safe over seven months. There was a tremendous amount of planning, expense, and effort put into keeping my fans safe. My fear of violence has continued into my personal life. I carry QuikClot army grade bandage dressing, which is for gunshot or stab wounds. Websites and tabloids have taken it upon themselves to post every home address Ive ever had online. You get enough stalkers trying to break into your house and you kind of start prepping for bad things. Every day I try to remind myself of the good in the world, the love Ive witnessed and the faith I have in humanity. We have to live bravely in order to truly feel alive, and that means not being ruled by our greatest fears.
Lesson 8
I learned not to let outside opinions establish the value I place on my own life choices. For too long, the projected opinions of strangers affected how I viewed my relationships. Whether it was the general internet consensus of who would be right for me, or what they thought was couples goals based on a picture I posted on Instagram. That stuff isnt real. For an approval seeker like me, it was an important lesson for me to learn to have my OWN value system of what I actually want.
Lesson 9
I learned how to make some easy cocktails like Pimms cups, Aperol spritzes, Old-Fashioneds, and Mojitos because…2016.
Lesson 10
Ive always cooked a LOT, but I found three recipes I know Ill be making at dinner parties for life: Ina Gartens Real Meatballs and Spaghetti (I just use packaged bread crumbs and only ground beef for meat), Nigella Lawsons Mughlai Chicken, and Jamie Olivers Chicken Fajitas with Molé Sauce. Getting a garlic crusher is a whole game changer. I also learned how to immediately calculate Celsius to Fahrenheit in my head. (Which is what Im pretty sure the internet would call a weird flex.)
Lesson 11
Recently I discovered Command tape, and I definitely would have fewer holes in my walls if Id hung things that way all along. This is not an ad. I just really love Command tape.
Lesson 12
Apologizing when you have hurt someone who really matters to you takes nothing away from you. Even if it was unintentional, its so easy to just apologize and move on. Try not to say Im sorry, but... and make excuses for yourself. Learn how to make a sincere apology, and you can avoid breaking down the trust in your friendships and relationships.
Lesson 13
Its my opinion that in cases of sexual assault, I believe the victim. Coming forward is an agonizing thing to go through. I know because my sexual assault trial was a demoralizing, awful experience. I believe victims because I know firsthand about the shame and stigma that comes with raising your hand and saying This happened to me. Its something no one would choose for themselves. We speak up because we have to, and out of fear that it could happen to someone else if we dont.
Lesson 14
When tragedy strikes someone you know in a way youve never dealt with before, its okay to say that you dont know what to say. Sometimes just saying youre so sorry is all someone wants to hear. Its okay to not have any helpful advice to give them; you dont have all the answers. However, its not okay to disappear from their life in their darkest hour. Your support is all someone needs when theyre at their lowest point. Even if you cant really help the situation, its nice for them to know that you would if you could.
Lesson 15
Vitamins make me feel so much better! I take L-theanine, which is a natural supplement to help with stress and anxiety. I also take magnesium for muscle health and energy.
Lesson 16
Before you jump in headfirst, maybe, I dont know...get to know someone! All that glitters isnt gold, and first impressions actually arent everything. Its impressive when someone can charm people instantly and own the room, but what I know now to be more valuable about a person is not their charming routine upon meeting them (I call it a solid first 15), but the layers of a person you discover in time. Are they honest, self-aware, and slyly funny at the moments you least expect it? Do they show up for you when you need them? Do they still love you after theyve seen you broken? Or after theyve walked in on you having a full conversation with your cats as if theyre people? These are things a first impression could never convey.
Lesson 17
After my teen years and early twenties of sleeping in my makeup and occasionally using a Sharpie as eyeliner (DO NOT DO IT), I felt like I needed to start being nicer to my skin. I now moisturize my face every night and put on body lotion after I shower, not just in the winter, but all year round, because, why cant I be soft during all the seasons?!
Lesson 18
Realizing childhood scars and working on rectifying them. For example, never being popular as a kid was always an insecurity for me. Even as an adult, I still have recurring flashbacks of sitting at lunch tables alone or hiding in a bathroom stall, or trying to make a new friend and being laughed at. In my twenties I found myself surrounded by girls who wanted to be my friend. So I shouted it from the rooftops, posted pictures, and celebrated my newfound acceptance into a sisterhood, without realizing that other people might still feel the way I did when I felt so alone. Its important to address our long-standing issues before we turn into the living embodiment of them.
Lesson 19
Playing mind games is for the chase. In a real relationship or friendship, youre shooting yourself in the foot if you dont tell the other person how you feel, and what could be done to fix it. No one is a mind reader. If someone really loves you, they want you to verbalize how you feel. This is real life, not chess.
Lesson 20
Learning the difference between lifelong friendships and situationships. Something about were in our young twenties! hurls people together into groups that can feel like your chosen family. And maybe they will be for the rest of your life. Or maybe theyll just be your comrades for an important phase, but not forever. Its sad but sometimes when you grow, you outgrow relationships. You may leave behind friendships along the way, but youll always keep the memories.
Lesson 21
Fashion is all about playful experimentation. If you dont look back at pictures of some of your old looks and cringe, youre doing it wrong. See: Bleachella.
Lesson 22
How to fight fair with the ones you love. Chances are youre not trying to hurt the person you love and they arent trying to hurt you. If you can wind the tension of an argument down to a conversation about where the other person is coming from, theres a greater chance you can remove the shame of losing a fight for one of you and the ego boost of the one who won the fight. I know a couple who, in the thick of a fight, say Hey, same team. Find a way to defuse the anger that can spiral out of control and make you lose sight of the good things you two have built. They dont give out awards for winning the most fights in your relationship. They just give out divorce papers.
Lesson 23
I learned that I have friends and fans in my life who dont care if Im #canceled. They were there in the worst times and theyre here now. The fans and their care for me, my well-being, and my music were the ones who pulled me through. The most emotional part of the Reputation Stadium Tour for me was knowing I was looking out at the faces of the people who helped me get back up. Ill never forget the ones who stuck around.
Lesson 24
Ive had to learn how to handle serious illness in my family. Both of my parents have had cancer, and my mom is now fighting her battle with it again. Its taught me that there are real problems and then theres everything else. My moms cancer is a real problem. I used to be so anxious about daily ups and downs. I give all of my worry, stress, and prayers to real problems now.
Lesson 25
I remember people asking me, What are you gonna write about if you ever get happy? Theres a common misconception that artists have to be miserable in order to make good art, that art and suffering go hand in hand. Im really grateful to have learned this isnt true. Finding happiness and inspiration at the same time has been really cool.
Lesson 26
I make countdowns for things Im excited about. When Ive gone through dark, low times, Ive always found a tiny bit of relief and hope in getting a countdown app (theyre free) and adding things Im looking forward to. Even if theyre not big holidays or anything, its good to look toward the future. Sometimes we can get overwhelmed in the now, and its good to get some perspective that life will always go on, to better things.
Lesson 27
I learned that disarming someones petty bullying can be as simple as learning to laugh. In my experience, Ive come to see that bullies want to be feared and taken seriously. A few years ago, someone started an online hate campaign by calling me a snake on the internet. The fact that so many people jumped on board with it led me to feeling lower than Ive ever felt in my life, but I cant tell you how hard I had to keep from laughing every time my 63-foot inflatable cobra named Karyn appeared onstage in front of 60,000 screaming fans. Its the Stadium Tour equivalent of responding to a trolls hateful Instagram comment with lol. It would be nice if we could get an apology from people who bully us, but maybe all Ill ever get is the satisfaction of knowing I could survive it, and thrive in spite of it.
Lesson 28
Im finding my voice in terms of politics. I took a lot of time educating myself on the political system and the branches of government that are signing off on bills that affect our day-to-day life. I saw so many issues that put our most vulnerable citizens at risk, and felt like I had to speak up to try and help make a change. Only as someone approaching 30 did I feel informed enough to speak about it to my 114 million followers. Invoking racism and provoking fear through thinly veiled messaging is not what I want from our leaders, and I realized that it actually is my responsibility to use my influence against that disgusting rhetoric. Im going to do more to help. We have a big race coming up next year.
Lesson 29
I learned that your hair can completely change texture. From birth, I had the curliest hair and now it is STRAIGHT. Its the straight hair I wished for every day in junior high. But just as I was coming to terms with loving my curls, theyve left me. Please pray for their safe return.
Lesson 30
My mom always tells me that when I was a little kid, she never had to punish me for misbehaving because I would punish myself even worse. Id lock myself in my room and couldnt forgive myself, as a five-year-old. I realized that I do the same thing now when I feel Ive made a mistake, whether its self-imposed exile or silencing myself and isolating. Ive come to a realization that I need to be able to forgive myself for making the wrong choice, trusting the wrong person, or figuratively falling on my face in front of everyone. Step into the daylight and let it go.1Embed
I bet you lie awake at night
Trying to make up your sweet mind
Wondering if youll ever find
Just what you want
A home-town number one
Or a California loaded gun
But you know you only get one
Or thats what you thought
But heres what youve got
I could be your favorite blue jeans
With the holes in the knees
In the bottom of the top drawer
I could be your little beauty queen
Just a little outta reach
Or the girl living next door
Ill be your angel giving up her wings
If thats what you need
Id give everything to be your anything
If you want hard to get
If you want
All you have to do is let me know
If you want a bumpy ride
Or someone with a softer side
Either one will be alright
Just let me know
Cause this is where it goes

Its not like Im giving up who I am for you
But for someone like you its just so easy to do
I could be your favorite blue jeans
With the holes in the knees
In the bottom of the top drawer
I could be your little beauty queen
Just a little outta reach
Or the girl living next door
Ill be your angel giving up her wings
If thats what you need
If thats what you need

I wake up
I stretch out
I wonder what youre doin right now
Yeah I slept, in my makeup again
Tell myself I must be crazy
Thinkin bout him
I find myself something decent to wear
Take the towel out of my hair
About that time, you call me
And Im reminded, without you
Id be a stranger in an all night diner
Waiting for a love to find her
Lonely like a harbor light
Thats never seen a boat
Like a line in an old love letter
No one ever wrote
I go to work
Work all day
Im a walking tape recorder
Of everything you say
Walk to the car, dig out my keys
Start thinkin if you were with anyone but me

Im a stranger in an all night diner
Waiting for a love to find her
Lonely like a harbor light
Thats never seen a boat
Like a line in an old love letter
No one ever wrote
There you are
On the street
Just standing there, waiting on me
I show you, my new shoes
You say you love them
Nd baby without you -
Im a stranger in an all night diner
Waiting for a love to find her
Lonely like a harbor light
Thats never seen a boat
Like a line in an old love letter
No one ever wrote
I wake up
I stretch out
I wonder what youre doin right now1Embed
Please take down the mistletoe
Cause I dont want to think about that right now
Cause everything I want is miles away
In a snow covered little town
My mommas in the kitchen, worrying about me
Seasons greetings, hope youre well
Well Im doing alright
If you were wondering
Lately I can never tell
I know this shouldnt be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when you were mine
Ive been doing fine without you, really
Up until the nights got cold
And everybodys here, except you, baby
Seems like everyones got someone to hold
But for me its just a lonely time
Cause there were Christmases when you were mine
Merry Christmas, everybody
Thatll have to be something I just say this year
Ill bet you got your mom another sweater
And were your cousins late again?
When you were putting up the lights this year
Did you notice one less pair of hands?

I know this shouldnt be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when I didnt wonder how you are tonight
Cause there were Christmases when you were mine
You were mine1Embed
I never trust a narcissist
Oh but they love me...
So I play em like a violin
And I make it look oh-so-easy...
Cause for every lie I tell them, they tell me three
This is how the world works
Now all he thinks about...
...me...
I can feel the flames on my skin
Crimson red paint on my lips
If a man talks shit, then I owe him nothing
I dont regret it one bit, cause he had it coming
They say I did something bad
Then whys it feel so good?
They say I did something bad
But whys it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had
And Id do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good
I never trust a playboy, but they love me
So I fly em all around the world
And I let them think they saved me
They never see it comin, what I do next
This is how the world works
You gotta leave before you get left

I can feel the flames on my skin
He says, Dont throw away a good thing
But if he drops my name, then I owe him nothin
And if he spends my change, then he had it comin
They say I did something bad
Then whys it feel so good?
They say I did something bad
But whys it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had
And Id do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good
It just felt so good
Theyre burning all the witches even if you arent one
They got their pitchforks and proof, their receipts and reasons
Theyre burning all the witches even if you arent one
And its just for fun
Theyre burning all the witches even if you arent one
They got pitchforks and proof, they dont need their reasons
Theyre burning all the witches even if you arent one
So light me up (light me up), light me up (light me up)
Light me up, go ahead and light me up (light me up)
Light me up (light me up), light me up (light me up)
Light me up ohh
Light me up (light me up), light me up (light me up)
Light me up ohh
Light me up (light me up), light me up (light me up)
Light me up ohh
Light me up, light me up, light me up
Go ahead and light me up...
They say I did something bad
Then whys it feel so good?
They say I did something bad
But whys it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had
And Id do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good
Oh, they say I did something bad
Whys it feel so good, good?

I know I’m probably better off on my own
Than lovin a man who didn’t know
What he had when he had it
And I see the permanent damage you did to me
Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic
I wish it wasn’t 4am, standing in the mirror
Saying to myself, you know you had to do it
I know the bravest thing I ever did was run
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye
Like the back of my hand
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
I know I’m probably better off all alone
Than needing a man who could change his mind
At any given minute
And it was always on your terms
I waited on every careless word
Hoping it might turn sweet again
Like it was in the beginning
But your jealousy, oh, I can hear it now
You’re talking down to me like Ill always be around
You push my love away like it was some kind of loaded gun
Oh, you never thought I’d run

Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
I know why we had to say goodbye
Like the back of my hand
And I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
I hold onto this pride because these days it’s all I have
And I gave to you my best and we both know you cant say that
I wish you were a better man
I wonder what we would’ve become
If you were a better man
We might still be in love
If you were a better man
You wouldve been the one
If you were a better man
Yeah, yeah
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
I know why we had to say goodbye
Like the back of my hand
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
(We might still be in love, if you were a better man)
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
I know why we had to say goodbye
Like the back of my hand
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
We might still be in love, if you were a better man
You wouldve been the one
If you were a better manEmbed
Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don’t touch
Out of focus, eye to eye
Till the gravity’s too much
And I’ll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I’d be smart to walk away
But you’re quicksand
This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I, I, I, like it
I can’t decide if it’s a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
And all we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow
But you’re friction
This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
I, I, I, like it
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you, get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should
Think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I would follow you, follow you home
I’ll follow you, follow you home
This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous
I, I, I
I, I, I
I, I, I
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you, get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should
Think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I would follow you, follow you home
I’ll follow you, follow you home
I’ll follow you, follow you home
I’ll follow you, follow you home
I’ll follow you, follow you home

This slope is treacherous
I, I, I, like it1Embed
What if ribbons and bows didnt mean a thing?
Would the song still survive without five golden rings?
Would you still wanna kiss without mistletoe?
What would happen if God never let it snow?
What would happen if Christmas carols told a lie?
Tell me, what would you find?
Youd see that today holds something special
Something holy, not superficial
So heres to the birthday boy who saved our lives
Its something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
So heres something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something more
What if angels did not pay attention to
All the things that we wished they would always do?
What if happiness came in a cardboard box?
Then I think there is something we all forgot
What would happen if presents all went away?
Tell me, what would you find?
Youd see that today holds something special
Something holy, not superficial
So heres to the birthday boy who saved our lives
Its something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
So heres something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something more

We get so caught up in all of it
Business and relationships
Hundred-mile-an-hour lives
And its this time of year
And everybodys here
It seems the last thing on your mind
Is that the day holds something special
Something holy, not superficial
So heres to Jesus Christ who saved our lives
Its something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
But heres something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something
Christmas must be something
Christmas must be something more
Theres gotta be more
Theres gotta be more1Embed

Kind of scared cause
Ive never been on a plane
My mama says that itll be alright
Cause Im going to see my daddy tonight
And she says that
Theres a whole a lot of good people in heaven
And I dont wanna get there too soon
And I know theres a God because I met him
And I see it when Im looking at you
There aint no accidents in what we do
My names Heather
Guess were on the same flight
Dont mind Gracie
She could talk to you all night
Shes finally well enough to travel
Doctor says shes in the clear
Shes been in and out of hospital
Since the beginning of the year

Theres a whole a lot of good people in heaven
And I dont wanna get there too soon
And I know theres a God because I met him
And I see it when Im looking at you
There aint no accidents in what we do
James T. Johnson
Thats her daddys name
Hes been overseas
Itll be a year today
He never talked about being scared over the phone
He just said me and Gracie will come and take him on
Theres a whole a lot of good people in heaven
And I dont wanna get there too soon
And I know theres a God because I met him
And I see it when Im looking at you
There aint no accidents in what we do
And the people that we meet
As we go through the rain
There are no accidents in what we doEmbed
Cause baby, now weve got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what youve done
Cause baby, now weve got bad blood, hey!
Now weve got problems
And I dont think we can solve em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now weve got bad blood, hey!
Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shiny?
Now its all rusted
Did you have to hit me where Im weak?
Baby, I couldnt breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like youre laughing right at me
Oh, its so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I
Cause baby, now weve got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what youve done
Cause baby, now weve got bad blood, hey!
Now weve got problems
And I dont think we can solve em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now weve got bad blood, hey!

Did you think wed be fine?
Still got scars in my back from your knives
So dont think its in the past
These kind of wounds they last and they last
Now, did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal, but this wont
So if you come in my way
Just dont
Oh, its so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I
Cause baby, now weve got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what youve done
Cause baby, now weve got bad blood, hey!
Now weve got problems
And I dont think we can solve em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now weve got bad blood
You shouldve said, No, you shouldve gone home
You shouldve thought twice fore you let it all go
You shouldve know that word, bout what you did with her
Get back to me (Bad blood!)
And I shouldve been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldnt be asking myself, Why?
You shouldnt be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You shouldve said no, baby, and you might still have me
Band-aids dont fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
You live like that, you live with ghosts
Band-aids dont fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
If you love like that, blood runs cold!
Cause baby, now weve got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what youve done
Cause baby, now weve got bad blood, hey!
Now weve got problems
And I dont think we can solve em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now weve got bad blood, hey!
Cause baby, now weve got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what youve done
Cause baby, now weve got bad blood, hey!
Now weve got problems
And I dont think we can solve em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now weve got bad blood, hey!Embed
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
Im standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, Hello
Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, Stay away from Juliet
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, Please dont go
And I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
Ill be waiting, all therеs left to do is run
Youll be the princе and Ill be the princess
Its a love story, baby, just say, Yes
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet cause were dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, Stay away from Juliet
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, Please dont go
And I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
Ill be waiting, all theres left to do is run
Youll be the prince and Ill be the princess
Its a love story, baby, just say, Yes
Romeo, save me, theyre trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but its real
Dont be afraid, well make it out of this mess
Its a love story, baby, just say, Yes
Oh, oh
But I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town
And I said, Romeo, save me, Ive been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I dont know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
Marry me, Juliet, youll never have to be alone
I love you and thats all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
Its a love story, baby, just say, Yes
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Cause we were both young when I first saw you3Embed
I got a lying smile I never put out for you
Cause I guess I never felt like I really needed to
And they say little girls have big dreams
And nothing in the world was gonna come between me and you
And it was a long time coming
I waited half my life just to find someone like you
I spent a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
Not knowing itd be a long time going
They say its better to have lost than never to have loved at all
And I say, whoever said that didnt have too far to fall
And they say little girls are so naive
That wasnt how it was supposed to be with me and you
And it was a long time coming
I waited half my life just to find someone like you
I spend a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
Not knowing it will be a long time going
Ive burned my bridges, had sleepless nights
Washed my sins on the neon lights
And Im still not over you

And it was a long time coming
I waited half my life just to find someone like you
I spend a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
Not knowing it will be a long time going
A long time going
And it will be a long time, long time going
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
It will be a long time, long time going, going
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh1Embed
Hey, its me, leave a message: make it hot
Now, go stand in the corner and think about what you did
The story starts when it was hot and it was summer, and
I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone, and lets hear the applause
She took him faster than you can say Sabotage
I never saw it coming, wouldnt have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from
Shes not a saint and shes not what you think
Shes an actress, woah
Shes better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, woah
Soon, shes gonna find stealing other peoples toys
On the playground wont make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha
She looks at life like its a party and shes on the list
She looks at me like Im a trend and shes so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling, and
She thinks Im psycho cause I like to rhyme her name with things
But sophistication isnt what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
But they didnt teach you that in prep school so its up to me
No amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
(Think about what you did)

Shes not a saint and shes not what you think
Shes an actress, woah
Shes better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, woah
Soon, shes gonna find stealing other peoples toys
On the playground wont make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha
Im just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but havent you heard?
Im just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but I always get the last word
Woah, woah-ah-oh
Come on, come on
Shes not a saint and shes not what you think
Shes an actress, woah (She deserved it)
Shes better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, woah
Soon, shes gonna find stealing other peoples toys
On the playground wont make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge
Do you still feel like you know what youre doing?
Cause I dont think you do, oh
Do you still feel like you know what youre doing?
I dont think you do, I dont think you do
Lets hear the applause
See, you deserve some applause
Cause youre so much better
She took him faster than you could say Sabotage1Embed
She didnt have a reason to go, oh no
She didnt have a reason to stay
Either way she didnt tell anyone about her first ray of sun
She looked at her keys and found a reason to run
And time stands still when youre nowhere bound
But I understand it somehow
If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind?
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
And unfamiliar exit signs?
I just drive on by, just south of knowing why
I didnt really know her that well
But I could tell that her smile was only something to hide behind
She felt so out of touch, because she just felt too much
If you dont know what you want nothings ever enough
And time stands still when youre nowhere bound
Thats where Im headed right now

If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind?
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
And unfamiliar exit signs?
I just drive on by, just south of knowing why
I dont have a plan, I dont have a map
I dont even know if Im ever going back
I dont have a when and I dont have a where
I dont even know if Ill know when Im there
But If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind?
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
And unfamiliar exit signs?
I just drive on by
I just drive on by, drive on, drive on
Drive all night
If I drive on, drive on, drive on
Drive all night, just south of knowing why1Embed
Lets watch the tide chase the waves onto the sand
I wonder if a broken heart can feel the warmth of my hand
And I wonder what a piece of driftwood has seen all through his lifetime
Lets walk away the past through the smokey black nights
Ive seen a million things
Spoke a million words
Now I only want to speak to you
Waiting for the words
Counting every bird
Theres nothing Id rather do
On the smokey black nights
Still through the haze I can make out constellations
Ill make one of you and me as we sit in the sand
And I saw that sunset gleaming as my eyes went wild
Lets walk away the past through the smokey black nights
Ive played a thousand songs
Sang a thousand words
Now I only want to sing to you
Waited on a wire
Staring at the fire
Theres nothing Id rather do
On the smokey black nights

Ive walked a thousand miles
Smiled a thousand smiles
Now I only smile when Im with you
Waiting for the words
Counting every bird
Theres nothing Id rather do
On the smokey black nights
So walk with me as the sweet wind dances
Ill write a song for you and me on the smokey black nights1Embed
Do you remember the day
I leaned up against your car
And it started rolling down the street?
You screamed and ran after it
And tried to open the door
And it ran over your foot
And I was too busy laughing on the ground to see
It would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you
When Im mad at all the lovebirds
Cause they dont know to play our song
I wish that pretty girls couldnt see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
Cause thats where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes along
Do you remember the time we watched Carrie
And you said it reminded you of me?
And I threw the remote at you
And you said my point exactly
And later on that night, under the neon city lights
You paid a homeless guy to sing a song to me

It would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you
When Im mad at all the lovebirds
Cause they dont know to play our song
I wish that pretty girls couldnt see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
Cause thats where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes along
You call me lucky cause I lose everything
But I swear Id be careful with it
If you gave me a ring
It would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you
When Im mad at all the lovebirds
Cause they dont know to play our song
I wish that pretty girls couldnt see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
Cause thats where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes alongEmbed
Summer went away, still, the yearning stays
I play it cool with the best of them
I wait patiently, hes gonna notice me
Its okay, were the best of friends
Anyway
I hear it in your voice, youre smoking with your boys
I touch my phone as if its your face
I didnt choose this town, I dream of getting out
Theres just one who could make me stay
All my days
From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I waited ages to see you there
I search the party of better bodiеs
Just to learn that you never carеd
Youre on your own, kid
You always have been
I see the great escape, so long, Daisy May
I picked the petals, he loves me not
Something different bloomed, writing in my room
I play my songs in the parking lot
Ill run away

From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I called a taxi to take me there
I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that my dreams arent rare
Youre on your own, kid
You always have been

From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I gave my blood, sweat, and tears for this
I hosted parties and starved my body
Like Id be saved by a perfect kiss
The jokes werent funny, I took the money
My friends from home dont know what to say
I looked around in a blood-soaked gown
And I saw something they cant take away
Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned
Everything you lose is a step you take
So, make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it
Youve got no reason to be afraid
Youre on your own, kid
Yeah, you can face this
Youre on your own, kid
You always have been1Embed
Sometimes I wonder how its going to feel
Will my first love be true and real?
Will I be ready when my heart starts to fall?
What will I do when my love comes to call?
And my daddy tells me that I light up his world
Everyday he says, darling youre my best girl
He tried to teach me from the very start
The meaning of love so nobody breaks my heart
Will my love come in a bowl of fire?
Will it be filled with hope and desire?
Will my love come in a pouring rain?
Am I ready for the joy, am I ready for the pain
Am I ready for the boy, am I ready for love
I know Im not a little girl anymore
Cause Im feeling things Ive never felt before
Sweet sensations and anticipations
Calling commotion to my emotions
And I hear the words my daddy said to me
He said be true 2 yourself & keep your spirit free
And love will find you one way or another
Be good to yourself and be good to each other

Its a run around the world
And its moving so fast
Though I want to find
A love thats going to last
A love so strong
That I can withstand
The weight of the world
In the palm of its hand
Will my love come in a bowl of fire?
Will it be filled with hope and desire?
Will my love come in a pouring rain?
Am I ready for the joy, am I ready for the pain
Am I ready for the boy, am I ready for this game
Am I ready for the kiss, am I ready for the stars
Am I ready for the bliss, am I ready for loveEmbed
Im so glad you made time to see me
Hows life? Tell me, hows your family?
I havent seen them in a while
Youve been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why
Because the last time
You saw me is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying Im sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you
Wishing Id realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time
These days, I havent been sleeping
Staying up playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didnt call
Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall

And then the cold came
The dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying Im sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you
Wishing Id realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time
I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear Id love you right
Id go back in time and change it, but I cant
So if the chain is on your door, I understand
But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying Im sorry for that night
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you
Wishing Id realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time
All the timeEmbed
Oh whoa
Oh whoa

You are my love, you are my heart
And we will never, ever, ever be apart
Are we an item? Girl, quit playing
We’re just friends, what are you saying?
Said There’s another, and looked right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time, and I was like

Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no

Ill buy you anything, Ill buy you any ring
And Im in pieces, baby, fix me
And just shake me til you wake me from this bad dream
Im going down, down, down, down
And I just can’t believe my first love won’t be around, and Im like

Like baby, baby, baby no oh
Thought you’d always be mine, mine

Oh, Carolina creeks running through my veins
Lost I was born, lonesome I came
Lonesome Ill always stay
Carolina knows why for years I roam
Free as these birds, light as whispers
Carolina knows
And you didnt see me here
No, they never did see me here
And shes in my dreams
Into the mist, into the clouds
Dont leave
I make a fist, I make it count
And there are places I will never, ever go
And things that only Carolina will ever know
Carolina stains on the dress she left
Indeliblе scars, pivotal marks
Blue as the life shе fled
Carolina pines, wont you cover me?
Hide me like robes, down the back road
Muddy these webs we weave

And you didnt see me here (Mhm)
They never saw me
Oh, Carolina knows why for years theyve said
That I was guilty as sin and sleep in a liars bed
But the sleep comes fast, and Ill meet no ghosts
Its between me, the sand, and the sea
Carolina knows2Embed

Stumble up the porch step
You sat down in the car
Only thirteen blocks across this town
To get to where you are
And that don’t offer me much time
To make up my mind
So I best be driving slow
On my way to letting go
These headlights they just wanna fade
Off into the night
But if they’re half as stubborn as me
They’ll just keep on shining bright
I ain’t ever been one to settle like
The dust does on the dash
Since the feeling ain’t strong
I’ll just move on
And leave this in my past
Once youre gone I know your memoryll
Somehow get the best of me
So I question everything I do
Unsure of turning you away
Wonderin bout how Ill feel the day
I see you find somebody new
So I’ve been holding on
Way too long
But not another minute
Im gonna miss you bad but
Can’t call it love if you ain’t in it

Red light turns to green
Then back to red again
I wish there were some other travelers out here
To slow my travelling
Even though the wheel rolled on
Inside I still don’t know
Oh and it troubles me so, oh
Once youre gone I know your memoryll
Somehow get the best of me
So I question everything I do
Unsure of turning you away
Wonderin bout how Ill feel the day
I see you found somebody new
And I’ve been holding on
Way too long
But not another minute
I might miss you bad but
Can’t call it love if you ain’t in it
Once youre gone I know your memoryll
Somehow get the best of me
So I question everything I do
Unsure of turning you away
Wonderin bout how Ill feel the day
I see you find somebody new
So I’ve been holding on
Way too long
But not another minute
Im gonna miss you bad but
Can’t call it love if you ain’t in it
Your car comes to a rest in the drive
You open up the door and I see you smileEmbed
It was something like a perfect start to this love yesterday
But now who are you?
I thought I knew
Your eyes happen now to look right through me
It’s like you forgot the words you whispered to me
They werent true
Its like it wasnt you
Could you tell me what did I do?
Because it cant be were already through
Did you sell me out for a fool after you held me?
Was that just what you do?
What did you need from me?
Tell me
Take time to realize
I know that people change their minds
But that was something I wished you would say to my face
But you ran away
Could you tell me what did I do?
Because it cant be were already through
Did you sell me out for a fool after you held me?
Was that just what you do?
What did you need from me?
Tell me

If I had a reason or a simple goodbye
Baby, even a lie
Yeah, yeah
Tell me what did I do
Cause, baby, suddenly were already through
Did you sell me out for a fool after you held me?
Was that just what you do?
What did you need from me?
And tell me
And tell me
Oh-oh-oh, oh-yeah
And tell me
Tell meEmbed

Heavenly hosts sing Hallelujah

Loves pure light
Radiant beams from thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus Lord at thy birth
Jesus Lord at thy birth

I loved you for a little, a little while
I think you know that!
It would have worked for a little
Except for that day you...
Its not like you to be here
When you said you wont!
But in the pouring rain
You changed everything
You changed the tune!
In the middle of the game
You changed everything
You changed the rules!
Its not like we could forget something quickly
Except in the pouring rain
It kills me to say this
It really does, it kills my heart!
But I might still love you
Reason were just fallen apart
But its not like me to answer
Gonna change my mind!

But, in the pouring rain
You changed everything
You changed the tune!
In the middle of the game
You changed everything
You changed the rules!
And its not like we could forget something quickly
Except in the pouring rain
Oh, am I...
All I torn myself I would be losing!
But in the pouring rain, can you feel my pain?
My tears are falling down from the sky!
In the pouring rain, I can feel...
I wonder who you love tonight
Oh, in the pouring rain
In the pouring rain
Oh, in the pouring rain!
In the pouring rain
You changed everything
You changed my mindEmbed
All is quiet in the world tonight
Catching stars and fireflies
The summer sings a lullaby
With just me and my baby
On the hood of his daddys car
Pass around his old guitar
Bet mamas wondering where we are
Its just me and my baby
The world is spinning round
Cause look just what Ive found
Ooh, lifes so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just want to stay right here
Cause nothings quite like being with my baby
Driving home by the river side
Wishing I could slow down time
Taking pictures in my mind
Both me and my baby
The car pulls up and Im home too late
We didnt take that interstate
Back roads was a better way
For me and my baby
The closer that we get
Oh, I cant leave yet

Ooh, lifes so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just want to stay right here
Cause nothings quite like being with my baby
Look at what weve found
So turn that car around
Ooh, lifes so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just want to stay right here
Ooh, hanging with my baby
Hanging with my baby, my babyEmbed

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sisters house
And youve still got it in your drawer, even now
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
Were singin in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know its long gone and
That magics not here no more
And I might be okay, but Im not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh
Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red cause you were lookin over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mothers tellin stories bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me bout your past, thinkin your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, Fuck the patriarchy
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin town
And I was thinkin on the drive down, Any time now
Hes gonna say its love, you never called it what it was
Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin its the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

And I know its long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to
Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
Were dancin round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and wed swear
To remember it all too well, yeah
Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece til you tore it all up
Runnin scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein honest
Im a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin here
Cause I remember it all, all, all
They say alls well that ends well, but Im in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it wouldve been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin in a party bathroom
Some actress askin me what happened, you
Thats what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin coffee like youre on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin you to come
And he said, Its supposed to be fun turning twenty-one
Time wont fly, its like Im paralyzed by it
Id like to be my old self again, but Im still tryin to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You cant get rid of it
Cause you remember it all too well, yeah
Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing youve ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
And I was never good at tellin jokes, but the punch line goes
Ill get older, but your lovers stay my age
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
Im a soldier whos returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
Cause in this citys barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well
Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it all too well (Just between us)
They say alls well that ends well, but Im in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it wouldve been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin in a party bathroom
Some actress askin me what happened, you
Thats what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin coffee like youre on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin you to come
And he said, Its supposed to be fun turning twenty-one
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was thereEmbed

Taylor Swift is on top of the world, but has she done some sketchy things to get there?
Thirteen celebs who have issues with Taylor Swift
I felt like she was a little angry
Number thirteen
There she is leaving a restaurant
She holds too many grudges
Why did Taylor Swift-
You can see her feet at the very bottom, and can see her making her way into the car
I can understand trying to keep your relationship to yourself at the beginning, or needing to take some time to work on your craft
But come on!
And Taylor, voluntarily bringing attention to herself of her donations
What Swift did is not enough
Yeah, okay Tay, Whatever you say
I, I hate to say this, but I think Taylor Swift is learning a few lessons in life
All this drama is exhausting
Taylor Swift should focus on making the rest of reputation
Reputation
What it is-
Reputation
Taylor Swifts new romance is heating up

And what has happened to the squad

But at the same time, I think both-

Im dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
Im dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

Im dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
So may your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white2Embed
I poured the wine
I gave you all of my time
I patched your dents
Smiled at your friends
Which apparently is a crime
I gave you space
You took my place
And gave it to her
But lifes too long
To waste it all loving a liar
And when love hands me matches now
Im gonna burn it down
I keyed her car
Got my guitar
And wrote this damn song
Look what youve found
Shes been around
I hear the lines long
And dont you tell me
To be nice
Im not a nice girl
She died from complications
Of the things you told her
So when love hands me matches now
Im gonna burn it down
Aint it funny
You said honey
You meant sitting duck
Well I say, cheater, liar, truck on fire, loser, leaver, deceiver
Just a few Ive thought of
And when love hands me matches now
Gonna burn it down
Im gonna burn it down
Oh yeah
Gonna burn it, burn it, burn it down
Matches, nowEmbed
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
Im standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, Hello
Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, Stay away from Juliet
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, Please, dont go, and I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
Ill be waiting, all theres left to do is run
Youll be the prince and Ill be the princess
Its a love story, baby, just say Yes
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, cause were dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, Stay away from Juliet
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, Please, dont go, and I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
Ill be waiting, all theres left to do is run
Youll be the prince and Ill be the princess
Its a love story, baby, just say Yes
Romeo, save me, theyre trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but its real
Dont be afraid, well make it out of this mess
Its a love story, baby, just say Yes
Oh, oh
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town
And I said, Romeo, save me, Ive been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I dont know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
Marry me, Juliet, youll never have to be alone
I love you, and thats all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
Its a love story, baby, just say Yes
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Cause we were both young when I first saw you1Embed
I heard a song tonight on the radio
Another girl sings about a boy
Just sees his face in every space in every room
And I know that if I turn around you wont be there
If I close my eyes will you be there?
I dont want to lose your face
And I dont want to wake one day
And not remember what time erased
And I dont want to turn around
Because I’m not scared
Of what love gave me and took away
And I dont want to lose your face
Ive got a picture of you in my bedroom
And I hope it never falls
And I hope I never lose that feeling
I used to get when you would call
And now I wonder to myself
Who were you and where are you?
Were you ever here at all?
I dont want to lose your face
And I dont want to wake one day
And not remember what time erased
And I dont want to turn around
Because I’m not scared
Of what love gave me and took away
And I dont want to lose your face

That girl in the song had it so good
I wish I could close my eyes and see you
I wish the sky had your face
And the oceans had your eyes
And the sunset had your lips
And I had you
I dont want to lose your face
And I dont want to wake one day
And not remember what time erased
And I dont want to turn around
Because I’m not scared
Of what love gave me and took away
And I dont want to lose your face1Embed
So the clip that youre about to hear is my preparation for a writing session. I was writing with two writers I hadnt ever worked with before, so I wanted to come in with an idea that was pretty much all there, melody and lyrics. And so I had this idea called I Forgot That You Existed, and I wanted it to be really simple. I thought it might be a really fun way to open the album, like, basically kind of shrugging off a lot of things that youve been through that have been causing a lot of struggle and pain and just, one day, you wake up and you realize youre indifferent to whatever caused you that pain. And so this is a clip of me just trying to tinkering around on the piano, trying to figure out exactly what I wanted to do with it, and you can hear the end result on the album, but this is where it started
I forgot that you existed
Thought Id miss you but I didnt
And it was so nice
(Humming)
I forgot that you existed
I forgot that you existed
Thought Id miss you but I didnt
And it was so nice
I forgot that you existed
How Id miss you but I didnt
And it was so nice
So peaceful and
How many nights I, how you did me
How many days did I wait thinking
Bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong?
(Humming)
I forgot that you existed
I thought Id miss you but I didnt
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed1Embed
Shes real pretty if you’re into that brunette
Looks good without any makeup on
Green eyes kind of thing
Uh huh
Shes spontaneous, she aint afraid of anything
She’s not the jealous type
Shes the type you give a diamond ring
And I came along, just after she walked out
Picking up the pieces til Ive figured out
Theres a girl that you want
Shes everything that I am not
And you cant stop thinking about her
Theres a thin little line
And it’s like you cross it every time
When you can’t stop thinking about her
She came from a really small town
She liked to watch football with you
Well, Id learn football too, if you wanted me to
Uh huh
She’s really good with babies, shed be a great mother
She said I should really meet her sometime
Uh huh

Its getting old, I wonder if youve seen
The favorite conversation’s killing me
Theres a girl that you want
Shes everything that I am not
And you cant stop thinking about her
Theres a thin little line
And its like you cross it every time
When you cant stop thinking about her
Dont you know I was a 4.0 in school?Embed
I cant believe you did it again
Walked by and took my heart with you
Why did you have to look so good?
Dont you know that Im trying to hate you
Trying to have a dream without you in it
But how can I put out this fire
When youre the one who lit it
I cant wait for the day I stop pretending
That Im really OK when Im not
I want to know how it feels to be
Over you for real
Until I do
Ill keep writing songs about you
Ive got a stack of papers so high
And its all about you baby
Keep thinking maybe I
Can make sense of something crazy
Something I cant get out of my Head
I write your name I write your name
Then I tear it all to shreds

I cant wait for the day I stop pretending
That Im really OK when Im not
I want to know how it feels to be
Over you for real
Until I do
Ill keep writing songs about you
And if you ever change your mind
And want me back again
I hope these songs will remind me
Why I shouldnt let you in
I cant wait for the day I stop pretending
That Im really OK cause Im not
I want to know how it feels to be
Over you for real
Until I do
Ill just wait for the day
I stop pretending
That Im really OK when Im not
I want to know how it feels to be over you for real
Till I do
Ill keep writing songs about youEmbed
I drive around this town
In a Mustang with the top down
And six running horses under my hood
Well that’s good enough for me
Don’t need the real thing
That’s just another thing
For me to try to tame
Don’t know if I could
It might just break me
I thought there for a little while
Every sunset I’d be riding off with him
Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
That’s the closest you’ll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
That’s the closest to a cowboy
You’ll see me
Before I met him
I was so sane and grounded
Before he taught me how to lie
And crawl out the window
I learned the dirt roads
And I got my heart broken
Cause that cowboy taught me how to cry
And how to let go
I thought there for a little while
Every sunset I’d be riding off with him

Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
That’s the closest you’ll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
That’s the closest to a cowboy
You’ll see me
It was all a little
Wonderful and strange
But I’ll never look
At a sunset the same night
Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
That’s the closest you’ll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
Sitting fishing by the river bank
Swimming in the water tank
That’s the closest you’ll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
That’s the closest to a cowboy
You’ll see meEmbed
If you love me then I love you, swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enough
Id like to keep you til Im old, but if I cant, at least youll know
That, baby, perfect have I loved
Do you remember the stupid things we used to do?
Before September stole me away from you?
The time we got your truck stuck in the creek?
Cause, baby, roads werent wild enough for you and me, sayin
If you love me then I love you, swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enough
Id like to keep you til Im old, but if I cant, at least youll know
That, baby, perfect have I loved
I used to see you by the bridge we used to cross
I found the feeling of trying to get lost
You would smile that smile that I tried so hard to forget
Its hard to douse a fire that I still havent put out yet
And if you love me then I love you, swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enough
Id like to keep you til Im old, but if I cant, at least youll know
That, baby, perfect have I loved

Love was all we knew, and faith was growing on the vines
Words were all we had, and for one summer, you were mine
Sayin
If you love me then I love you, swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enough
Id like to keep you til Im old, but if I cant, at least Ill know
That, baby, perfect have I lovedEmbed
Theres a little girl in this little town
With a little too much heart to go around
Live forever, never say never
You could do better, thats what she says
Mama named her Lucky on a starlit night
A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite
Of the fact that shes different
And yet shes the same
And she says, Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Lucky you, lucky you
She sings her little song, she walks along
A little pathway headed for the skies
Left to travels, lives they unravel
Mind over matter, thats what she says
Mama named her Lucky on a starlit night
A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite
Of the fact that shes different
And yet shes the same
And she says, Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Lucky you, lucky you, lucky you

Maybe shell sing you do-do-do-do
Maybe shell bring you into the skies
Honey, shell love you, funny how some view
Angels above you arent so far away
Mama named her Lucky on a starlit night
A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite
Of the fact that shes different
And yet shes the same
And she says, Lucky you, lucky youEmbed
You walk in here with your guitar man
Your shiny boots and your full-on band
A smile on your face, a knife in your hand
Singing songs youve got memorized
With whatever talent money buys
So polished that it slips right through your hands
But dont worry yourself, I ain’t your competition
Dont flatter yourself, that was never my intention
I want to talk about what you are that I ain’t
Lets talk about what you do that I cant
Lets talk about me and you
And that empty room and who wins
Lets talk about what you did to get here
Lets talk about blood, and sweat, and tears
Lets talk about what you want to be
And who Ive always been
I walk in here with a beat-up case
The same guitar Ive always played
And the words I wrote down on a page
When I was 12 years old and small town raised
You tell the crowd youre paying dues
I tell them, This is what I do
And it’s what I put my life into
As I breathe the smoke and cheap perfume

And say, life on musical road is rough conditions
But the easy ride was never my ambition
I want to talk about what you are that I ain’t
Lets talk about what you do that I cant
Lets talk about me and you
And that empty room and who wins
Lets talk about what you did to get here
Lets talk about blood, and sweat, and tears
Lets talk about what you want to be
And who Ive always been, oh
Lets talk about your childhood days
You were the prom queen, I was on this stage
So wheres that crown gotten you these days
When its me and you and the same damn games?
So what have you got that I aint?
And what do you do that I cant?
Lets put me and you in an empty room
And see who wins
Lets talk about what you did to get here
Lets talk about blood, and sweat, and tears
Lets talk about who you want to be, girl
And who Ive always been (Who Ive always been)3Embed
You were what I wanted
When I wanted what I just couldnt have
You were country lovin
Really somethin for three months and a half
Everybody said that you were bad news
But, baby, I was betting on you
So I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big country serving of payback
I guess Im gonna have to listen to my mamas I told you so
But you aint worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack
I said, Let them say were crazy
You said, Lets go fishing tonight
The midnight moon was blazing, baby
I was looking into your eyes
Everything changed when you took me to town
Caught you staring every other girl down
So I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big country serving of payback
I guess Im gonna have to listen to my mamas I told you so
But you aint worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack

Cant believe the time you lost me
Cant believe what it cost me
I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big country serving of payback
Had to go and listen to my mamas I told you so
You aint never been through that
You aint worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack
You aint worth all that, ten dollars and a six packEmbed
Someone struck a match against the night
All I could see was you and I
I was captivated
A perfect little dream inside my head
And then reality crept in, and erased it
For a while I thought that I could hold you
But you were just a temporary high
Firefly you drew me to you
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
And you dont know it, do you?
I wish I could keep you firefly
Firefly
Something so beautiful and free
Was as never meant to be caged in
I thought I had you in my hand
I tried to catch you, but I cant
Chase the wind
And just as I reach out to touch you
I remind myself you were meant to fly

Firefly you drew me to you
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
And you dont know it, do you?
I wish I could keep you firefly
Firefly
I like to think Id be all that you wanted
Not even that is enough
Firefly you drew me to you
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
And you dont know it, do you?
I wish I could keep you firefly

Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
But I knew you
Dancin in your Levis
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someones bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite
A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and
Giving me your weekends, I
I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes, I
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someones bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite
To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now Im bleedin
Cause I knew you
Steppin on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy, I
I knew you
Leavin like a father
Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing
But I knew youd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew youd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew Id curse you for the longest time
Chasin shadows in the grocery line
I knew youd miss me once the thrill expired
And youd be standin in my front porch light
And I knew youd come back to me
Youd come back to me
And youd come back to me
And youd come back
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someones bed
You put me on and said I was your favoriteEmbed
My momma stood across the room
Face to face but never eye to eye
Recalling words we said
The battle that we swore
Wed never fight
Breaking pieces off with every lie
A tear came to her eye
And she said
Dont walk away now
And dont rip my heart out
Dont you block me out tonight
Honey where are you?
And dont hate me for loving you
He walked around my life
And made blind
With every single move
He caught me staring at him
Mad about him
Little that I knew
Love is different
When you play the fool
And all I want to do is say

Dont walk away now
And dont rip my heart out
Dont you make cry tonight
Like you always do
And dont hate me for loving you
I slammed the door
Sat on the floor
Cried into my bed
Said are you there?
Do you even care?
To cross above my head
But someone said
Dont turn away now
And dont rip my heart out
Things are meant to happen like this
I know its right for you
And dont hate me for loving you
I looked up at the sky
Face to face and finally
Eye to eye1Embed
Shes looking in the mirror
The moments getting nearer
She thinks about it as she walks her walk
Up and down the staircase
Make up fresh on her face
She thinks about it as she talks her talk
School dance, first chance
Always been a dreamer
Theres one guy, shes shy
Sees him through the mirror
And everybody looks at her
She thinks about it
Blue dress, angel face
Looking in the mirror
Shoes, purse, hair tied back
And you should see her
Shes got her magic
Floating through the air
Peace, love
One thing leads into another
Dream big, aim small
Man you got to love her
Shes got her hopes up
Got them up to there
Wondering what to wear

Shes standing in her bedroom
Hell be pulling up soon
She thinks about it when she sees headlights
Looking out the window
Shes got her diary to show
That shes been waiting for this all her life
First date, cant wait
Looking in the mirror
Heart all wrapped up
Wait until he sees her
Hes looking right at her
She thinks about it
Sixteen blue jeans, Abercrombie T-shirt
Shoes, purse, hair tied back
And you should see her
Shes got her magic
Floating through the air

The years went by
The mirror saw her cry
She got up again
She got up again
The wind blew by
The small town lights
She got up again
Move out, find out
Where the world can take her
Bright lights, late nights
Living for the greater
Move to Paris
Living on a prayer
Peace, love
One thing leads into another
Dream big, aim small
Man you got to love her
Shes got her hopes up
Got them up to there
Shes got her hopes up
Got them up to there
Wondering what to wear
Oh, oh, oh
Wondering what to wearEmbed
Walked into a chair leg
As I was thinkin bout you
Your face jumped right in my way
As things lately do
Oh baby cant you see
The thought of you makes a mess of me
Walked into a chair leg
As I was thinkin bout you
And Now I
Cant walk straight
Cant talk straight
Cant think about anything but the way
It should be
It could be
And till you come round again Ill be
Doin what I usually do
Thinkin bout you
Oh, ah
I get lost when I drive around town
Thinkin bout your smile
Always endin up
Your side of town
And I dont know why
Must be somethin under this hood
Nobodys strong like you
Walked into a chair leg
As I was thinkin bout you

Cant walk straight
Cant talk straight
Cant think about anything but the way
It should be
It could be
And till you come round again Ill be
Doin what I usually do
Thinkin bout you
Your eyes are the color of
The great big sea
The one I go swimmin in
Every time you look at me
Cant walk straight
Cant talk straight
Cant think about anything but the way
It should be
It could be
And till you come round again Ill be
Doin what I usually do
Thinkin bout you
Walked into a chair leg
As I was thinkin bout youEmbed
Here I am, once again
In your driveway, thinking I should be leaving
I should go but its so entertaining watching you breathing
You went and got to me like
The stupid song on the radio that you try to forget
But it sticks in your head
So goodbye, its not goodnight
Cause Ill be seeing you in my dreamin
Boy, you got me like a shot to the heart
Got me shakin so bad, spilled my coffee in the car
Caught a red light I ran right through
Gotta call my friends, tell them all about you
Always looking like one of those nights
When youre thinkin bout kissing til the morning light
You got me, you do
In a daze, pull the shades
Close my eyes and picture you at my window
I relax, I go back to all the things you said
That only I know
Boy, you got me like a shot to the heart
Got me shakin so bad, spilled my coffee in the car
Caught a red light I ran right through
Gotta call my friends, tell them all about you
Always looking like one of those nights
When youre thinkin bout kissing til the morning light
You got me, you do

Im runnin right out to my car
And I pull out the drive
Its only been ten minutes
But I have to see you one more time
Boy, you got me like a shot to the heart
Got me shakin so bad, spilled my coffee in the car
Caught a red light I ran right through
Gotta call my friends, tell them all about you
Always looking like one of those nights
When youre thinkin bout kissing til the morning light
You got me, you doEmbed
One daybreak, one heartache
Every once upon a time
That black dress, happiness
Bubble baths and quarter lines
They mean so much to everyone
But you count them up one by one
Clear midnights and this spotlight
Once thinking that your dad was ten feet tall
A blue bonnet, a braid on it
Quiet winters and leaves that always fall
Your black boots, my red flower ring
Live for the little things
Oil paintings and making
Every detail turn out bad
One last stands, new romance
Living for that love and person
They mean so much to everyone
But you count them up one by one

Clear midnights and this spotlight
Once thinking that your dad was ten feet tall
A blue bonnet, a braid on it
Quiet winters and leaves that always fall
Your black boots, my red flower ring
Live for the little things
Ohh, yeah
Ohh
No fighting, black riding
Wish upon a star and give the moon a smile
Pretending, defending
Take a risk and go along for the ride
Strawberries and fairies with wings
Live for the little things
Na na na...
Oh, yeah
Na na na...
Ohh, yeah
Na na na...Embed
I know weve got a lot to say
Between now and forever
But Id be a game if you would play
And my dear you get better
All throughout the day
You smile and walk away
All I can think to do
Is follow you
If you leave Ill be crawling back for more
If you need love Ill be standing at your door
Ill be sick inside if baby youd be my cure
Wherever you think I am tonight
Just know were miles from a heartbreak
Because in the blink of a pretty brown eye
Ill be right where you are baby
Sometime along the way you take my breath away
Distracted by he view
I fall right into you

And if you ever leave Ill be crawling back for more
And if you ever need love Ill be standing at your door
Ill be sick inside if baby you would be my cure
They say I need to see all the people out there waiting
But you take one look at me
And I know the mistake Id be making
Becasue if you ever leave Ill be crawling back for more
And if you ever need love Im standing at your door
Ill be sick inside if baby you be my cure
I know weve got a lot to say between now and foreverEmbed
The drought was the very worst
Oh-oh, oh-oh
When the flowers that wed grown together died of thirst
It was months and months of back and forth
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm
The rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, thats when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
I think I am finally clean
I said, Remember this moment in the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in the stands went wild
We were the kngs and the queens
And they read off our names
The night we danced like we knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, Long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders, Im not afraid
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, Long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered
Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall
And hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
Theres glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me from the night before, but
Dont read the last page
But I stay when youre lost and Im scared
And youre turning away
I want your midnights
But Ill be cleaning up bottles with you on New Years Day
You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi
I can tell that its gonna be a long road
Ill be there if youre the toast of the town, babe
Or if you strike out and youre crawling home
Dont read the last page
But I stay when its hard or its wrong
Or were making mistakes
I want your midnights
But Ill be cleaning up bottles with you on New Years Day
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you
Please, dont ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
Please, dont ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
I love you guys so, so, so, so, so much
Theres glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me from the night before, but
Dont read the last page
But I stay when its hard or its wrong
Or were making mistakes
I want your midnights
But Ill be cleaning up bottles with you on New Years Day
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
And long live (Please, dont ever become a stranger)
The walls we crashed through (Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere)
I had the time of my life (Please, dont ever become a stranger)
With you (Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere)
And long live
The walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life
With you1Embed
I spy with my little tired eye
Tiny as a firefly
A pebble that we picked up last July
Down deep inside your pocket
We almost forgot it
Does it ever miss Wicklow sometimes?
Ooh, ooh
They said the end is comin
Everyones up to somethin
I find myself runnin home to your sweet nothings
Outside, theyre push and shovin
Youre in the kitchen hummin
All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin
On the way home
I wrote a poem
You say, What a mind
This happens all the time
Ooh, ooh
Cause they said the end is comin
Everyones up to somethin
I find myself runnin home to your sweet nothings
Outside, theyre push and shovin
Youre in the kitchen hummin
All that you ever wanted from me was nothin

Industry disruptors and soul deconstructors
And smooth-talking hucksters out glad-handing each other
And the voices that implore, You should be doing more
To you, I can admit that Im just too soft for all of it
Ooh
They said the end is comin
Everyones up to somethin
I find myself runnin home to your sweet nothings
Outside, theyre push and shovin
Youre in the kitchen hummin
All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin
They said the end is comin (They said the end is comin)
Everyones up to somethin (Everyones up to somethin)
I find myself runnin home to your sweet nothings
Outside, theyre push and shovin (Outside, theyre push and shovin)
Youre in the kitchen hummin (Youre in the kitchen hummin)

We could leave the Christmas lights up til January
And this is our place, we make the rules
And theres a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home
Youre my, my, my, my lover
We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And Im highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
Ive loved you three summers now, honey, but I want em all
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
Youre my, my, my, my lover

Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My hearts been borrowed and yours has been blue
Alls well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And youll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, Ill save you a seat, lover
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
Youre my, my, my, my
Oh, youre my, my, my, my
Darling, youre my, my, my, my lover1Embed
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You got that long hair slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
Midnight, you come and pick me up, no headlights
Long drive, could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh
Its been a while since I have even heard from you (Heard from you)
And I should just tell you to leave cause I
Know exactly where it leads but I
Watch it go round and round each time
Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You got that long hair slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style

Dallas, will you, please, make some noise for my incredible band?
We were both young when I first saw you
Close my eyes and the flashback starts
Im standing there on a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, Hello, little did I know?
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, Stay away from Juliet
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, please, dont go
And I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
Ill be waiting, all thats left to do is run
Youll be the prince and Ill be the princess
Its a love story, baby, just say, Yes
Oh, oh
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town, I said
Romeo save me, Ive been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I dont know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said
Marry me, Juliet, youll never have to be alone
I love you and thats all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
Its a love story, baby, just say, Yes
Oh, I remember you drivin to my house in the middle of the night
Im the one who makes you laugh
When you know youre about to cry
I know your favorite songs
And you tell me about your dreams
I think I know where you belong
Think I know its with me
Cant you see that Im the one who understands you?
Been here all along so why cant you see?
You belong with me, yeah
Let me see you jump!
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time, how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me
You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me?
You belong with me1Embed
You look at me
I fake a smile so you wont see
That I want and Im needing
Everything that we should be
Ill bet shes beautiful, that girl ya talk about
And shes got everything that I have to live without
You talk to me
I laugh cause its so damn funny
But I cant even see
Anyone when youre with me
You say youre so in love, you finally got it right
I wonder if you know youre all I think about at night
Youre the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
Youre the song in the car
I keep singing, dont know why I do...

You walk by me
Cant you tell that I cant breathe?
And there you go, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be
Shed better hold ya tight, give you all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know shes lucky cause
Youre the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
Youre the song in the car
I keep singing, dont know why I do...
Youre the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who’s got enough of me to break my heart
Youre the song in the car
I keep singing, dont know why I do...
Youre the time taken up, but theres never enough
And youre all that I need to fall into
You look at me
I fake a smile so you wont seeEmbed
I need you more than I know how to mention
And Id give forever to get your attention
Be youre summer midnight with starry blue eyes
That only see you and are yours every night
Ooh, ooh, loves like this
Its something I missed
Ooh, ooh, loves like this
And that small town daydream
Lasted all night
Cause tonight all those bright city lights
Just look at you look at me
Heaven looked down to see
Were falling now
And theres nothing we aint too sure of
Just two kids making up for lost love
All of the days that I couldnt get it right
It all disappeared lying here by your side
With your dirty blue jeans and my crooked smile
You make it look easy changing my life

Ooh, ooh, loves like this
Its something I missed
Ooh, ooh, loves like this
And that small town daydream
Lasted all night
Cause tonight all those bright city lights
Just look at you look at me
Heaven looked down to see
Were falling now
And theres nothing we aint too sure of
Just two kids making up for lost love
Heaven had quite the time
To figure this life out
But baby Ive got mine
To give you everything you dream about
Ooh, ooh, loves like this
Its something I missed
Ooh, ooh, loves like this
And that small town daydream
Lasted all night
Cause tonight all those bright city lights
Just look at you look at me
Heaven looked down to see

Here you are now
Fresh from your war
Back from the edge of time
And all that you were
Stripped to the bone
I thought youd want to know
That when you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless
Ill never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong
Into my arms
Breathless
Breathless
Lay down your guns
Too weak to run
Nothing can harm you here
Your precious heart
Broken and scarred
Somehow you made it through
I only ask that you wont go again

When you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless
Ill never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong
Into my arms
Breathless
Im so glad to see you smiling
So good to hear your laugh
I think that youve found you even
Missed yourself
Im only asking this because I think that
Truth be told
Oh, youll never go again
Again, again
When you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless
Ill never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong
Into my arms
Breathless
Breathless
When you feel the world is crashing
Come running into my arms2Embed
The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There aren’t nothing about you that dont do something for me
Once I thought that love was something I could never do
Never knew that I could feel this much
But this yearning in the deep part of my heart for you
Is more than a reaction to your touch
Its a perfect passion and I cant get enough
The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There aren’t nothing about you that dont do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
Theres aren’t nothing about you (there aren’t nothing about you)
That dont do something for me
Whoa
In my life Ive been hammered by some heavy blows
That never knocked me off my feet
All you got to do is smile at me and down I go
And baby its no mystery why I surrender
Girl you got everything

The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There aren’t nothing about you that dont do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
Theres aren’t nothing about you (there aren’t nothing about you)
That dont do something for me
I love your attitude, your rose tattoo, your every thought
Your smile, you lips and girl the list goes on and on and on
The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There aren’t nothing about you that dont do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
Theres aren’t nothing about you (there aren’t nothing about you)
That dont do something for me
The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
Your dance, your drive, you make me feel alive
The way you talk, the way you tease
By now I think you see that
There aren’t nothing about you that dont do something for meEmbed
Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if hes a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holdin him for ransom, some
Some boys are tryin too hard, he dont try at all though
Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta
I, I, I see how this is gon go
Touch me and youll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know
In the middle of the night, in my dreams (Yeah)
You should see the things we do, baby
In the middle of the night, in my dreams (The night, my dreams)
I know Im gonna be with you, so Ill take my time
Are you ready for it?
Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin sorry
But if Im a thief, then he can join the heist, and
Well move to an island, and
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor
Every love Ive known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now, Im so very tame now
Never be the same now, now

I, I, I see how this is gon go
Touch me and youll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know
In the middle of the night, in my dreams (Night, in my dreams)
You should see the things we do, baby (Wed do, baby)
Yeah, in the middle of the night in my dreams (My dreams)
I know Im gonna be with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it?
Night, in my dreams
Wed do, baby
Yeah, in the middle of the night
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby1Embed
Something about me didnt fit into your perfect world
I bet the bluegrass stained your smile
You should use a darker color when you write on the wall
I havent read it a thousand times
Maybe if you saw me for a second you would realize
Honey I was trying so hard
To talk, walk, think, stop
Anytime you want me to
Bend all my rules
I used to let you choose
Who you wanted me to be
This time Im flying free
Its my turn to be me
You liked the face but you had to replace me
Inside I saw the walls of me go down
You can take the girl away from
Cowboy hats and steel guitars
Shell still sing the same old songs

Maybe if you saw me for a second you would realize
Honey I was trying so hard
To talk, walk, think, stop
Anytime you want me to
Bend all my rules
I used to let you choose
Who you wanted me to be
This time Im flying free
Its my turn to be me
Turned on that radio
Hey thats when I realized
It wasnt our song, it was yours
And in conversation baby I was decoration
Now I deserve a little bit more than
To talk, walk, think, stop
Anytime you want me to
Bend all my rules
I used to let you choose
Who you wanted me to be
This time Im flying free
Its my turn to be meEmbed
Well, she was an American girl
Raised on promises
She couldnt help thinking that there was a little more to life
Somewhere else
After all it was a great big world
With lots of places to run to
And if she had to die trying
She had one little promise she was going to keep
Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Make it last all night
She was an American girl
Well, it was kind of cold that night
She stood alone on her balcony
She could see the cars roll by
Out on 441
Like waves crashing on the beach
And for one desperate moment there
He crept back in her memory
God, its so painful
Its something thats so close but still so far out of reach

Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Make it last all night
She was an American girl
Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Make it last all night
Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Oh, take it easy now
Oh yeah, all right
She was an American girlEmbed
Before I tell you my thoughts on the matter, you should know that youre reading the opinion of an enthusiastic optimist: one of the few living souls in the music industry who still believes that the music industry is not dying…its just coming alive
There are many (many) people who predict the downfall of music sales and the irrelevancy of the album as an economic entity. I am not one of them. In my opinion, the value of an album is, and will continue to be, based on the amount of heart and soul an artist has bled into a body of work, and the financial value that artists (and their labels) place on their music when it goes out into the marketplace. Piracy, file sharing and streaming have shrunk the numbers of paid album sales drastically, and every artist has handled this blow differently
In recent years, youve probably read the articles about major recording artists who have decided to practically give their music away, for this promotion or that exclusive deal. My hope for the future, not just in the music industry, but in every young girl I meet…is that they all realize their worth and ask for it
Music is art, and art is important and rare. Important, rare things are valuable. Valuable things should be paid for. Its my opinion that music should not be free, and my prediction is that individual artists and their labels will someday decide what an albums price point is. I hope they dont underestimate themselves or undervalue their art
Arrows Through the Heart
In mentioning album sales, Id like to point out that people are still buying albums, but now theyre buying just a few of them. They are buying only the ones that hit them like an arrow through the heart or have made them feel strong or allowed them to feel like they really arent alone in feeling so alone. It isnt as easy today as it was 20 years ago to have a multiplatinum-selling album, and as artists, that should challenge and motivate us
There are always going to be those artists who break through on an emotional level and end up in peoples lives forever. The way I see it, fans view music the way they view their relationships. Some music is just for fun, a passing fling (the ones they dance to at clubs and parties for a month while the song is a huge radio hit, that they will soon forget they ever danced to). Some songs and albums represent seasons of our lives, like relationships that we hold dear in our memories but had their time and place in the past
However, some artists will be like finding the one. We will cherish every album they put out until they retire and we will play their music for our children and grandchildren. As an artist, this is the dream bond we hope to establish with our fans. I think the future still holds the possibility for this kind of bond, the one my father has with the Beach Boys and the one my mother has with Carly Simon
I think forming a bond with fans in the future will come in the form of constantly providing them with the element of surprise. No, I did not say shock; I said surprise. I believe couples can stay in love for decades if they just continue to surprise each other, so why cant this love affair exist between an artist and their fans?
In the YouTube generation we live in, I walked out onstage every night of my stadium tour last year knowing almost every fan had already seen the show online. To continue to show them something they had never seen before, I brought out dozens of special guest performers to sing their hits with me. My generation was raised being able to flip channels if we got bored, and we read the last page of the book when we got impatient. We want to be caught off guard, delighted, left in awe. I hope the next generations artists will continue to think of inventive ways of keeping their audiences on their toes, as challenging as that might be
There are a few things I have witnessed becoming obsolete in the past few years, the first being autographs. I havent been asked for an autograph since the invention of the iPhone with a front-facing camera. The only memento kids these days want is a selfie. Its part of the new currency, which seems to be how many followers you have on Instagram.
Fan Power
A friend of mine, who is an actress, told me that when the casting for her recent movie came down to two actresses, the casting director chose the actress with more Twitter followers. I see this becoming a trend in the music industry. For me, this dates back to 2005 when I walked into my first record-label meetings, explaining to them that I had been communicating directly with my fans on this new site called Myspace. In the future, artists will get record deals because they have fans—not the other way around
Another theme I see fading into the gray is genre distinction. These days, nothing great you hear on the radio seems to come from just one musical influence. The wild, unpredictable fun in making music today is that anything goes. Pop sounds like hip hop; country sounds like rock; rock sounds like soul; and folk sounds like country—and to me, thats incredible progress. I want to make music that reflects all of my influences, and I think that in the coming decades the idea of genres will become less of a career-defining path and more of an organizational tool
This moment in music is so exciting because the creative avenues an artist can explore are limitless. In this moment in music, stepping out of your comfort zone is rewarded, and sonic evolution is not only accepted…it is celebrated. The only real risk is being too afraid to take a risk at all
Celebrity Spotlight
I predict that some things will never change. There will always be an increasing fixation on the private lives of musicians, especially the younger ones. Artists who were at their commercial peak in the 70s, 80s and 90s tell me, It was never this crazy for us back then! And I suspect Ill be saying that same thing to younger artists someday (God help them). There continues to be a bad girl vs. good girl/clean-cut vs. sexy debate, and for as long as those labels exist, I just hope there will be contenders on both sides. Everyone needs someone to relate to
And as for me? Ill just be sitting back and growing old, watching all of this happen or not happen, all the while trying to maintain a life rooted in this same optimism
And Id also like a nice garden5Embed
What a thing to see
What a thing to be
What a perfect love, what a perfect home
Cause every time she walks
And every time she talks
Is every time he knows what a perfect world hes living on
But whenever hes gone and when shes all alone
His heart goes out to her on the telephone
And he says, Sugar, how I love you
How I think about you all the time
He calls her Sugar cause shes the sweetest thing
Oh, shes the best thing hell ever find
With her midnight hair
And with his favorite stare
Shes a southern belle, hes a rockout king
When she looks around
Oh, she knows shes found
Such a perfect life, such a perfect thing

And whenever hes gone and when shes all alone
His heart goes out to her on the telephone
And he says, Sugar, how I love you
How I think about you all the time
He calls her Sugar cause shes the sweetest thing
Oh, shes the best thing hell ever find
Oh, theres a reason for every season
Theres a change within the range of every heart
But the reason and the season
Seem to be right so far
And he says, Sugar, how I love you
How I think about you all the time
He calls her Sugar cause shes the sweetest thing
Oh, shes the best thing hell ever find
He calls her Sugar1Embed

You dont have to do to win big
You just have to think it
Some folks say the glass is half full
Others choose to drink it
Some say the grass could be greener
And the other side aint far away
But I say the old could be newer
And love still counts when it doesnt stay
Some say I love you
Some say love needs proof
Its all in your point of view
He hated pink so she threw out her favorite clothes
His NFL was turned to TLC
Babys got an attitude and thinks they just dont know
But they all do and wish that she could see

Depends on ones opinion
Worst of all they never call

Im like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never wouldve known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
Im begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, thats my man
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind (wind)
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize Id cheat to win
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
Im begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, thats my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
Im begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, thats my man

Life was a willow, and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow, and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a 90s trend
Wait for the signal, and Ill meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open-shut case

I can see you standing, honey
With his arms around your body
Laughin, but the jokes not funny at all
And it took you five whole minutes
To pack us up and leave me with it
Holdin all this love out here in the hall
I think Ive seen this film before
And I didnt like the ending
Youre not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town, now Im in exile, seein you out
I think Ive seen this film before
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
I can see you starin, honey
Like hes just your understudy
Like youd get your knuckles bloody for me
Second, third, and hundredth chances
Balancin on brеaking branches
Those eyеs add insult to injury

I think Ive seen this film before
And I didnt like the ending
Im not your problem anymore
So who am I offending now?
You were my crown, now Im in exile, seein you out
I think Ive seen this film before
So Im leaving out the side door
So step right out, there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you
All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didnt even hear me out
You never gave no warning sign
All this time
I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)
I couldnt turn things around (You never turned things around)
Cause you never gave no warning sign (I gave so many signs)
So many signs, so many signs

I love you when youre singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because

This guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City
This cowboys running from himself
And shes been living on the highest shelf

Writing the song Lover was one of those magical experiences that you sometimes get to have as a songwriter. Um, I wrote it really quick in the middle of the night. As soon as I wrote it, I knew I wanted it to be the album title. And I knew that writing it kinda would depict the tone of the entire record
So it was a real catalyst for what this album turned into
And I wrote it alone, so I wanted to go in and play it for Jack Antonoff who I knew who would be the perfect person to produce it. And so I walked into the studio and I sat in the piano
And this is what happened
So it is, its basically, I dont see it as a piano. I think its that like, kinda of, dreamy, guitary, throwback, but not like camp throwback, so
We could leave the Christmas lights up til January
This is our place, we make the rules
And theres a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out, take me home
Youre my, my, my, my lover
Yeah, I love the walk down
I love the walk down
I was trying to figure out what the hell is gonna happen there
So the, so

My, my, my, my lover
We could let our friends crash on the couches
This is our place, we make the call
And Im highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
Ive loved you three summers now, honey, but I want em all
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out, and take me home
Youre my, my, my, my lover
Okay and then I have this bridge thing thats um, essentially
Well, no I was
I did, I did it in this key
But it could be like a thing wheres like a key change
So it plays off of the walk down-ish
But its, this is the melody of it, it goes, its like
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hands
I take this magnetic force-
Oh, fuck
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My hearts been borrowed and yours has been blue
Alls well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And youll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
Wait so goes like
And youll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, Ill save you a seat
So goes, and you, it goes
And youll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
My hearts been borrowed your hearts been blue
Alls well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And youll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, Ill save you a seat
You like? Yeah! Ive never, I never do these cords, but, I was really at the piano, like, hashing it out yesterday1Embed
I think of you every single evening
As I lay awake at night
I try to think; try to walk away with you...me in
And I say
Honey baby dont do nothing crazy
When I say that everything will be fine!
Oh, honey baby, oh
How can you blame me
When I say I wanna make you mine?
Cause everybody else in the world is driving me crazy
Except you, honey baby!
Oh!
Flying high, I can see his smiling
As we walk down by the drives
Take my hand, take my breath away
Cause you make me feel like flying!
Honey baby dont do nothing crazy
When I say that everything will be fine!
Oh, honey baby, oh
How can you blame me
When I say I wanna make you mine?
Cause everybody else in the world is driving me crazy
Except you, honey baby!

Oh, you are everything Ill never need
Oh, you are everything I wanna be!
Drive me crazy, have me baby
All I really wanna say is
Honey baby dont do nothing crazy
When I say that everything will be fine!
Oh, honey baby, oh
How can you blame me
When I say I wanna make you mine?
Cause everybody else in the world is driving me crazy
Except you, honey baby!Embed
Throwing pennies at the fountain
When youre standing on a mountain
Its kind of hard to aim
Like the tree we carved our names in
There must be an explanation
Guess it didnt get enough rain
I need reasons why youre leaving
Well I guess I wished on a plane
I thought it was a star
I guess what you wrote on paper
Wasnt written on your heart
Couldve sworn you said you loved me
I guess I heard you wrong
And I guess I wished on a plane
That I thought was a star
Diving off into the deep end
Honestly believed youd be there
When I jumped in
Guess it aint your territory
We had the perfect love story
Except the ending
Nothing comes true
When it comes to you, oh

Well I guess I wished on a plane
I thought it was a star
I guess what you wrote on paper
Wasnt written in your heart
Couldve sworn you said you loved me
I guess I heard you wrong
And I guess I wished on a plane
That I thought was a star
The night was so cloudy
Its not my fault
I just couldnt see
And I guess I wished on a plane
I thought it was a star
Guess what you wrote on paper
Wasnt written in your heart
Couldve sworn you said you loved me
I guess I heard you wrong
And I guess I wished on a plane

Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Cause I knew you
Steppin on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy, I
I knew you
Leavin like a father
Running like water, I
Cause when you are young, they assume you know nothing
But I knew youd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew youd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew Id curse you for the longest time
Chasin shadows in the grocery line
I knew youd miss me once the thrill expired
And youd be standin in my front porch light
And I knew youd come back to me
Youd come back to me
And youd come back to me
And youd come back

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someones bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite
And youd come back to me
Salt air, and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers of Are you sure?
Never have I ever before
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
Cause you were never mine
Back when we were still changing for the better
Wanting was enough
For me, it was enough
To live for the hope of it all
Cancel plans just in case youd call
And say, Meet me behind the mall
So much for summer love and saying us
Cause you werent mine to lose
You werent mine to lose

Come on, gather round, Im gonna tell you how the fire went out
Sorry for the inconvenience, I didnt mean to let you down
We were supposed to be forever but its too bad you didnt see that to me
You were the perfect view of misery
I never talked about the tears I cried
All the sleepless nights or the endless fights
I never talked about the days he called
There was something wrong, it was all my fault
I had it all, what a shame, what a fall now
But in case you havent heard the news
There wasnt much love to lose
Lets talk about that golden boy that I met on a winter night
How was I supposed to know that he was just as cold inside?
He smiled and I smiled, well the cameras in your mind
And I lied, I swore that everything was fine
I never talked about the tears I cried
All the sleepless nights or the endless fights
I never talked about the nights he called
There was something wrong, it was all my fault
I had it all, what a shame, what a fall now
But in case you havent heard the news
There wasnt much love to lose

I know you wanna talk about me
How I gave up on love so foolishly
But keep in mind
I never talked about the tears I cried
All the sleepless nights or the endless fights
I never talked about the nights he called
There was something wrong, it was all my fault
I had it all, what a shame, what a fall now

Oh
We were standing in an empty room
The moonlight was falling
You were holding my hand when the car pulled up for you
And I could have spent a life with you
But those days are over
You were calling my name
When your face faded from view
Wasnt it you that told me?
The sun would always chase the day
Wasnt it you that told me?
Angels fly, in the air tonight
Saying wasnt it just like swimming out on the lake?
Stars collide in the air so light
Or was it just like those promises that you made? On our last night
Oh
I remember waking up with you
The days doing nothing
You meant more to me then, than you ever knew
You were going to be a doctor, a movie star, poet at a Nobel seminar
Hope the the world never tore that out of you


Tell me whatever happened to the things you loved?
And the songs we played and the Indian days
Whatever happened to the things you gave away?
Like Harold and martin singing
I was waving as you drove away
The sunlight was falling
You were riding backwards in a dusty window pane
Angels fly in the air tonight
Was it just like the promises that we made?
And stars collide in the air so light
Was it just like those promises that you made?
On our last night
On our last night

It wouldve been nice to see you coming
But that wouldve ruined the surprise
It wouldve been nice to have a picture perfect world
But then the truth would hurt my eyes
It wouldve been good for you to be there
And every time you always would
Everything seems to have a picture perfect time
And nothing seems to be a blur
Its hard to see a picture drop before it hits the ground
Its nice to know youre here and youre helping me down
But you were always there when I needed
You would always see me clearly
And you were never looking for a thank you
Im saying one for you
Wouldve been cool to never fall down
But then I never wouldve seen
The power isnt with the picture perfect person
You told me better things to come from in between
Its hard to see a picture drop before it hits the ground
Its nice to know youre here and youre helping me down
But you were always there when I needed
You would always see me clearly
And you were never looking for a thank you

Jump into the pool from the balcony
Everyone swimming in a champagne sea
And there are no rules when you show up here
Bass beat rattling the chandelier
Feeling so Gatsby for that whole year
So whyd you have to rain on my parade?
Im shaking my head and locking the gates
This is why we cant have nice things, darling
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we cant have nice things, honey
Did you think I wouldnt hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we cant have nice things
It was so nice being friends again
There I was, giving you a second chance
But then you stabbed in the back while shaking my hand
And therein lies the issue
Friends dont try to trick you
Get you on the phone and mind-twist you
And so I took an axe to a mended fence
But Im not the only friend youve lost lately
If only you werent so shady
Heres a toast to my real friends
They dont care about the he-said-she-said
And heres to my baby
He aint reading what they call me lately
And heres to my momma
Had to listen to all this drama
And heres to you
Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do
Haha, I cant even say it with a straight face
This is why we cant have nice things, darling (Darling)
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we cant have nice things, honey
Did you think I wouldnt hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we cant have nice things, darling (And heres to my real friends)
Because you break them
I had to take them away (And heres to my baby)
This is why we cant have nice things, darling (He didnt care about that he-said-she-said)
Did you think I wouldnt hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we cant have nice thingsEmbed
I like my music loud
I like my windows down
So I can scream
I like my trucks a little
Bigger than the rest
So I can see
Dont try me
Dont fight me
You be you and Ill be me
They say Ive always known
What I wanted
My friends and enemies
Will tell you its true
You will find out
I always get it
I know what I want
And it aint you
Your mom and daddys walls
Are covered up in pictures of you
You never met a mirror
That you didnt look again into
So sorry, dont worry
Im sure there are so many girls
Who love you like you do

They say Ive always known
What I wanted
My friends and enemies
Will tell you its true
You will find out
I always get it
I know what I want
And it aint you
It aint you, oh
Oh baby, dont persuade me
I know that you aint used to no
So let me say it real slow
They say Ive always known
What I wanted, its true
My friends and enemies
Will tell you its true
You will find out
I always get it
I know what I want
And they say Ive always known
What I wanted
My friends and enemies
Will tell you its true
And youll find out
I always get it
I know what I want
And it aint youEmbed
We gather here, we line up, weepin in a sunlit room
And if Im on fire, youll be made of ashes, too
Even on my worst day, did I deserve, babe
All the hell you gave me?
Cause I loved you, I swear I loved you
Til my dying day
I didnt have it in myself to go with grace
And youre the hero flying around, saving face
And if Im dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishin I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet
We gather stones, nevеr knowing what theyll mean
Some to throw, somе to make a diamond ring
You know I didnt want to have to haunt you
But what a ghostly scene
You wear the same jewels that I gave you
As you bury me
I didnt have it in myself to go with grace
Cause when Id fight, you used to tell me I was brave
And if Im dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishin I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet

And I can go anywhere I want
Anywhere I want, just not home
And you can aim for my heart, go for blood
But you would still miss me in your bones
And I still talk to you
When Im screaming at the sky
And when you cant sleep at night
You hear my stolen lullabies
I didnt have it in myself to go with grace
And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves
You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same
Cursing my name, wishin I stayed
You turned into your worst fears
And youre tossing out blame, drunk on this pain
Crossin out the good years
And youre cursing my name, wishin I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet
Yeah, look at how my tears ricochet
Look at all of my tears
Turnin into your tears
Look at how my tears ricochet2Embed
... I used to fly
Didnt matter where Id been
Cause Id seen the sky
I wanna tell you why
But somehow I know I
Would break down and cry
I know you cant see me here
But I am not alone
Im lying here in invisible arms
And I wont be alone tonight
You... you know I would die
Before I let them see me
See me cry
Please dont leave tonight
Oh let me down slowly
Show me a light
I know you cant see me here
But I am not alone
Im lying here in invisible arms
And I wont be alone tonight

Oh let me think Im strong
Please dont bring me down
I need you tonight
I know you cant see me here
But I am not alone
Im lying here in invisible arms
And I wont be alone tonight
I... I used to fly
Didnt matter where Id been

Hey a little bit ago we were talking about uh, songwriting and listening to songs and putting down what you feel in the song, and um, up next in the countdown is Taylor Swift, and have you heard this song yet?
I have heard this song
Tim McGraw. And what what did you think the first time you heard it? Or how was the first time?
It was awesome. Uh, except for, I didnt know if I should, I should take it as a compliment or I should feel old?
Ah, ha ha ha
I didnt know which one but the more, the more I hear it the more, I dont know if its true or not, but I start taking it as a compliment and not that I feel that Im old, I dont know if thats true, but thats what I choose to think.
Why dont we find out. Taylor is a compliment, or uh, hes old?
Oh its definitely a compliment. Yeah. (Laughing)
Tim McGraw, meet Taylor Swift.
Nice-
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you, Taylor. How you doing?
Im doing great. How are you doing?
Im doing good. Congratulations on your record. Its doing great.
Thank you so much. Im just so excited. Thank you for, uh, having good... music and everything. I swear Im not a stalker (Laughing)
Well-
The funny thing about this song is ya know, as a writer, some of the songs that you write like four hours, youll do them writing a song and itll be good and everything but I wrote this one in literally 15 minutes. And ya know, I really didnt think anything about calling in Tim McGraw so I kinda shelved it for like three months and never even thought that it was going to be a single. But, um, my label heard it and was like, were putting that out.(Laughing)
Well, Im glad ya did, cause, um, its doing well for ya.
So I-, so I understand that you two guys have not talked.
No.
You havent met.
No.
No, weve never talked or met or anything.
I sent her a message one time. I think with Entertainment Weekly
Or something like that. Oh, I dont remember what show it was. I was doing an interview and they were going to interview Taylor the next day. So, I sent her a little message, so, I dont know if she got it or not.
Oh my God. They never gave that to me.
They didnt? Okay, well, there ya go. I did. (Laughing)
So I-I.
Weve just officially never never talked or messaged or anything.
Not at all.
So I thought, I think its pretty brave to put out a song called Tim McGraw without maybe talking to Tim McGraw. Did you mind?
It was definitely kind of a chance. Ya know, I didnt say anything bad in the song so I was kinda thinking, ya know, he wouldnt take it too bad.
Well, thank you for that. Thank you for not saying anything bad
Im sure theres plenty that couldve been said. Tell me-
Could you tell Faith that I said hello?
I sure will. I sure will. And she loves the song too by the way.
Oh my gosh, shes awesome.
I agree.
This, this...Tell me about writing a song. Um, did this, did this really happen?
Well, yeah. I mean, I never really kinda went into this writing
Session on Im gonna write a song called Tim McGraw
Um, yeah. because, that would just be weird. But um... (Laughing).
I actually this this is kinda strange, but I actually came up with the
melody and ideas for this song in math class in my freshman year
of high school.
Now I feel old.
And um, I was sitting there and was kind of started singing it to myself. And I was going through a period where I was dating this guy that was going off to college and I knew we were gonna break up. So I started to think about all the things that I knew would remind him of me. And its kinda like a given one of all my friends ya know? That my favorite songs are Tim McGraw songs. They just are.
Aww, thank you.
And uh, you know so I kinda just thought about that first. And so it pointed to the song and just sat down at that piano. And wrote it with this co-writer who was kinda wondering if I was crazy or not but it turned out alright. And ya know, the funny thing is that I shelved this song for like three months and never never even played it for anybody, never even demoed it. And uh, then one time I was just goofing around and played it for my record label president and he goes, Well, thats your first single. (Laughing)
And Im like, well.
Well, you can write songs about me anytime, Taylor (Laughing)
Thats awesome. Theres a part two coming out next month.
Alright, great (Laughing)
Well, congratulations cause its your first single. First top ten hit and thats pretty exciting. And I know youre off to the races here.
Youre just doing great and, uh, congratulations, very exciting for you!
Awesome, its been so exciting, Tim, when are you gonna start like bringing out opening acts again?
Um, I dont know. I dont know. Well have to look into that. (Laughing)
Well, Ill, I have someone who I think will be really perfect for it.
Ya do? What would-
Yeah.
What would their name be?
Uh, um, I think Taylor something.
Something like that, yeah
But.
Well, Ill, Ill be more than happy to have you out with me.
Just consider it.
Ah, well thats very good! Youre pretty fearless, Taylor Swift. Ill tell ya that.
Right shes, shes gonna be forward this time.
I think so. Country Countdown USA is now a booking agency as well.
Absolutely.
Hey Taylor, I know youre on the road, thank ya so much for joining us.
It was awesome and thank you. It was good to meet you, Tim.
You too. Good talking to you. Bye bye now.
Bye.
Good luck out there.
Thanks!Embed
Watch me go into the world today
Watch me try to blow the past away
Watch me laugh and watch me cry
Watch me fall and watch me fly
‘Cause I’m living in a brand new world
And you think I’m just another girl
But I’m living just a day at a time
And keeping it mine
Someday I’m gonna fly
Watch me catch a star and pin it down
Watch me live another time around
Watch me doubt the things I love
Watch me find what I’m proud of
‘Cause I’m living in a brand new world
And you think I’m just another girl
But I’m living just a day at a time
And keeping it mine
Someday I’m gonna fly
And I may break my wings
And fall flat on my shattered heart
And I may hit the ground
But I will never fall apart
‘Cause I’m living in a brand new world
And you think I’m just another girl
But I’m living just a day at a time
And keeping it mine
I’m living in a brand new world
And you think I’m just another girl
But I’m living just a day at a time
And keeping it mine
Someday I’m gonna fly1Embed
I’ve been counting days and
I’ve been being patient
About a little thing called love
Crossing all my fingers
Letting my heart linger
Trying to get some help from up above
I don’t want to jinx my luck
I’ve left it all behind me
And I’ve been hoping every day
That someday you will find me
So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
I’ll pray for you and me and hope I’m right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight
Dreaming of you baby
I’ve been thinking maybe
There is something I can do
‘Cause I’ve been on the verge of
Running around in circles
Baby all I want is you

I don’t want to jinx my luck
I’ve left it all behind me
And I’ve been hoping every day
That someday you will find me
So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
I’ll pray for you and me and hope I’m right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight
Do you believe in miracles
Please tell me if you’ve seen one
I’d like to know just where to go
Because I think I need one
So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
I’ll pray for you and me and hope I’m right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight
So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
I’ll pray for you and me and hope I’m right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonightEmbed
Isnt it funny how many times we can say
Weve drawn the line, crossed it out, turned the page
And moved on
Thats what we thought
But here I am in the same old car
Having myself another same old brown-eyed thought
Uh oh, uh oh
I wont tell nobody
I wont tell my friends
Well just drive down this road til the one were on ends
And well tell each other things like I need you
You and me
Baby this is what we do
I finally see
There are people you just come back to
So fall back on me
Ill fall back on you
We always let someone come in between
Talk around the truth and never say what we mean
Look at all this wasted time

You wont tell nobody
I wont tell my friends
Well just drive down this road and pray it doesnt end
And well tell each other things like I love you
You and me
Baby this is what we do
I finally see
There are people that you come back to
So fall back on me
Ill fall back on you
Maybe well last
Maybe we wont
Maybe well stop talking and Ill haunt you like a ghost
But just maybe, you belong with me
You and me
Baby this is what we do
I finally see
There are people that you come back to
So fall back on me
Baby, Ill fall back on you
Fall back on me
Baby, baby, Ill fall back on you
Fall back on you, ooh, ooh
Fall back on youEmbed
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
But I never thought Id live to see it break
Its getting dark and its all too quiet
And I cant trust anything now
Its coming over you like its all a big mistake
Oh-Whoa, holding my breath
Wont lose you again
Somethings made your eyes go cold
Come on, come on, dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Somethings gone terribly wrong
Youre all I wanted
Come on, come on, dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Cant breathe whenever youre gone
Cant turn back now, Im haunted
Stood there and watched you walk away
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time, Im wishing it was you instead

Oh-whoa, holding my breath
Whoa Wont see you again
Something keeps me holding onto nothing
Come on, come on, dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Somethings gone terribly wrong
You are all I wanted
Come on, come on, dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Cant breathe whenever youre gone
Cant turn back now, Im haunted
I know
I know
I just know
Youre not gone, you cant be gone, no
Come on, come on, dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Somethings gone terribly wrong
Wont finish what you started
Come on, come on, dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Cant breathe whenever youre gone
I Cant go back, Im haunted
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh- woah oh, oh)
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Never ever thought Id see it break
Never thought Id see itEmbed
On a crowded highway
Through a night alone
I was barely breathing
I was crawling home
Well, its quite not London
Or the south of France
Or an Asian Island
Or a second chance
Going back to Nashville
Thinking bout the whole thing
Guess you gotta run sometimes
Maybe Im a fast train
Blowin through a valley
Watching all my life go by
Youre a distant memory
Youre an exit sign
I was talking crazy
On the drivers side
And I know I hurt you
But I cant confess
Was that blood or a wine stain
On your wedding dress

Going back to Nashville
Thinking bout the whole thing
Guess you gotta run sometimes
Maybe Im a fast train
Blowin through a valley
Watching all my life go by
Going back to Nashville
Laughing at a bad break
Whats the use of wondering why?
Maybe Im a storm front
Blowing through a valley
Tearing up a good July
And its safe and warm
Where nothing ever happens
Could it be so hard
To realign a star or two
Change a southern night for you
Going back to Nashville
Thinking bout the whole thing
Guess you gotta run sometimes
Maybe Im a fast train
Blowin through a valley
Watching all my life go by
Going back to Nashville
Laughing at a bad break
Whats the use of wondering why?
Maybe Im a storm front
Blowing through a valley
Tearing up a good July
Going back to Nashville
Im going back to Nashville
Going back to Naaaaahh....
Going back to Nashville
Whats the use of wondering why?Embed
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in
On a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family
All dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry
This is surely not
What you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say
Dont say yes, run away now
Ill meet you when youre out
Of the church at the back door
Dont wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said speak now

Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play
A song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited
By your lovely bride-to-be
She floats down the aisle
Like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me
You wish it was me (Dont you?)
Dont say yes, run away now
Ill meet you when youre out
Of the church at the back door
Dont wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said speak now
Dont say yes, run away now
Ill meet you when youre out
Of the church at the back door
Dont wait or say a single vow
Your time is running out
And they said speak now
Ooh, la-da-da-da, oh
Ooh, ooh
(Say a single vow)
I hear the preacher say
Speak now or forever hold your peace
Theres the silence, theres my last chance
I stand up with shaking hands, all eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But Im only looking at you
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in
On a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
Dont say yes, run away now
Ill meet you when youre out
Of the church at the back door
Dont wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said speak now
And you’ll say
Lets run away now
Ill meet you when
Im out of my tux at the back door
Baby, I didnt say my vows
So glad you were around when they said
Speak nowEmbed

Theres somethin bout the way
The street looks when its just rained
Theres a glow off the pavement
Walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot
Yeah
Hey, hey, hey
Were drivin down the road
I wonder if you know
Im tryin so hard not to get caught up now
But youre just so cool
Run your hands through your hair
Absentmindedly makin me want you
And I dont know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst
Fearless
And I dont know why when with you Id dance
In a storm in my best dress
Fearless

Hey, hey, hey
So baby drive slow
Til we run out of road in this one horse town
I wanna stay right here in this passenger seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now, capture it, remember it
Cause I dont know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst
Fearless
And I dont know why but with you Id dance
In a storm in my best dress
Fearless
But I wont hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, Im yours
Hey, hey, hey
Cause I dont know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst
Fearless
And I dont know why but with you Id dance
In a storm in my best dress
FearlessEmbed
Like one of those fireflies
Oh, it looks so good till its in your hand
Its like one of those memories
Where you cant let go but you just cant stand
Its like one of those crazy dreams
And the permanent screens in the magazines
Saying, Whyd I love?
All it does is break your heart
One morning does it all add up?
Or am I just standing on the edge of crazy?
Youre getting close to giving up
In a big old way, knocks you down to the other side every time
Love or lie, live or die
I, well, I guess thats life
Like one of those people
With the beautiful eyes and the perfect face
Its like one of those stories
Where the hero dies in the very last race
Like one of those endless cries
And the crazy lies of a hurting child
Saying, Why did love have to hurt?
It broke my heart

One morning does it all add up?
Or am I just standing on the edge of crazy?
Youre getting close to giving up
In a big old way, knocks you down to the other side every time
Love or lie, live or die
I, well, I guess thats life
I always liked to think
That I was always brave enough
To try to master any push and shove
Well I guess I never qualified love
One morning does it all add up?
Or am I just standing on the edge of crazy?
Youre getting close to giving up
In a big old way, knocks you down to the other side every time
Love or lie, live or die
I, well, I guess thats life
Oh, I guess thats life
Well, I guess thats lifeEmbed
I don’t need a lot
But theres one thing
Love has taught me
It’s to never expect too much
Don’t need a believable touch
I just need you
I just need you
And I might, I found life
Why should we be wasting time?
You don’t know what you missed
When I look into your eyes like this
And you should be in front of me
Seeing everything to see
Looking at you
Check out this view
Think of a quiet beach
Think of how the waves crash down
Think about a summer’s eve
No offense to them but they aint got nothing on you
Walking with you
In the light or in the dark
Well nothing shadows who you are

And you don’t know what you missed
When I look into your eyes like this
And you should be in front of me
Seeing everything to see
Looking at you
Check out this view
I look outside the window
Everyday see something new
But all I ever wanted was a
Window looking at you, at you
And you don’t know what you missed
When I look into your eyes like this
And you should be in front of me
Seeing everything to see
You don’t know what you missed
When I look into your eyes like this
And you should be in front of me
Seeing everything to see
Looking at you
Check out this viewEmbed
Are you trying to make me fall?
Cause with a face like that, baby
It wont take too long
Keep on melting me with those eyes
And I think in a while Ill be hypnotized
Sitting here singing
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you I love you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, come a little closer
Oh, oh, I love you I love you
And Im down to my last breath
Trying to get my heels back under my head
Baby somewhere around the time
The moment I saw you
With your hair all sticking up
I was all caught up
Cause baby you were so damn cute
I need you to need me
See the train is coming for me
Help me, save me from this crash at last
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you I love you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, come a little closer
Oh, oh, I love you I love you
And Im down to my last breath
Trying to get my heels back under my head

Na na na na na na na na na na na
You seem to be just what Ive tried to find
And your name looks so good written next to mine
Next to mine
Next to mine
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you I love you
Ooh, ooh I really really want you
Oh, oh I love you I love you
Oh, oh..

Am I more than you bargained for yet?
Ive been dying to tell you anything you want to hear
Cause thats just who I am this week
Lie in the grass, next to the mausoleum
Im just a notch in your bedpost, but youre just a line in a song
Drop a heart, break a name
Were always sleeping in and sleeping for the wrong team
Were going down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, were going down swinging
Ill be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
Were going down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, were going down swinging
Ill be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
Fall Out Boys from Chicago!
Is this more than you bargained for yet?
Oh, dont mind me, Im watching you here from the closet
Wishing to be the friction in your jeans
Isnt it messed up how Im just dying to be him?
Im just a notch in your bedpost, but youre just a line in a song
Drop a heart, break a name
Were always sleeping in and sleeping for the wrong team

Were going down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, were going down swinging
Ill be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
Were going down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, were going down swinging
Ill be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it1Embed
No, I dont know what you mean
Im still the same girl
Picking daisies in the field
I believe in what I feel
Ive always been the same girl
Some moments change your life
This could be one of them
Im just living life and thinking
Hey this could be fun
Ive always been the same girl
Living in the same world
Singing little songs at the break of dawn girl
Sitting on the front porch
Do do do do do
Watching what you say girl
Never blow away girl
Living in the crazy world
Ive always been the same girl
I still live in one small town
But always love to move around
Ive always been the same girl
Still keep diaries that say
Where I was and did that day
Ive always been the same girl
Some moments change your life
This could be one of them
Im just living life and thinking
Hey this could be fun
Ive always been the same girl
Living in the same world
Singing little songs at the break of dawn girl
Sitting on the front porch
Do do do do do
Watching what you say girl
Never blow away girl
Living in the crazy world
Ive always been the same girl
Some days will change your life
Yeah this could be one of them
Im just living life and thinking...
Ive always been the same girl
Living in the same world
Singing little songs at the break of dawn girl
Sitting on the front porch
Do do do do do
Watching what you say girl
Never blow away girl
Living in the crazy world
Ive always been the same girl

I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that Im obsessive and crazy
Thats fine, Ill tell mine youre gay

Youre a redneck heartbreak whos really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as Im concerned, youre just another picture to burn
Well, theres no time for tears
Im just sitting here planning my revenge
Theres nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me

Youre a redneck heartbreak whos really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match an all my wasted time

Hes got a nice little life
Hes gonna live it, but on
Friday nights he plays that mandolin
Painted red, and he said
Its not the best I know
But its mine, Im gonna make it mine
People there cant help but care
About the friendly music of a guy
Whos getting by from their applause
Hes got a song that moves along
Hes got his local crowd tonight
At Angelinas family bar and grill
Hes got his heart on his sleeve
The songs he plays just living free
But who knows what goes through his mind
When he plays a song it brings along
Everybody saying
Whos that guy who plays the mandolin... mandolin
Oh yeah, mandolin
Got a car, got a scar
Like everyone hes got a few but
Everybody loves that mandolin
Got his problems, bills to pay
Somehow that boy finds a way
Through paychecks in tip jars, yeah

Hes got his heart on his sleeve
The songs he plays just living free
But who knows what goes through his mind
When he plays a song it brings along
Everybody saying
Whos that guy who plays the mandolin... mandolin
Oh yeah, mandolin
Oh hes the kind of guy
Who never really wanted fame
His feet are planted firmly on the ground
He never wanted people to remember his name
He never wanted word to get around
That he found heaven on earth
Hes got his heart on his sleeve
The songs he plays just living free
But who knows what goes through his mind
When he plays a song it brings along
Everybody saying
Whos that guy who plays the mandolin
Oh, Im the guy who plays the mandolin
Mandolin
Oh, mandolinEmbed
Standing on the border
Looking out into the great unknown
I can feel my heart beating faster as I step out on my own
Theres a new horizon and the promise of favorable wind
Im heading out tonight, traveling light
Im gonna start all over again
And buy a one-way ticket on a westbound train
See how far I can go
Cause Im gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I dont know
I will face the world around me
Knowing that Im strong enough to let you go
I will fall in love again
Because I can
Gonna climb the mountain
And look the eagle in the eye
And I wont let fear clip my wings and tell me how high I can fly
How could I have ever believed
That love had to be so blind
When freedom was waiting, down at the station
All I had to do was make up my mind

And buy a one-way ticket on a westbound train
See how far I can go
Cause Im gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I dont know
I will face the world around me
Knowing that Im strong enough to let you go
I will fall in love again
Because I can
Well, I have walked through the fire
And crawled on my knees through the valley of the shadow of doubt
Then the truth came shining like a light on me
And now I can see my way out
Buy a one-way ticket on a westbound train
See how far I can go
Cause Im gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I dont know
Buy a one-way ticket on a westbound train
Im gonna have my breakfast with some pink champagne
Gonna sail the ocean, gonna spread my wings
Gonna climb that mountain, gonna do everything
EverythingEmbed
Its strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
Yesterday I found out about you
Even now, just lookin at you feels wrong
You say that youd take it all back
Given one chance
It was a moment of weakness
And you said yes
You shouldve said no, you shouldve gone home
You shouldve thought twice fore you let it all go
You shouldve known that word
Bout what you did with her’d get back to me (Get back to me)
And I shouldve been there in the back of your mind
I shouldnt be asking myself why
You shouldnt be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You shouldve said no
Baby, and you might still have me
You can see that Ive been cryin
And baby, you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?

You say that the past is the past
You need one chance
It was a moment of weakness
And you said yes
You shouldve said no, you shouldve gone home
You shouldve thought twice fore you let it all go
You shouldve known that word
Bout what you did with her’d get back to me (Get back to me)
And I shouldve been there in the back of your mind
I shouldnt be asking myself why
You shouldnt be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You shouldve said no
Baby, and you might still have me
Oh, oh
I cant resist
Before you go, tell me this
Was it worth it?
Was she worth this?
No, no
No, no, no, no
You shouldve said no, you shouldve gone home
You shouldve thought twice fore you let it all go
You shouldve known that word
Bout what you did with her’d get back to me (Get back to me)
And I shouldve been there in the back of your mind
I shouldnt be asking myself why
You shouldnt be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You shouldve said no
Baby, and you might still have meEmbed
Days go by, I wonder if you hear me
Cant you read between the lines?
Now Im standing still, I am disappearing
Take this chance, Ill make you mine
Dont you wonder why
You change in time
Makes you feel so empty inside
But loves got me cornered in the back of the room
Im spinning around, Im spinning around
And all I see is someone I dont know
Loves got me tangled, tired me too
No sign of a wall, sign of wall
Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you
He tells lies, are you really thinking
That you deserve another try
When you see these eyes
You see another planet
Dont ask how, but fate decides

Dont you wonder why
You change in time
Makes you feel so empty inside
But loves got me cornered in the back of the room
Im spinning around, Im spinning around
And all I see is someone I dont know
Loves got me tangled, tired me too
No sign of a wall, sign of wall
Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you
Spinning and turning
And living and learning
I should be able to handle this
Make it or break it
Move it or shake it
Do it or fake it
Girl youve got to make it
But loves got me cornered in the back of the room
Im spinning around, Im spinning around
And all I see is someone I dont know
Loves got me tangled, tired me too
No sign of a wall, sign of wall
Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you
Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you
Spinning me around
And all I see is you2Embed
I ended up not having much to say
Said Today is for the lovers and the leaders
I hate to tell you, it just aint your day
So this is my rain song
Its cold outside and I still love you
Guess I was dead wrong
Youll find out when theres clouds above you
Finding it aint worth losing you
When it all comes down
It comes down to
This only rain song
Youre on my mind and I still love you
And its a complication with the voices
Rounding all around inside my mind
I used to think this heart had lots of choices
But they all lead to your doorstep every time
This is my rain song
Its cold outside and I still love you
Guess I was dead wrong
Youll find out when theres clouds above you
Finding it aint worth losing you
When it all comes down
It comes down to
This only rain song
Youre on my mind and I still love you
So this is my apology
My words, my tears, are all me
Laid out in front of you
Like a grasp for truth
On a Sunday afternoon
This is a song for you
This is my rain song
Its cold outside and I still love you
Guess I was dead wrong
And youll find out when theres clouds above you
Finding it aint worth losing you
When it all comes down
It comes down to
This only rain song
Youre on my mind and I still love you
Ooh
I still love you
I had a conversation with the mirror
It ended up not having much to sayEmbed
Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
But I knew you
Dancin in your Levis
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someones bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite
A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and
Giving me your weekends, I
I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes, I
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someones bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite
To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now Im bleedin
Cause I knew you
Steppin on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy, I
I knew you
Leavin like a father
Running like water, I
Cause when you are young, they assume you know nothing
But I knew youd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew youd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew Id curse you for the longest time
Chasin shadows in the grocery line
I knew youd miss me once the thrill expired
And youd be standin in my front porch light
And I knew youd come back to me
Youd come back to me
And youd come back to me
And youd come back
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someones bed
You put me on and said I was your favoriteEmbed
I was thinking bout her, thinking bout me
Thinking bout us, what we gon be
Open my eyes
It was only just a dream
So I travelled back down that road
Will she come back? No one knows
I realize it was only just a dream
I was at the top and now its like Im in the basement
Number one spot and now she find her a replacement
I swear now I cant take it, knowing somebodys got my baby
And now you aint around, baby, I cant think
I shouldve put it down, shouldve got the ring
Cause I can still feel it in the air
See her pretty face, run my fingers through her hair
My lover, my life, my shawty, my wife
She left me, Im tied
Cause I knew that it just aint right
I was thinking bout her, thinking bout me
Thinking bout us, what we gon be
Open my eyes
It was only just a dream
So I travelled back down that road
Will she come back? No one knows
I realize it was only just a dream

When I be ridin, man, I swear I see her face at every turn
Tryna get my Usher over I cant let it burn
And I just hope she know that shes the only one I yearn for
More and more I miss her. When will I learn?
Didnt give her all my love, I guess now I got my payback
Now Im in the club thinking all about my baby
Hey, she was so easy to love
But wait, I guess that love wasnt enough
Im going through it every time that Im alone
And now Im missing, wishing shed pick up the phone
But she made the decision that she wanted to move on
Cause I was wrong
I was thinking bout her, thinking bout me
Thinking bout us, what we gon be
Open my eyes
It was only just a dream
So I travelled back down that road
Will she come back? No one knows
I realize it was only just a dream
[Bridge: Nelly
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
And now theyre gone and youre wishing you could give them everything
Said if you ever loved somebody put your hands up
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
Now theyre gone and youre wishing you could give them everything
I was thinking bout her, thinking bout me
Thinking bout us, what we gon be
Open my eyes
It was only just a dream
So I travelled back down that road
Will she come back? No one knows
I realize it was only just a dream
I was thinking bout her, thinking bout me
Thinking bout us, what we gon be
Open my eyes
It was only just a dream
So I travelled back down that road
Will she come back? No one knows

You said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, thats a lie
Just a boy in a pickup truck
That had a funny way of getting stuck
On backroads at night
I was right there beside you all summer long
Then in time we woke up to find that summer gone
When you think Tim McGraw
Hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
The one you said you liked best
Next to my old faded pair of jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think me
September saw a month of tears
Thanking God that you werent here
To see me like that
In a box beneath my bed
Sits a letter that you never read
From three summers back

Its hard not to find it all bittersweet
But looking back on all of that its nice to believe
When you think Tim McGraw
Hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
The one you said you liked best
Next to my old faded pair of jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think me
Been back a couple times since then
And I didnt look you up
But some trains you cant catch again
You gotta leave it as it was
But when you think Tim McGraw
Hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
The one you said you liked best
Next to my old faded pair of jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
When you think Tim McGraw
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think me
You said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, thats a lieEmbed

We were in the backseat
Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar
I rent a place on Cornelia Street
I say casually in the car
We were a fresh page on the desk
Filling in the blanks as we go
As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
Leading us home
And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
Id never walk Cornelia Street again
Thats the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
Id never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, Im so terrified of if you ever walk away
Id never walk Cornelia Street again
Id never walk Cornelia Street again
Windows flung right open, autumn air
Jacket round my shoulders is yours
We bless the rains on Cornelia Street
Memorize the creaks in the floor
Back when we were card sharks, playing games
I thought you were leading me on
I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street
Before you even knew I was gone

But then you called, showed your hand
I turned around before I hit the tunnel
Sat on the roof, you and I
I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
Id never walk Cornelia Street again
Thats the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
Id never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, Im so terrified of if you ever walk away
Id never walk Cornelia Street again
Ill never walk Cornelia Street again
You hold my hand on the street
Walk me back to that apartment
Years ago, we were just inside
Barefoot in the kitchen
Sacred new beginnings
That became my religion, listen
I hope I never lose you
Id never walk Cornelia Street again
Oh, never again
‘Cause baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, Im so terrified of if you ever walk away
Id never walk Cornelia Street again
Id never walk Cornelia Street again
I dont wanna lose you
I dont wanna lose you
I rent a place on Cornelia Street
I say casually in the car1Embed
I think you fell off of your cloud today
You didnt see it coming or did you
You tried to please everybody
But the sweet breeze swept you away
The sun goes down on a good day
Tomorrow is still an unknown
You think youre all alone in this place
I think youre crazy cause I still love you baby
Oh dont fade away baby
Blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
Dont count the days as they leave you
Count them as you find a day new
Dont fade away
Never fade
Hard to breathe, nobody knows its you
Somebody blows your candle out
You wore a mask, now thats broken too
Everybody else was everything to you

The sun goes down on a good day
Tomorrow is still an unknown
You think everybody wants a fight
I think youre crazy cause I still love you baby
Oh dont fade away baby
Blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
Dont count the days as they leave you
Count them as you find a day new
Dont fade away
Never fade
I think you fell out of the sky today
I think you know its true
Youve seen the world, now all you see is me
Tell me now baby what are you gonna do
Oh dont fade away baby
Blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
Dont count the days as they leave you
Count them as you find a day new
Dont fade away
Dont fade away
Dont fade away
Never fade2Embed
There is some unbelievable music that has come out of artists who are from LA, did you know that?
Like Los Angeles has put out so many bands and artists that I’m such a fan of and
I’d love to play you some music I’m a fan of that’s come from LA, is that okay?
This one came out in 1981: 8 years before I was born and I love this song, it’s called “Bette Davis Eyes”
Her hair is Harlow gold
Her lips sweet surprise
Her hands are never cold
Shes got Bette Davis eyes
Shell turn her music on
You wont have to think twice
Shes pure as New York snow
She’s got Bette Davis eyes
And shell tease you
Shell unease you
All the better just to please you
Shes precocious and she knows just
What it takes to make a pro blush
She got Greta Garbo stand off sighs
Shes got Bette Davis eyes
Shell let you take her home
It whets her appetite
Shell lay you on her throne
She’s got Bette Davis eyes
Shell expose you
And just knows you
Off your feet with the crumbs she throws you
Shes ferocious and she knows just
What it takes to make a pro blush (ayy,ayy)
All the boys think shes a spy
Shes got Bette Davis eyesEmbed
Your feet under the table
I love it when theyre touching mine
Your hands make the crisps at the cradle
To tell me everything is fine
All I see is you looking at me
Do you know when you go
You make the sweetest sight at the window
If you had never come out of the blue
I would have stayed up and Made Up You
You smile just like a picture
It doesnt even need a frame
Sometimes I wait to answer
Just to hear you say my name
And all I want is just what Ive got
Do you know when you go
You make the sweetest sight at the window
If you had never come out of the blue
I would have stayed up and Made Up You

Id never let you go
Even If I could
Cause I never couldve dreamed you up this good
Do you know when you go
You make the sweetest sight at the window
If you had never come out of the blue
I would have stayed up and Made Up You
Made Up You
Oh oh
Made Up YouEmbed

Just another ex-love you dont wanna see
I dont wanna miss you like the other girls do
I dont wanna hurt you, I just wanna be
Drinking on a beach with you all over me
I know what they all say, yeah
But I aint tryna play

I wanna be your end game
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A-Team
I wanna be your end game, end game
I hit you like bang, we tried to forget it, but we just couldnt
And I bury hatchets, but I keep maps of where I put em
Reputation precedes me, they told you Im crazy
I swear I dont love the drama, it loves me
And I cant let you go, your hand prints on my soul
Its like your eyes are liquor, its like your body is gold
Youve been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks
So heres the truth from my red lips
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah
And you heard about me, ooh

I want it all to appear before my eyes when he smiles
Maybe Im wrong but I dont think Romeo would be my kind of guy
I want a love thats sweeter than roses
And for me this is how its gonna be
Like theres a fairytale guy
And he whispers sweet lullabies
And the music plays from nowhere
As we dance in the pale moonlight
With candles and fireflies all night
Everybody thinks about love
I want love they havent thought of yet
Here on the couch with a box of chocolates that I bought myself
Ill wait it out but sometimes my patience just needs a little help
Its what you get when your heartstrings are so tied
I dont regret it cause it needs to be perfect
Like theres a fairytale guy
And he whispers sweet lullabies
And he music plays from nowhere
As we dance in the pale moonlight
With candles and fireflies all night
Everybody thinks about love
I want love they havent thought of yet
I want my own little storybook ending
Well make it up as we go
Theres a fairytale guy
And he whispers sweet lullabies
And the music plays from nowhere
As we dance in the pale moonlight
With candles and fireflies all night
Everybody thinks about love
I want love they havent thought of yet
I want love they havent thought of yetEmbed
Here in my mind the sky looks the same
On every day you loved me
When we started home it started to rain
You put your coat around me
We stood there in the road
You held me so close
But did you ever let go
Down came the rain
Lightning and thunder
We tried in vain
To hold on to each other
Winds of change blew you away from me
Right here right now, I feel it on my skin
The bitter sting of what we could’ve been
Just when our love was like a burning flame
Down came the rain
In through the window I see her with you
I’m soaked to the skin, you’re warm and dry
I guess the storm is over for you
But look at the tears here in my eyes
I just stood there like a ghost
As you held her so close
And as I let you go

Down came the rain
Lightning and thunder
We tried in vain
To hold on to each other
Winds of change blew you away from me
Love like this changes who you are
Every kiss you gave me is a scar
Just when our love was like a burning flame
Down came the rain
All I need is to move on fast
But all I want is to have you back
And it just keeps falling…
Down came the rain
Lightning and thunder
We tried in vain
To hold on to each other
Winds of change blew you away from me
Right here right now, I feel it on my skin
The bitter sting of what we could’ve been
Just when our love was like a burning flame
Down came the rain
Down came the rainEmbed
Step one, you say, We need to talk.
He walks, you say, Sit down. Its just a talk.
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
Let him know that you know best
Cause after all you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things youve told him all along
Pray to God, he hears you
And I pray to God, he hears you
And where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or break with the ones youve followed
He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or hell say hes just not the same
And youll begin to wonder why you came
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a lifeEmbed
I like the way you wanted me
Every night for so long, baby
I like the way you needed me
Every time the things got rocky, yeah
I was believing in you
Was I mistaken?
Do you mean
Do you mean what you say?
When you say our love could last forever
Well, Id rather you be mean
Than love and lie
Id rather hear the truth
Than have to say goodbye
Id rather take a blow
At least then I would know
But baby dont you break my heart slow
I like the way youd hold me
Every night for so long, baby
I like the way youd sing to me
Every time the things got rocky, yeah

I was believing in you
Was I mistaken?
Do you say
Do you say what you mean?
When you say our love could last forever
Oh, yeah, yeah
Youd run around
And lead me on forever
While I stay at home
Still thinking were together
I want our love to last forever
But Id rather you be mean
Than love and lie
Id rather hear the truth
Than have to say goodbye
And Id rather take a blow
At least then I would know
But baby dont you break my heart slow
Now baby dont you break my heart
Slow2Embed
Standing on a street somewhere I dont wanna be
In a town thats made of stone
Some bad directions must have me here by mistake
Cause this sure aint what I call home
Let me close my eyes for a second
See if I can get out of here, and
Let my hair hang down, and I can feel the golden sun
And watch a pickup truck drive by
And I wanna tell the world how good it is to be right here
But I dont, I just sit under this tree
And Im in Tennessee
Standing on a road leading to a barn
With a cat named Eloise
Later on, well all go fishing in the pond
But all well catch is just a summer breeze
Let me close my eyes for a second
See if I can stay right here, and

Let my hair hang down, and I can feel the golden sun
And watch a pickup truck drive by
And I wanna tell the world how good it is to be right here
But I dont, I just sit under this tree
And Im in Tennessee
When the pond is gone and Eloise floats away
I find myself staring at the same old day
I need to go back, back to where I feel so free
Well, it looks like Im going back to Tennessee
I let my hair hang down, and I can feel the golden sun
And watch a pickup truck drive by
And I wanna tell the world how good it is to be right here
But I dont, I just sit under this tree
Just me and Eloise
And Im in TennesseeEmbed
look so sad? You feel 
 know you thought you had it
I know all about that
You had planned out, saw the 
You, Im a dreamer, too
Lost the but Ill be right 
And Ill take care of you
If you get knocked off your feet
Ill try to see it coming
Ill get a symphony to play that song 
Pick you up, take your hand, stop your crying
Theres no chance you wont make it through
Im looking out for you
Beneath those scared eyes
Theres something wonderful
That you dont know you have
I know youre scared but Id pass up a miracle
Just to hear you laugh
If you get tired of me, Ill pretend to let you go
If you need room to breathe, step back and watch you go
Sweet child, youve seen better days
But you know its gonna be okay
Show me that smile you got from your father
Its gonna be fine just because you got my love, you got my loveEmbed
Hey, dont write yourself off yet
Its only in your head, you feel left out or looked down on
Just try your best, try everything you can
Dont you worry what they tell themselves when youre away
It just takes some time, little girl, youre in the middle of the ride
Everything, everything will be just fine
Everything, everything will be alright, alright
Hey, you know theyre all the same
You know youre doing better on your own
So dont buy in love right now
Just be yourself, it doesnt matter if its good enough for someone else
It just takes some time, little girl, youre in the middle of the ride
Everything, everything will be just fine
Everything, everything will be alright(x2)
Hey, dont write yourself off yet
Its only in your head, you feel left out or looked down on
Just do your best, do everything you can
Dont you worry what their bitter hearts are gonna say

It just takes some time, little girl, youre in the middle of the ride
Everything, everything will be just fine
Everything, everything will be alrightEmbed

Walking downtown shuffling my feet
I try to dream my dreams above the concrete
Store windows, traveled for miles
But something I passed really caught my eye
It was cracked down the middle, permanent scars
But I fell in love with this here guitar
Nice to meet you, can I teach you
All I know, can you show me what you do
Where have you been
What have you seen
Who were you before you even knew me
Have you been played for endless hours
Or were you left in the corner
Or were you someones best friend
This here guitar
It was my baby, anyone could see
I love the cracks, the curves, the hidden beauty
But I cant help wondering why
It came to me and where well say goodbye
The cracks down the middle
Cant see where they are
Since I fell in love with this here guitar

Nice to meet you, can I teach you
All I know, can you show me what you do
Where have you been
What have you seen
Who were you before you even knew me
Have you been played for endless hours
Or were you left in the corner
Or were you someones best friend
This here guitar
Were you a present from a father to a son?
Did he forget you
Or just play you til you came undone?
Hey, did some primadonna love you
Til she got her fame and fortune?
I wont do that to you
Nice to meet you, can I teach you
All I know, can you show me what you do
Where have you been?
What have you seen?
Who were you before you even knew me?
Have you been played for endless hours
Or were you left in the corner
Or were you someones best friend?
This here guitar
Youre my guitar
This here guitar1Embed
If I could be sweet
I would but first of all, let me say
I must apologize for acting stank and treating you this way
Cause Ive been acting like sour milk all on the floor
Its like you didnt shut the refrigerator
Maybe thats the reason Ive been acting so cold
If I could escape
And recreate a place thats my own world
And I could be your favorite girl
Forever, perfectly together
Now tell me boy now wouldnt that be sweet
If I could be sweet
Sorry, but I know Ive been a real bad girl
I didnt mean for you to get hurt
Whatsoever
We can make it better
Now tell me boy now wouldnt that be sweet
Sweet escape, sweet escape
You let me drown
Im at my lowest boiling point
Come help me out
I need to get me out of this joint
Come on, lets bounce
Counting on you to turn me around
Instead of clowning around
Lets look for some common ground
Oh baby
Times been getting a little crazy
Ive been getting a little lazy
Waiting for you to come save me
I can see that youre angry
By the way that you treat me
Hopefully, you dont leave me
Wanna take you with me

If I could escape
And recreate a place thats my own world
And I could be your favorite girl
Forever, perfectly together
Now tell me boy now wouldnt that be sweet
If I could be sweet
Sorry, but I know Ive been a real bad girl
I didnt mean for you to get hurt
Whatsoever
We can make it better
Now tell me boy now wouldnt that be sweet
Sweet escape, sweet escapeEmbed
There you are
Standin there like you don’t know what to say
And I move like this
Here I am, racing myself, I wanna know whats coming now, what a waste
(Pre-Chorus)
Well all of that time, I thought you were mine
Was I just kidding myself?
For letting it go, and loving you so, dont you dare tell me not to look at you like that
(Chorus)
Gonna look at you like that, I’m gonna hang my head and turn my back, to your sneak attack, and if its the last thing that I do, Im gonna make this hard on you while I, look at you like that
(Verse 2)
Wont you say, that we can still be friends
It doesnt work that way
And dont you dare think, that a pack of all my tears can take that
Crying out when Im alone
(Pre-Chorus)
Doing right here, Im crying right now, you can watch me crumble down, that’s for breaking my heart, so baby don’t stop, thinking you could ask me not to look at you like, that
(Chorus)
Gonna look at you like that, Im gonna hang my head and turn my back, to your sneak attack, and if it’s the last thing that I do, Im gonna make this hard on you while I, look at you like that
(Bridge)
Dont you tell me to be strong, and make it harder than it has to be, after you dont call, and remember what you’ve done to me
(Chorus)
Cause Im gonna look at you like that, gonna hang my head and turn my back, to your sneak attack, and if its the last thing that I do, after what you put me through, Im gonna have to let you know,
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh yeah
Gonna look at you like that
Look at you, Look at you, Look at you, like that
Nah nah nah, nah nah nah, nah nah nah nah nah nah nah..Embed
I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered for just us to know
You told me you loved me
So why did you go away?
Away
I do recall now, the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement
I ran off the plane
That July ninth
The beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt
I can still feel your arms
But now Ill go
Sit on the floor, wearing your clothes
All that I know is I dont know how to be something you miss
I never thought wed have a last kiss
I never imagined wed end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

I still remember the swing of your step
The life of the party, youre showing off again
And Id roll my eyes and then youd pull me in
Im not much for dancing, but for you, I did
Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something
Theres not a day I dont miss those rude interruptions
And Ill go
Sit on the floor, wearing your clothes
All that I know is I dont know
How to be something you miss
I never thought wed have a last kiss
I never imagined wed end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips, ooh
So Ill watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
And Ill keep up with our old friends
Just to ask them how you are
Hope its nice where you are
And I hope the sun shines and its a beautiful day
And something reminds you, you wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind
So, Ill go
Sit on the floor, wearing your clothes
All that I know is I dont know
How to be something you miss
I never thought wed have a last kiss
I never imagined wed end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips
Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips
Just like our lastEmbed
Im like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never wouldve known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
Im begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, thats my man
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was onе prize Id cheat to win
The morе that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
Im begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, thats my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
Im begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, thats my man

Life was a willow, and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow, and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a 90s trend
Wait for the signal, and Ill meet you after dark (dark)
Show me the places where the others gave you scars (scars)
Now this is an open-shut case
I guess I shouldve known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
Im begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, thats my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
Im begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, thats my man
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
Im begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, thats my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
Im begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, thats my man
Hey, thats my man
Thats my man
Yeah, thats my man
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
Thats my man
Hey, thats my man
Im begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, thats my man3Embed
Guess mine is not the first heart broken
My eyes are not the first to cry
Im not the first to know
Theres just no getting over you
You know Im just a fool whos willing
To sit around and wait for you
But, baby, cant you see
Theres nothing else for me to do?
Im hopelessly devoted to you
But now theres nowhere to hide
Since you pushed my love aside
Im out of my head
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you
My head is saying, Fool, forget him
My heart is saying, Dont let go
Hold on till the end
And thats what I intend to do
Im hopelessly devoted to you

But now theres nowhere to hide
Since you pushed my love aside
Im out of my head
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to youEmbed

Mix a special groove
Put fire inside of you
Anytime you feel danger or fear
Then instantly
I will appear

Anything you want done baby
I do it naturally

Im every woman
Its all in me

And when it comes down to some good old fashioned love
I got it, I got it
I got it, got it, yeah, yeah
Im every woman

Anything you want done baby

My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
Everyone looked worse in the light
There are so many lines that Ive crossed unforgiven
Ill tell you the truth, but never goodbye
I dont wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I dont wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
Been sleeping so long in a twenty-year dark night
But now I see daylight
I only see daylight
Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
So I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
Maybe Ive stormed out of every single room in this town
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because its morning now
Its brighter now, now
I dont wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
I dont wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things Im never gonna say)
Been sleeping so long in a twenty-year dark night
(Now Im wide awake)
But now I see daylight
I only see daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight

And I can still see it all in my mind
All of you, all of me intertwined
I once believed love would be black and white
But its golden golden
And I can still see it all in my head
Back and forth from New York, sneaking in your bed
I once believed love would be burning red
But its golden
Like daylight, like daylight
Like daylight, like daylight
I dont wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
I dont wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things Im never gonna say)
Been sleeping so long in a twenty-year dark night
(Now Im wide awake)
But now I see daylight
I only see daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
You gotta step into the daylight and let it go
Just let it go, let it goEmbed
Look, if you had one shot, or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted, in one moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?
Yo, his palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
Theres vomit on his sweater already: Moms spaghetti
Hes nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words wont come out
Hes choking, how? Everybodys joking now
The clocks run out, times up, over—blaow!
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You make me smile like the sun
Fall outta bed
Sing like a bird
Dizzy in my head
Spin like a record
Crazy on a Sunday night
You make me dance like a fool
Forget how to breathe
Shine like gold
Buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild
Oh, you make me smileEmbed
Any day now, theyre talking war
I can see the look thats in your eyes
Theyre not talking a week or two
Oh, daddy can I go with you?
Oh, daddy can I go with you?
You pack a suitcase, take a picture from the wall
I always knew this time would come
When I ask how long you think youre going to be
You say, this crazy worlds come undone
Summers over and leaves begin to fall
And another winters on the way
I knew I wasnt going to take this very well
But Id give anything to have you here today
Everyday now theyre talking war
& I know this time is like its never been before
Were not talking about a week or two
Oh, daddy can I go with you?
Oh, daddy can I go with you?
Oh, daddy can I go with you?Embed
Im doing good, Im on some new shit
Been saying yes instead of no
I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didnt though
I hit the ground running each night
I hit the Sunday matinée
You know the greatest films of all time were never made
I guess you never know, never know
And if you wanted me, you really shouldve showed
And if you never bleed, youre never gonna grow
And its alright now
But we were something, dont you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishеs came true
It wouldve been you
In my dеfense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it wouldve been fun
If you wouldve been the one
I have this dream youre doing cool shit
Having adventures on your own
You meet some woman on the internet and take her home
We never painted by the numbers, baby
But we were making it count
You know the greatest loves of all time are over now

I guess you never know, never know
And its another day waking up alone
But we were something, dont you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It wouldve been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it wouldve been fun
If you wouldve been the one
I, I, I persist and resist the temptation to ask you
If one thing had been different
Would everything be different today?
We were something, dont you think so?
Rosé flowing with your chosen family
And it wouldve been sweet
If it couldve been me
In my defense, I have none
For digging up the grave another time
But it wouldve been fun
If you wouldve been the one
(Ooh, ooh)Embed
Of the kid in the crowd
Who cut me down to size
Realizing is crying out loud
For every kid on stage
Theres a kid in the crowdEmbed
To the times I learned, by watching you sing along to every song, that my greatest triumph in life has been finding the ones who like me for me. And that even in your worst times, they can see the best in you.
Heres to the musical family I get to share the stage with and all the things theyve sacrificed in their lives to be able to sing, play, and dance as well as they do. Heres to our extraordinary crew and the days they spend away from the ones they love so that we can stand under the lights and play for you. Heres to the people who work at these stadiums and help clean up the glitter on the floor after the party.
Heres to getting smarter and harder in the nick of time, but still remaining delicate enough to care deeply for the ones you can trust, and brave enough to stay when its hard or its wrong or were making mistakes. Heres to life teaching us lessons, and us learning, growing, dancing, and changing together. Everything Ive learned about a reputation and how little it really means when defined by those who do not know you, Ive learned from the fans whose spirits lit up these stadiums.
Thanks to you, Im doing better than I ever was.
Love,

Betty, I wont make assumptions
About why you switched your homeroom, but
I think its cause of me
Betty, one time I was riding on my skateboard
When I passed your house
Its like I couldnt breathe
You heard the rumors from Inez
You cant believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go straight to hell
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust mе
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
Im only seventeen, I dont know anything
But I know I miss you
Bеtty, I know where it all went wrong
Your favorite song was playing
From the far side of the gym
I was nowhere to be found
I hate the crowds, you know that
Plus, I saw you dance with him

You heard the rumors from Inez
You cant believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go straight to hell
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
Im only seventeen, I dont know anything
But I know I miss you
I was walking home on broken cobblestones
Just thinking of you when she pulled up like
A figment of my worst intentions
She said James, get in, lets drive
Those days turned into nights
Slept next to her, but
I dreamt of you all summer long
Betty, Im here on your doorstep
And I planned it out for weeks now
But its finally sinkin in
Betty, right now is the last time
I can dream about what happens when
You see my face again
The only thing I wanna do
Is make it up to you
So I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party
Will you have me? Will you love me?
Will you kiss me on the porch
In front of all your stupid friends?
If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?
Will it patch your broken wings?
Im only seventeen, I dont know anything
But I know I miss you
Standing in your cardigan
Kissin in my car again
Stopped at a streetlight
You know I miss youEmbed
You are somebody that I dont know
But youre takin shots at me like its Patrón
And Im just like, damn, its 7 AM
Say it in the street, thats a knock-out
But you say it in a Tweet, thats a cop-out
And Im just like, Hey, are you okay?
And I aint tryna mess with your self-expression
But Ive learned a lesson that stressin and obsessin bout somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, youre being too loud
And Im just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on my gown?
You need to calm down
You are somebody that we dont know
But youre comin at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD)
Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Makin that sign mustve taken all night

You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
Cause shade never made anybody less gay
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, youre being too loud
And Im just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on his gown?
You need to calm down
And we see you over there on the internet
Comparing all the girls who are killing it
But we figured you out
We all know now we all got crowns
You need to calm down
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down (You need to calm down)
Youre being too loud (Youre being too loud)
And Im just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop (Can you stop?)
Like can you just not step on our gowns?
You need to calm downEmbed
When you think of all the late nights
Late fights over the phone
Wake up in the mornin
With someone, but feeling alone
A heart is drawn round your name
In someones handwriting, not mine
Were sneakin out into town
Holdin hands, just killing time
Your past and mine are parallel lines
Stars all aligned, they intertwined
And taught you the way you call me baby
Treat me like a lady, all that I can say is
All of the girls youve loved before (Ooh)
Made you the one Ivе fallen for
Every dead-еnd street led you straight to me
Now, youre all I need, Im so thankful for
All of the girls youve loved before
And I love you more
When I think of all the makeup
Fake love out on the town (Ooh)
Cryin in the bathroom for some dude
Whose name I cannot remember now

Secret jokes all alone
No ones home, sixteen and wild (Ooh)
Were breakin up, makin up
Leave without saying goodbye (Ooh)
Just know that its everything that made me
Now, I call you baby, thats why youre so amazing
All of the girls youve loved before (Ooh)
Made you the one Ive fallen for
Every dead-end street led you straight to me
Now, youre all I need, Im so thankful for
All of the girls youve loved before
And I love you more
Your mother brought you up loyal and kind
Teenage love taught you theres good in goodbye
Every woman that you knew brought you here
I wanna teach you how forever feels like
The girls youve loved before (Ooh)
Made you the one Ive fallen for
Every dead-end street (Every dead-end street) led you straight to me (Straight to me)
Now, youre all I need (All I need), Im so thankful for
All of the girls youve loved before
I love you more1Embed
I would be complex, I would be cool
Theyd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to
And that would be okay for me to do
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you
Id be a fearless leader
Id be an alpha type
When everyone believes ya
Whats that like?
Im so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if Id get there quicker if I was a man
And Im so sick of them coming at me again
Cause if I was a man, then Id be the man
Id be the man
Id be the man
Theyd say I hustled, put in the work
They wouldnt shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve
What I was wearing, or if I was rude
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves

And they would toast to me, oh
Let the players play
Id be just like Leo in Saint-Tropez
Im so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if Id get there quicker if I was a man
And Im so sick of them coming at me again
Cause if I was a man, then Id be the man
Id be the man
Id be the man, yeah
Whats it like to brag about raking in dollars
And getting bitches and models?
And its all good if youre bad
Its okay if youre mad
If I was out flashing my dollars
Id be a bitch, not a baller
Theyd paint me out to be bad
So, its okay that Im mad
Im so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if Id get there quicker if I was a man
You know that Im so sick of them coming at me again
Cause if I was a man, then Id be the man
Id be the man, yeah
Yeah, Id be the man, yeah
Oh, Id be the man
Id be the man
If I was a man
Then Id be the manEmbed
Absolutely love this one, right? This is sort of a... its not a short speech, so, just, I dont want this to slip and break, cause its very important to me.
Thank you so much. Shes so supportive. We all need someone like that. Im Taylor, good evening. I wanna first thank Billboard from the bottom of my heart for this honor, for -
Whoa, this is going great so far. Excellent, okay. I wanna say thank you so much to Billboard for giving me this honor, for naming me as their Woman of the Decade. So, what does it mean to be the Woman of this Decade? Well, it means Ive seen a lot. When this decade began, I was 20 years old, and I had put out my self-titled debut album when I was 16. And then the album that would become my breakthrough album, which was called Fearless, and I saw that there was a world of music and experience beyond country music that I was really curious about. I saw pop stations send my songs Love Story and You Belong With Me to number one for the first time.
And I saw that as a female in this industry, some people will always have slight reservations about you. Whether you deserve to be there. Whether your male producer or co-writer is the reason for your success. Or whether it was a savvy record label; it wasnt. I saw that people love to explain away a womans success in the music industry, and I saw something in me change due to this realization. This was the decade when I became a mirror for my detractors. Whatever they decided I couldnt do is exactly what I did.
Huh, Ill take it, thanks! Whatever they criticized about me became material for musical satires or inspirational anthems, and the best lyrical examples I can think of are songs like Mean, Shake It Off, and Blank Space. Basically, if people had something to say about me, I usually said something back in my own way. And this reflex dictated more than just my lyrics. When Fearless did win Album of the Year at the Grammys, and I did become the youngest solo artist to ever win the award, with that win, came criticism and backlash in 2010 that Id never experienced before as a young, new artist. All of a sudden, people had doubts about my singing voice. Was it strong enough? Was I a little bit pitchy? All of a sudden, they werent sure if I was the one writing the songs because sometimes in the past I had had co-writers in the room.
At that time, I couldnt understand why this wave of harsh criticism had hit me so hard. I believe a popular headline back then was A Swift Backlash, which is clever, you gotta give it to them. And now I realize that this is just what happens to a woman in music if she achieves success or power beyond peoples comfort level. I now have come to expect that with good news, comes some sort of pushback, but I didnt know that then.
So then, I decided that I would be the only songwriter on my third album, Speak Now, and that I would tour constantly, work on my vocals every day, and perfect my stamina in a live show. I decided I would be what they said I couldnt be. I didnt know then that, soon enough, people would decide on something else I wasnt quite doing right, and then the circle would keep going on and on, and rolling along, and I would keep accommodating, over-correcting, in an effort to appease my critics.
Theyre saying Im dating too much in my twenties? Okay, Ill stop. Ill just be single... for years. Now theyre saying my album Red is filled with too many break-up songs? Okay, Ill make one about moving to New York, and deciding that really my life is more fun with just my friends. Oh, theyre saying my music is changing too much for me to stay in country music? Alright, okay, heres an entire genre shift, and a pop album called 1989.
Oh, you heard it? Sick! Now its that Im showing you too many pictures of me with my friends. Okay, I can stop doing that, too. Now Im actually a calculated, manipulator rather than a smart businesswoman? Okay, Ill disappear from public view... for years. Now Im being cast as a villain to you? Okay, heres an album called reputation and there are lots of snakes everywhere.
In the last ten years, I have watched as women in this industry are criticized, and measured up to each other, and picked at for their bodies, their romantic lives, their fashion. Or, have you ever heard someone say, about a male artist, I really like his songs, but I dont know what it is, theres just something about him I dont like. No! That criticism is reserved for us. But, you know, Ive learned that the difference between those who can continue to create in that climate usually comes down to this: who lets that scrutiny break them, and who just keeps making art. Ive watched as one of my favorite artists of this decade, Lana Del Rey, was ruthly criticized -
Yes! Yeah, thank you. We have similar tastes, I like it. She was ruthlessly criticized in her early career, and then slowly but surely, she turned into, in my opinion, the most influential artist in pop. Her vocal stylings, her lyrics, her aesthetics, theyve been echoed and repurposed in every corner in music. And this year, her incredible album is nominated for Album of the Year at the Grammys, because she just kept making art. And that example should inspire all of us. That the only way forward, is forward motion. That we shouldnt let obstacles like criticism slow down the creative forces that drive us.
And I see that fire in the newer faces in our music industry, whose work I absolutely love. I see it in Lizzo, Rosalía, Tayla Parx, Hayley Kiyoko, King Princess, Camila Cabello, Halsey, Megan Thee Stallion, Princess Nokia, Nina Nesbitt, Sigrid, Normani, H.E.R., Maggie Rogers, Becky G, Dua Lipa, Ella Mai, Billie Eilish, and so many other amazing women who are making music right now.
Female artists in music have dominated this decade in growth, streaming, record and ticket sales, and critical acclaim. So why are we doing so well? Because we have to grow fast, we have to work this hard, we have to prove that we deserve this, and we have to top our last achievements. Women in music, onstage, or behind the scenes, are not allowed to coast. We are held at a higher, sometimes impossible-feeling standard. And it seems that my fellow female artists have taken this challenge, and they have accepted it. It seems like the pressure that couldve crushed us made us into diamonds instead. And what didnt kill us actually did make us stronger. But we need to keep advocating for women in the recording studios, behind the mixing board, in A&R meetings, because rather than fighting to be taken seriously in their fields, these women are still struggling to even have a chance to be in the room.
We now find ourselves fully immersed in a vast frontier that wasnt around last decade, and that is the streaming world. In music, were always walking hand-in-hand with technology. And sometimes that is so awesome, like how now were able to just drop a song that we made yesterday. Ive spoken out in the past about the future of revenue flow for creators, and the songwriters and producers who are being left behind due to these rapid shifts and changes. I still dont think that record contracts or producers agreements have fully caught up. And I hope that in the next decade, we can keep searching for the right solution for producers, songwriters, and creators. Dont you?
Lately, theres been a new shift that has affected me personally, and that I feel is a potentially harmful force in our industry. And as your resident loud person, I feel the need to bring it up: And that is the unregulated world of private equity coming in, and buying up our music, as if it is real estate. As if its an app, or a shoe line. This just happened to me without my approval, consultation, or consent. After I was denied the chance to purchase my music outright, my entire catalogue was sold to Scooter Brauns Ithaca Holdings in a deal that Im told was funded by the Soros family, 23 Capital and the Carlyle Group.
Yet, to this day, none of these investors have ever bothered to contact me or my team directly, to perform their due diligence on their investment, on their investment in me, to ask how I might feel about the new owner of my art. The music I wrote, the videos I created, photos of me, my handwriting, my album designs. And of course, Scooter never contacted me or my team to discuss it prior to the sale, or even when it was announced.
Im fairly certain he knew how I would feel about it, though, and let me just say that the definition of the toxic male privilege in our industry is people saying, But hes always been nice to me! when Im raising valid concerns about artists and their right to own their music. And of course hes nice to you. If youre in this room, you have something he needs. The fact is that private equity is what enabled this man to think, according to his own social media post, that he could buy me, but Im obviously not going willingly.
Yet, the most amazing thing was to discover that it would be the women in our industry who would have my back and show me the most vocal support at one of the most difficult times, and I will never, ever forget it. Like, ever.
But to conclude, I will say that in ten years, Ive seen forward steps in our industry. In our awareness, our inclusion, our ability to start calling out unfairness and misconduct. Ive seen the advent of social media, the way it can boost the breakthrough of emerging artists. And Ive seen fans become more engaged and supportive than ever before. Ive leaned on that support, and it has kept me in a place where, no matter what, I always wanted to keep making music for them.
I was up on a stage in New York City in 2014, accepting Billboard Woman of the Year, and I was talking about the future of streaming. How we needed to make sure that the female artists, writers, and producers of the next generation were protected and compensated fairly. This was before my record deal with Universal, last year, that would contractually guarantee that the artists on their roster be paid upon any sale of their Spotify shares, unrecupable. So, thank you for that.
This speech Im referring to was on my 25th birthday. Im about to turn thirty tonight, woo! But my exact quote during this speech was, I really just feel like we need to continue to try to offer something to a younger generation of musicians. Because somewhere, right now, your future Woman of the Year is probably sitting in a piano lesson, or in a girls choir. And today, right now, we need to take care of her. Ive since learned that, at that exact moment, an 11-year old girl in California really was taking piano lessons, and really was in a girls choir. And this year, she has been named Woman of the Year at the age of seventeen. Her name is Billie.
And those are the stories we need to think about every day as we do our jobs in this industry. The ones where peoples dreams come true and they get to create music and play it for people. The ones where fans feel a connection to music that makes their day easier, makes their night more fun, makes their love feel more sacred, or their heartache feel less isolating. The ones where all of you in this room stand as an example for someone else in the next generation who loves the same thing that we love: music. And no matter what else enters the conversation, we will bring it back to music.
And as for me, lately Ive been focusing less on doing what they say I cant do and more on doing whatever the hell I want. Thank you for a magnificent, happy, free, confused, sometimes lonely, but mostly golden decade. Im honored to be here tonight, I feel very lucky to be with you, thank you so much.2Embed
Im pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room, at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn-away
But you stayed
This morning I said we should talk about it
Cause Ive read you should never leave a fight unresolved
Thats when you came in wearing a football helmet
And said okay, lets talk
And I said
Stay, stay, stay
Ive been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that its funny when Im mad, mad, mad
So I think that its best if we both stay
Before you Id only dated self-indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now Im always laughing
And I love you because you have given me no choice but to
Stay, stay, stay
Ive been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that its funny when Im mad, mad, mad
So I think that its best if we both stay
Stay, stay, stay
You took the time to memorize me
My fears, my hopes, and dreams
I just like hanging out with you all the time
All those times that you didnt leave
Its been occurring to me
Id like to hang out with you for my whole life
Ho, hey, ho, hey
So show your family
All the blood that I would bleed
I dont know where I belong
I dont know where I went wrong
But I can write a song
I belong with you
You belong with me
Youre my sweetheart 
I belong with you
You belong with me
Youre my sweetheart
I belong with you
You belong with me
Youre my sweetheart
I belong with you 
You belong with me 
So please, please
Stay, stay, stay
Ill be loving you for quite some time
No one else is gonna love me when I get mad, mad, mad
So I think that its best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay
Ive been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that its funny when Im mad, mad, mad
So I think that its best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay
Ive been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that its funny when Im mad, mad, mad
So I think that its best if we both stayEmbed
All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around
Ive been giving out chances every time
And all you do is let me down
And its taken me this long baby but I figured you out
And youre thinking well be fine again
But not this time around
You dont have to call anymore
I wont pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Dont wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that youre sorry
But I dont believe you, baby, like I did before
Youre not sorry, no, no
Youre looking so innocent
I might believe you if I didnt know
Couldve loved you all my life if you didnt leave me waiting in the cold
Youve got your share of secrets
And Im tired of being last to know
And now youre asking me to listen
Cause its worked each time before

But you dont have to call anymore
I wont pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Dont wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that youre sorry
But I dont believe you, baby, like I did before
Youre not sorry, no
Youre not sorry, no
You had me crawling for you, honey
And it never wouldve gone away, no
You used to shine so bright, but I watched all of it fade
Dont wanna think about it
Dont wanna talk about it
Im just so sick about it
Cant believe its ending this way
Im so confused about it 
Feeling the blues about it
I just cant do without ya
Wont you tell me, is this fair?
Is this the way its really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Shouldve known better when you came around
That you were gonna make me cry
Its breaking my heart to watch you go around
Cause I know that youre living a lie
But thats okay, baby
Cause in time you will find
What goes around, goes around
Comes around, comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around
Comes around, comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around
Comes around, comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around
Comes around, comes all the way back around 
What goes around, goes around
Comes around, comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around 
Comes around, comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around
Comes around, comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around
Comes around, comes all the way back around
You dont have to call anymore
I wont pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Dont wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that youre sorry
But I dont believe you, baby, like I did before
Youre not sorry, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
You spend your nights alone
And she never comes home
And when you call her up, all you gets a busy tone
And shes doing to you, what you did to me
A tale as old as time
Boy, you got what you deservedEmbed
Told you Ill be here forever
Said Ill always be your friend
Took an oath, Imma stick it out to the end
Now that its raining more than ever
Know that well still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella
(Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh)
Under my umbrella
(Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh)
You have my heart
And well never be worlds apart
I may be in magazines
But youll still be my star
Baby, ‘cause in the dark
You cant see shiny cars
And thats when you need me there
With you Ill always share
Because
When the sun shine, well shine together
Told you Ill be here forever
Said Ill always be your friend
Took an oath, Imma stick it out till the end
Now that its raining more than ever
Know that well still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella
(Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh)
Under my umbrella

Ive been having a hard time adjusting
I had the shiniest wheels, now theyre rusting
I didnt know if youd care if I came back
I have a lot of regrets about that
Pulled the car off the road to the lookout
Couldve followed my fears all the way down
And maybe I dont quite know what to say
But Im here in your doorway
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
They told me all of my cages were mental
So I got wasted like all my potential
And my words shoot to kill when Im mad
I have a lot of regrets about that
I was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere
Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here
Pouring out my heart to a stranger
But I didnt pour the whiskey
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying

At least Im trying
And its hard to be at a party when I feel like an open wound
Its hard to be anywhere these days when all I want is you
Youre a flashback in a film reel on the one screen in my town
And I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
At least Im tryingEmbed
Lembrei desse sentimento
Gritando dentro de nós
Éramos todos meninos
Em cada um, vivia uma paixão
Como uma cena de um filme
Vencemos pesadelos enfrentando os dragões
Criados por nossos medos
Fruto da imaginação
De frente a uma nova era
Na onda de uma canção
Nós construímos história
Mente, alma e coração
Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, Long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered
I said, Remember this feeling
I passed the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there
On the side-lines, wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town

De frente a uma nova era
Na onda de uma canção
Nós construímos história
Mente, alma e coração
Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, Long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders, Im not afraid
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, Long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered
Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall
Lembrei do momento
Que fiz promessa pra nós dois
Pintando o nosso destino
Puro, simples, pleno e sem fim
Que fosse assim sem um goodbye
Fosse para sempre Eu cheguei
Os sonhos que construímos
Me vi feliz, eu te achei
Será muito mais que achar
Será muito além de pensar
Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you
Long, long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, Long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders, Im not afraid
Singing, long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
And long, long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be rememberedEmbed
Is it romantic how all my elegies eulogize me?
Im not cut out for all these cynical clones
These hunters with cell phones
Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I dont belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
Im setting off, but not without my muse
What should be over burrowеd under my skin
In heart-stopping waves of hurt
Ivе come too far to watch some namedropping sleaze
Tell me what are my words worth
Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I dont belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
Im setting off, but not without my muse
I want auroras and sad prose
I want to watch wisteria grow right over my bare feet
Cause I havent moved in years
And I want you right here
A red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground
With no one around to tweet it
While I bathe in cliffside pools
With my calamitous love and insurmountable grief

Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I dont belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
Im setting off, but not without my muse
No, not without you
No, not without you1Embed
Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
Get drunk, but its not enough
Cause the morning comes and youre not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandeliers still flickering here
Cause I cant pretend its okay when its not
Its death by a thousand cuts
I dress to kill my time, I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if itll be alright
They say, I dont know
And what once was ours is no ones now
I see you everywhere, the only thing we share
Is this small town
You said it was a great love, one for the ages
So if the storys over, why am I still writing pages?
Cause saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
Get drunk, but its not enough
Cause the morning comes and youre not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandeliers still flickering here
Cause I cant pretend its okay when its not
Its death by a thousand cuts

My heart, my hips, my body, my love
Tryna find a part of me that you didnt touch
Gave up on me like I was a bad drug
Now Im searching for signs in a haunted club
Our songs, our films, united we stand
Our country, guess it was a lawless land
Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
Paper cut stings from our paper-thin plans
My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust
Tryna find a part of me you didnt take up
Gave you too much, but it wasnt enough
But Ill be alright, its just a thousand cuts
Get drunk, but its not enough
Cause youre not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandeliers still flickering here
Cause I cant pretend its okay when its not
No, its not
Its death by a thousand cuts
Part of me that you didnt touch
My body, my love, my trust
But it wasnt enough, it wasnt enough, no, no
I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if itll be alright
They say, I dont knowEmbed

You turn your dial to 93.7
Broadway acts like hes 11
Self-proclaimed
Says hes the worst mistake ever to land in Michigan
Im just a singer of country songs
Just trying to play guitar and not do no wrong
But if you listen to just one thing I say
You should turn Z93 on
Broadways Electric Barnyard
I sing a song called Tim McGraw
Request it and theyll play it all day long
I sing in stations all day long
But theres nothing like when youre on
The Electric Barnyard
Daisys from a trailer park in St. Louis
Growing up not wearing any shoes
Prettiest hillbilly girl youll see all day
Growing up the other trailer park girls
Couldnt hide their jealousy
Because she had the only phone for miles
Now she uses it as a DJ

So you should turn Z93 on
Broadways Electric Barnyard
I sing a song called Tim McGraw
Request it and theyll play it all day long
I sing in stations all day long
But theres nothing like when youre onEmbed

I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And troubles gonna follow where I go
(And theres a lot of cool chicks out there)

And when we had that fight out in the rain
You ran after me and called my name
I never wanna see you walk away
(And theres a lot of lame guys out there)
Cause one of these things is not like the others
Livin in winter, I am your summer
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover

It was painted red, the stripe was white
It was 18 feet from bow to stern light
Secondhand from a dealer in Atlanta
I rode up with daddy when he went there to get her
We put on a shine, put on a motor
Built out of love, and made for the water
Ran her for years, until the transom got rotten
A piece of my childhood will never be forgotten
It was just an old plywood boat
75 Johnson and an electric choke
A young girl, two hands on the wheel
I cant replace the way it made me feel
And I would turn her sharp
I would make it whine
Hed say, You cant beat the way a old wood boat rides
Just a little lake across the Alabama line
But I was king of the ocean
When Daddy let me drive
Just an old half ton short bed Ford
My uncle bought new in 64
Daddy got it right cause the engine was smoking
A couple burnt valves and he had it going
Hed let me drive her when we haul off a load
Down a dirt strip, wed haul trash off of Thigpen Road
Id sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedals
Smiling like a hero who just received his medal

It was just an old hand-me-down Ford
With 3 speed on the column and a dent in the door
A young girl, two hands on the wheel
I cant replace the way it made me feel and
I would press that clutch
And I would keep it right
He would say a little slower, girl
Youre doing just fine
Just a dirt road with trash on each side
But I was Mario Andretti
When Daddy let me drive
Soon Ill be grown up
With daughters of my own
I let them drive my old jeep
Across the pasture at our home
Maybe one day theyll reach back in their file
And pull out that old memory
And think of me and smile
And say
It was just an old worn out jeep
Rusty old floor boards
Hot on my feet
A young girl, two hands on the wheel
I cant replace the way it made me feel
And hed say
Steer it left, and turn it right
Straighten up girl now, youre doing just fine
Just a little valley by the river where wed ride
But I was high on a mountain
When Daddy let me drive
Oh, he let me drive
Oh, he let me drive
Its just an old plywood boat
With a 75 johnson
And electric chokeEmbed
To the left, to the left, everything you own in the box to the left
In the closet, thats my stuff, yes, I bought it
Please dont touch
Keep talking and yes, thats fine
Could you walk and talk at the same time?
And its my name thats on the tag
Come in with your bags, let me call you a cab
Standing in the front yard, telling me how Im such a fool
How Im never gonna find a man like you, got me twisted
You must not know about me
You must not know about me
I can have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, hell be here in a minute, baby
You must not know about me
You must not know about me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So dont you, ever for a second, get to thinking
Youre irreplaceable

So, go ahead and get gone
Call up that chick and see if shes home
Oops, I bet you thought that I didnt know
Whatd you think I was putting you out for?
Cause you were untrue, hauling her around in the truck that I bought you
Baby, drop them keys, hurry up before your taxi leaves
Standing in the front yard, telling me how Im such a fool
Talking about, how Im never gonna find a man like you
Got me twisted
You must not know about me
You must not know about me
I can have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, hell be here in a minute, baby
You must not know about me
You must not know about me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So dont you, ever for a second, get to thinking

Ok, here’s the Westerly one, written in Westerly
Im like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never wouldve known from the look on your face
Drown in your current like a priceless wine
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
Im begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, thats my man
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Hеad on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin in
As if you werе a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And it was only one game Id die to win
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
Im begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, thats my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
Begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, thats my man

And then I was thinking like a choral section like ...
Wait for the signal, and Ill meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open-shut case
I guess I shouldve known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
Begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, thats my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
Im begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, thats my man
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
Begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, thats my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
Begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, thats my man
Hey, thats my man
Yeah, thats my man
Yeah, thats my man
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
Thats my man
Hey, thats my man
Im begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, thats my manEmbed
My winter nights are taken up by static
Stress and holiday shopping traffic
But I close my eyes and Im somewhere else
Just like magic
In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
Where the people would come
To dance under sparkling lights
Bundled up in their mittens and coats
And the cider would flow
And I just wanna be there tonight
Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everythin is icy and blue
And you would be there too
Under the mistlеtoe
Watchin the fire glow
And tеllin me, I love you
Just bein in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true

In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
Theres a light in the barn
Wed run inside out from the cold
In the town, kids are dreamin of sleighs
And theyre warm and theyre safe
They wake to see a blanket of snow
Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everythin is icy and blue
And you would be there too
Under the mistletoe
Watchin the fire glow
And tellin me, I love you
Just bein in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true
Baby, yeah
And when Im feelin alone
You remind me of home
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
And when the world isnt fair
I pretend that were there
Baby, baby, Merry Christmas (To you)
Under the mistletoe (To you)
Watching the fire glow
And tellin me, I love you
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas (Darling)
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
I love you
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas (I just want you to know)
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
May your every wish come true

Find myself at your door
Just like all those times before
I’m not sure how I got there
All roads they lead me here
I imagine you are home
In your room, all alone
And you open your eyes into mine
And everything feels better
And right before your eyes
I’m breaking
No fuss, no reasons why
Just you and me
(e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he)
This is the last time I’m asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I’m asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye
(eye, eye)
You find yourself at my door
Just like all those times before
You wear your best apology
But I was there to watch you leave
And all the times I let you in
Just for you to go again
Disappear when you come back
Everything is better

And right before your eyes
I’m aching
No fuss, nowhere to hide
Just you and me
(e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he)
This is the last time I’m asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I’m asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye
(eye, eye)
This is the last time you tell me I’ve got it wrong
This is the last time I say it’s been you all along
This is the last time I let you in my door
This is the last time, I won’t hurt you anymore
Oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho
Oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho
This is the last time I’m asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I’m asking you why

Last time Im asking you this

Where is the video of Kanye telling me he was going to call me ‘that bitch’ in his song? It doesnt exist because it never happened. You dont get to control someone’s emotional response to being called ‘that bitch’ in front of the entire world. Of course I wanted to like the song. I wanted to believe Kanye when he told me that I would love the song. I wanted us to have a friendly relationship. He promised to play the song for me, but he never did. While I wanted to be supportive of Kanye on the phone call, you cannot ‘approve’ a song you haven’t heard. Being falsely painted as a liar when I was never given the full story or played any part of the song is character assassination. I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative, one that I have never asked to be a part of, since 2009.2Embed

Im so sick of running as fast as I can
Wonderin if Id get there quicker if I was a man
And Im so sick of them comin at me again
Cause if I was a man, then Id be the man
Id be the man, Id be the man, yeah
Cause Id be the man, Id be the man
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
Im standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, Hello, little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, stay away from Juliet
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, please dont go, and I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
Ill be waiting, all theres left to do is run
Youll be the prince and Ill be the princess
Its a love story baby, just say, Yes

Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me
I guess you didnt care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me
And hes long gone, when hes next to me
And I realize the blame is on me
Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been
Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been
Now Im lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble
And the saddest fear
Comes creeping in
That you never loved me
Or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been
Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (Knew it right there, knew it right there)
So shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there, and I thought
Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Loves a game, wanna play? Ayy
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Aint it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, lets be friends
Im dyin to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
So its gonna be forever
Or its gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when its over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
Theyll tell you Im insane
Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
Cause were young and were reckless
Well take this way too far
Itll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
Theyll tell you Im insane
But Ive got a blank space, baby
And Ill write your name
Boys only want love if its torture
Dont say I didnt, say I didnt warn ya
Boys only want love if its torture
Dont say I didnt, say I didnt warn ya
I stay out too late
Got nothing in my brain
Thats what people say, mm, mm
Thats what people say, mm, mm
I go on too many dates
But I cant make them stay
At least thats what people say, mm, mm
Thats what people say, mm, mm
But I keep cruisin
Cant stop, wont stop movin
Its like I got this music in my mind
Saying its gonna be alright
Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, Im just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake

Hey, hey, hey

And the dirty, dirty cheats of the world
You couldve been getting down
To this sick beat
My ex-man brought his new girlfriend
Shes like, Oh my God, but Im just gonna shake
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair
Why dont you come on over, baby?

We could leave the Christmas lights up til January
This is our place, we make the rules
And theres a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, and
Ah, take me out, take me home
Youre my, my, my, my lover
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My hearts been borrowed, yours has been blue
Alls well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And youll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, Ill save you a seat, lover
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, and
Take me out, take me home (Forever and ever)
Youre my, my, my, my
Oh, youre my, my, my, my
Oh, darlin, youre my, my, my, my

As for me, Im 90% sure the main rеason Im here is becausе I have a song called 22. And let me just say, I am elated to be here with you today as we celebrate and graduate New York Universitys Class of 2022. Not a single one of us here today has done it alone. We are each a patchwork quilt of those who have loved us, those who have believed in our futures, those who showed us empathy and kindness, or told us the truth, even when it wasnt easy to hear. Those who told us we could do it when there was absolutely no proof of that. Someone read stories to you, and taught you to dream, and offered up some moral code of right and wrong for you to try and live by. Someone tried their best to explain every concept in this insanely complex world to the child that was you as you asked a bazillion questions, like, How does the moon work? and Why can we eat salad, but not grass? And maybe they didnt do it perfectly — no one ever can —, maybe they arent with us anymore, in that case, I hope youll remember them today. If they are in this staium, I hope youll find your own way to express your gratitude for all the steps, and missteps, that have led us to this common destination.
I know that words are supposed to be my thing, but I will never be able to find the words to thank my mom and dad, and my brother, Austin, for the sacrifices they made every day, so I could go from singing in coffeehouses to standing up here with you today, because no words would ever be enough. To all the incredible parents, family members, mentors, teachers, allies, friends, and loved ones here today who have supported these students in their pursuit of educational enrichment, let me say to you now: Welcome to New York, its been waiting for you.
Id like to thank NYU for making me technically, on paper at least, a doctor. Not the type of doctor you would want around in case of an emergency, unless your specific emergency was that you desperately needed to hear a song with a catchy hook and an intensely cathartic bridge section. Or if your emergency was that you needed a person who can name over 50 breeds of cats in one minute. I never got to have a normal college experience, per se. I went to public high school until 10th grade and then finished my education doing homeschool work on the floors of airport terminals. Then, I went on the road for radio tour, which sounds incredibly glamourous, but in reality, it consisted of a rental car, motels, and my mom and I pretending to have loud mother-daughter fights with each other during boarding, so no one would want the empty seat between us on Southwest.
As a kid, I always thought I would go away to college, imagining the posters I would hang on the wall of my freshman dorm. I even set the ending of my music video for my song Love Story at my fantasy, imaginary college, where I meet a male model reading a book on the grass, and with one single glance, we realize we had been in love in our past lives. Which is exactly what you guys all experienced at some point in the last four years, right?
But I really cant complain about not having a normal college experience to you, because you went to NYU during a global pandemic, being essentially locked into your dorms and having to do classes over Zoom. Everyone in college during normal times stresses about test scores, but on top of that, you also had to pass, like, a thousand COVID tests. I imagine the idea of a normal college experience was all you wanted, too, but in this case, you and I both learned that you dont always get all the things in the bag that you selected from the menu in the delivery service that is life. You get what you get. And as I would like to say to you, wholeheartedly, you should be very proud of what youve done with it. Today, you leave New York University and then go out into the world, searching whats next. And so will I.
So, as a rule, I try not to give anyone unsolicited advice, unless they ask for it. Ill go into this more later. I guess I have been officially solicited in this situation to impart whatever wisdom I might have to tell you things that have helped me so far in my life. Please, bear in mind that I, in no way, feel qualified to tell you what to do. Youve worked, and struggled, and sacrificed, and studied, and dreamed your way here today, and so you know what youre doing. Youll do things differently than I did them and for different reasons. So, I wont tell you what to do, cause no one likes that. I will, however, give you some life hacks I wish I knew when I was starting out my dreams of a career and navigating life, love, pressure, choices, shame, hope, and friendship.
The first of which is: Life can be heavy, especially if you try to carry it all at once. Part of growing up and moving into new chapters of your life is about catch and release. What I mean by that is knowing what things to keep and what things to release. You cant carry all things, all grudges, all updates on your ex, all enviable promotions your school bully got at the hedge fund his uncle started. Decide what is yours to hold and let the rest go. Oftentimes, the good things in your life are lighter anyway, so theres more room for them. One toxic relationship can outweigh so many wonderful simple joys. You get to pick what your life has time and room for. Be discerning.
Secondly: Learn to live alongside cringe. No matter how hard you try to avoid being cringe, you will look back on your life and cringe, retrospectively. Cringe is unavoidable over a lifetime, even the term cringe might someday be deemed cringe. I promise you, youre probably doing or wearing something right now that you will look back on later and find revolting and hilarious. You cant avoid it, so dont try to. For example, I had a phase where, for the entirety of 2012, I dressed like a 1950s housewife. But you know what? I was having fun. Trends and phases are fun. Looking back and laughing is fun.
And while were talking about things that make us squirm, but really shouldnt, Id like to say Im a big advocate for not hiding your enthusiasm for things. It seems to me that there is a false stigma around eagerness in our culture of unbothered ambivalence. This outlook perpetuates the idea that its not cool to want it; the people who dont try are fundamentally more chic than people who do. And I wouldnt know, because I am a lot of things, but Ive never been expert on chic, but Im the one whos up here, so you have to listen to me when I say this. Never be ashamed of trying. Effortlessness is a myth. The people who wanted it the least were the ones I wanted to date, and be friends with in high school. The people who want it the most are the people I now hire to work for my company.
I started writing songs when I was 12, and since then, its been the compass guiding my life, and in turn, my life guided my writing. Everything I do is just an extension of my writing, whether its directing videos, or a short film, creating the visuals for a tour, or standing on a stage performing. Everything is connected by my love of the craft, the thrill of working through ideas, narrowing them down, polishing it up in the end, editing, waking up in the middle of the night, throwing out an old idea because you thought of a newer, better one, or a plot device that ties it all together. Theres a reason they call it a hook: Sometimes a string of words just ensnares me and I cant focus on anything until its been recorded or written down.
As a songwriter, Ive never been able to sit still or stay in one place for too long. Ive made and released 11 albums and, in the process, Ive switched genre from country to pop to alternative to folk, and this might sound like a very songwriter centric line of discussion, but in a way, I really do think we are all writers. And most of us write in a different voice for different situations. You write differently in your Instagram stories than you do your senior thesis; you send a different type of email to boss than you do to your best friend from home. We are all literary chameleons and I think its fascinating — its a continuation of the idea that we are many things all the time. And I know it can be very overwhelming figuring out who to be and when, who you are now and how to act in order to get where you want to go.
I have some good news: Its totally up to you. I have some terrifying news: Its totally up to you.
I said to you earlier that I dont ever offer advice unless someone asks for it, and now Ill tell you why. As a person who started my very public career at the age of 15, it came with a price, and that price was years of unsolicited advice. Being the youngest person in every room for over a decade meant that I was constantly being issued warnings from older members of the music industry, media, interviewers, executives. And this advice often presented itself as thinly veiled warnings.
See, I was a teenager at a time when our society was absolutely obsessed with the idea of having perfect young female role models. It felt like every interview I did included slight barbs by the interviewer about me one day running off the rails, and that meant a different thing to every person who said it to me. So, I became a young adult while being fed the message that if I didnt make any mistakes, all the children of America would grow up to be perfect angels. However, if I did slip up, the entire Earth would fall off its axis, and it would be entirely fault, and I would go to pop star jail forever and ever. It was all centered around the idea that mistakes equal failure, and ultimately the loss of any chance at a happy or rewarding life.
This has not been my experience. My experience has been that my mistakes led to the best things in my life, and being embarrassed when you mess up is part of the human experience. Getting back up, dusting yourself off, and seeing who still wants to hang out after and laugh about it — thats a gift. The times I was told no, or wasnt included, wasnt chosen, didnt win, didnt make the cut, looking back, it really feels like those moments were as important, if not more crucial than the moments I was told yes.
Not being invited to the parties and sleepovers in my hometown made me feel hopelessly lonely, but because I felt alone I would sit in my room and write the songs that would get me a ticket somewhere else. Having label executives in Nashville tell me that only 35-year-old housewives listened to Country music and there was no place for a 13-year-old on their roster made me cry in the car on the way home. But then Id post my songs on my MySpace — yes, MySpace — and I would message with other teens like me who loved country music, but just didnt have anyone singing from their perspective.
Having journalists write in-depth, oftentimes critical, pieces about who they perceived me to be made me feel like I was living in some weird simulation, but it also made me look inward to learn about who I actually am. Having the world treat my love life like a spectator sport in which I lose every single game was not a great way to date in my teens and twenties, but it taught me to protect my private life fiercely. Being publicly humiliated over and over again at a young age was excruciatingly painful, but it forced me to devalue the ridiculous notion of minute-by-minute, ever-fluctuating social relevance and likeability. Getting canceled on the internet and nearly losing my career gave me an excellent knowledge of all the types of wine.
I know I sound like a consummate optimist, but Im really not. I lose perspective all the time. Sometimes, everything just feels completely pointless. I know the pressure of living your life through the lens of perfectionism. And I know that Im talking to a group of perfectionists because you are here today graduating from NYU. So this might be hard for you to hear: In your life, you will inevitably misspeak, trust the wrong person, underreact, overreact, hurt the people who didnt deserve it, overthink, not think at all, self-sabotage, create a reality where only your experience exists, ruin perfectly good moments for yourself and others, deny any wrongdoing, not take the steps to make it right, feel very guilty, let the guilt eat at you, hit rock bottom, finally address the pain you caused, try to do better next time, rinse, repeat.
And Im not going to lie, these mistakes will cause you to lose things. Im trying to tell you that losing things doesnt just mean losing. A lot of the time, when we lose things, we gain things too. Now, you leave the structure and framework of school and chart your own path. Every choice you make leads to the next choice, which leads to the next, and I know its hard to know which path to take. There will be times in life when you need to stand up for yourself. Times when the right thing is actually to back down and apologize. Times when the right thing is to fight. Times when the right thing is to turn and run. Times to hold on with all you have, and times to let go with grace. Sometimes the right thing to do is to throw out the old schools of thought in the name of progress and reform. Sometimes the right thing to do is to sit and listen to wisdom to those who have come before us. How will you know what the right choice is in these crucial moments? You wont. How do I give advice to this many people about their life choices? I wont. The scary news is, youre on your own now. But the cool news is, youre on your own now.
I leave you with this: We are led on our gut instincts, our intuition, our desires and fears, our scars, and our dreams. And you will screw it up sometimes. So will I, and when I do, you will most likely read about it on the internet. Anyway, hard things will happen to us, we will recover, we will learn from it, we will grow more resilient because of it, and as long as we are fortunate enough to be breathing, we will breathe in, breathe through, breathe deep, and breathe out. And I am a doctor now, so I know how breathing works. I hope you know how proud I am to share this day with you. Were doing this together, so lets just keep dancing like were the class of 22.2Embed
Please picture me in the trees
I hit my peak at seven
Feet in the swing over the creek
I was too scared to jump in
But I, I was high in the sky
With Pennsylvania under me
Are there still beautiful things?
Sweet tea in the summer
Cross your heart, wont tell no other
And though I cant recall your face
I still got love for you
Your braids make a pattern
Love you to the Moon and to Saturn
Passed down like folk songs
The love lasts so long
And Ive been meaning to tell you
I think your house is haunted
Your dad is always mad and that must be why
And I think you should come live with me
And we can be pirates
Then you wont have to cry
Or hide in the closet
And just like a folk song
Our love will be passed on

Please picture me in the weeds
Before I learned civility
I used to scream ferociously
Any time I wanted
I, I
Sweet tea in the summer
Cross your heart, wont tell no other
And though I cant recall your face
I still got love for you
Pack your dolls and a sweater
Well move to India forever
Passed down like folk songs
The love lasts so longEmbed
You cant start a fire without a spark
This guns for hire
Even if were just dancing in the dark
This guns for hire
Even if were just dancing in the dark
Weve gotta hold on to what weve got
It doesnt make a difference if we make it or not
Weve got each other and thats a lot
For love well give it a shot
Whoa, were half way there
Whoa, livin on a prayer
Take my hand and well make it, I swear
Whoa, livin on a prayer
Livin on a prayerEmbed
I want you to know
Im a mirrorball
Ill show you every version of yourself tonight
Ill get you out on the floor
Shimmering beautiful
And when I break, its in a million pieces
Hush, when no one is around, my dear
Youll find me on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you
Hush, I know they said the end is near
But Im still on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you
I want you to know
Im a mirrorball
I can change everything about me to fit in
You are not like the regulars
The masquerade revelers
Drunk as thеy watch my shattered edgеs glisten

Hush, when no one is around, my dear
Youll find me on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you
Hush, I know they said the end is near
But Im still on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you
And they called off the circus, burned the disco down
When they sent home the horses and the rodeo clowns
Im still on that tightrope
Im still tryin everything to get you laughing at me
And Im still a believer, but I dont know why
Ive never been a natural, all I do is try, try, try
Im still on that trapeze
Im still trying everything to keep you looking at me
Because Im a mirrorball
Im a mirrorball
And Ill show you every version of yourself tonightEmbed
Betty, I wont make assumptions
About why you switched your homeroom, but
I think its cause of me
Betty, one time I was riding on my skateboard
When I passed your house
Its like I couldnt breathe
You heard the rumors from Inez
You cant believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust mе
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
Im only seventeen, I dont know anything
But I know I miss you
Bеtty, I know where it all went wrong
Your favorite song was playing
From the far side of the gym
I was nowhere to be found
I hate the crowds, you know that
Plus, I saw you dance with him

You heard the rumors from Inez
You cant believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
Im only seventeen, I dont know anything
But I know I miss you
I was walking home on broken cobblestones
Just thinking of you when she pulled up like
A figment of my worst intentions
She said James, get in, lets drive
Those days turned into nights
Slept next to her, but
I dreamt of you all summer long
Betty, Im here on your doorstep
And I planned it out for weeks now
But its finally sinkin in
Betty, right now is the last time
I can dream about what happens when
You see my face again
The only thing I wanna do
Is make it up to you
So I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party
Will you have me? Will you love me?
Will you kiss me on the porch
In front of all your stupid friends?
If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?
Will it patch your broken wings?
Im only seventeen, I dont know anything
But I know I miss you
Standing in your cardigan
Kissin in my car again
Stopped at a streetlight
You know I miss youEmbed
I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
Ive ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, Ill watch as youre leaving
Cause you got tirеd of my scheming
(For the last time)
Its mе, hi
Im the problem, its me
At teatime, everybody agrees
Ill stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And Im a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed

Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, Ill watch as youre leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
(For the last time)
Its me, hi
Im the problem, its me
At teatime, everybody agrees
Ill stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers round and reads it and then someone screams out
Shes laughing up at us from Hell
Its me, hi
Im the problem, its me
Its me, hi
Im the problem, its me
Its me, hi
Everybody agrees, everybody agrees
Its me, hi
Im the problem, its me
At teatime, everybody agrees
Ill stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-heroEmbed
Go!
I used to think one day, wed tell the story of us
How we met and the sparks flew instantly
And people would say, Theyre the lucky ones
I used to know my place was a spot next to you
Now, Im searching the room for an empty seat
Lately, I dont even know what page youre on
Oh, a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fallout
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up, I cant break through
Now, Im standing alone in a crowded room
And were not speaking
And Im dying to know
Is it killing you like its killing me? Yeah
I dont know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

Next chapter
Howd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy
And youre doing your best to avoid me
Im starting to think one day, Ill tell the story of us
Of how I was losing my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like you shouldve held me
Oh, Im scared to see the ending
Why are we pretending this is nothing?
Id tell you I miss you, but I dont know how
Ive never heard silence quite this loud
Now, Im standing alone in a crowded room
And were not speaking
And Im dying to know
Is it killing you like its killing me? Yeah
I dont know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
Can I please see you jump?
This is looking like a contest
Of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side
The battles in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down
If you say youd rather love than fight
So many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon
Now, Im standing alone in a crowded room
And were not speaking
And Im dying to know
Is it killing you like its killing me? Yeah
I dont know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now (Now, now, now)
Oh (Now, now, now)
And were not speaking
And Im dying to know
Is it killing you like its killing me? Yeah
I dont know what to say since the twist of fate
Cause were going down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
The end4Embed
Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny
Her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off St. Louis
Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money
And the town said, How did a middle-class divorcée do it?
The wedding was charming, if a little gauche
Theres only so far new money goes
They picked out a home and called it Holiday House
Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud
The doctor had told him to settle down
It must have been her fault his heart gave out
And they said
There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what couldve been
There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything
Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever
Flew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city
Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names
And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet
And losing on card game bets with Dalí

And they said
There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what couldve been
There goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything
They say she was seen on occasion
Pacing the rocks, staring out at the midnight sea
And in a feud with her neighbor
She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green
Fifty years is a long time
Holiday House sat quietly on that beach
Free of women with madness, their men and bad habits
And then it was bought by me
Who knows, if I never showed up, what couldve been
There goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen
I had a marvelous time ruining everything
I had a marvelous time ruining everything
A marvelous time ruining everything
A marvelous time
Ruining everything
A marvelous timeEmbed
No sir
Well, I dont wanna be the blame, not anymore
Its your turn
So take a seat were settling the final score
And why do we like to hurt so much?
I cant decide
You have made it harder just to go on
And why? All the possibilities
Well, I was wrong
Thats what you get when you let your heart win, (woah)
Thats what you get when you let your heart win, (woah)
I drowned out all my sense with the sound of its beating
And thats what you get when you let your heart win, (woah)
I wonder
How am I supposed to feel when youre not here?
Cause I burned every bridge I ever built when you were here
I still try holding onto silly things, I never learn
Oh, why?
All the possibilities
Im sure youve heard

Thats what you get when you let your heart win, (woah)
Thats what you get when you let your heart win, (woah)
I drowned out all my sense with the sound of its beating
And thats what you get when you let your heart win, (woah)
Pain, make your way to me, to me
And Ill always be just so inviting
If I ever start to think straight
This heart will start a riot in me
Lets start, start, hey!
Why do we like to hurt so much?
Oh, why do we like to hurt so much?
Thats what you get when you let your heart win, woah
Thats what you get when you let your heart win, woah
Thats what you get when you let your heart win, woah
Now, I cant trust myself with anything but this
And thats what you get when you let your heart win, woahEmbed
Make sure nobody sees you leave
Hood over your head, keep your eyes down
Tell your friends youre out for a run
Youll be flushed when you return
Take the road less traveled by
Tell yourself you can always stop
What started in beautiful rooms
Ends with meetings in parking lots
And thats the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and longing stares
Its born from just one single glance
But it dies and it dies and it dies
A million little times
Leave the perfume on the shеlf
That you picked out just for him
So you leave no tracе behind
Like you dont even exist
And take the words for what they are
A dwindling, mercurial high
A drug that only worked
The first few hundred times

And thats the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and stolen stares
They show their truth one single time
But they lie and they lie and they lie
A million little times
And you wanna scream
Dont call me kid, dont call me baby
Look at this godforsaken mess that you made me
You showed me colors you know I cant see with anyone else
Dont call me kid, dont call me baby
Look at this idiotic fool that you made me
You taught me a secret language I cant speak with anyone else
And you know damn well
For you, I would ruin myself
A million little timesEmbed

Im so glad you made time to see me
Hows life? Tell me, hows your family?
I havent seen them in a while
Youve been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die
So this is me swallowin my pride
Standin in front of you sayin Im sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom aint nothin but missin you
Wishin Id realized what I had when you were mine
Id go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time
These days, I havent been sleepin
Stayin up playin back myself leavin
When your birthday passed and I didnt call
Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughin from the passengers side
And realized I loved you in the fall
And then the cold came, the dark days
When fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye

So this is me swallowin my pride
Standin in front of you sayin Im sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom aint nothin but missin you
Wishin Id realized what I had when you were mine
Id go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time
I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinkin
Probably mindless dreamin
But if we loved again, I swear Id love you right
Id go back in time and change it, but I cant
So if the chain is on your door, I understand
But this is me swallowin my pride
Standin in front of you sayin Im sorry for that night
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom aint nothin but missin you
Wishin Id realized what I had when you were mine
Id go back to December, turn around and make it alright
Id go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time
All the timeEmbed
One, two, one
My only one
My smoking gun
My eclipsed sun
This has broken me down
My twisted knife
My sleepless night
My winless fight
This has frozen my ground
Stood on the cliffside screaming, Give me a reason
Your faithless loves the only hoax I believe in
Dont want no other shade of blue but you
No other sadness in the world would do
My best laid plan
Your sleight of hand
My barren land
I am ash from your fire
Stood on the cliffside screaming, Give me a reason
Your faithless loves thе only hoax I believe in
Dont want no othеr shade of blue but you
No other sadness in the world would do

You know I left a part of me back in New York
You knew the hero died so whats the movie for?
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart
You knew the password so I let you in the door
You knew you won so whats the point of keeping score?
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart
But what you did was just as dark
Darling, this was just as hard
As when they pulled me apart
My only one
My kingdom come undone
My broken drum
You have beaten my heart
Dont want no other shade of blue but you
No other sadness in the world would doEmbed
Youd be long gone
Id stand up and punch them out
Cause theyre all wrong
I know better, cause you said forever
And ever, who knew?
If someone said three years from now
Youd be long gone
That last kiss, Ill cherish, until we meet again
My darling, who knew?
Because P!nk is from Philly, ladies and gentlemen!
I wish I could tie you up in my shoes
Make you feel unpretty too
I was told I was beautiful
But what does that mean to you?
Look into the mirror, whos inside there
The one with the long hair
Same old me again today, yeah
My outsides look cool
My insides are blue
Every time I think Im through
Its because of you
I try different ways
But its all the same
At the end of the day
I have myself to blame
Im just trippin
You can buy your hair if it wont grow
You can fix your nose if he says so
You can buy all the make-up
They can make, but if
You cant look inside you
Find out who am I to
Be in the position that make me feel
So
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Make you feel unpretty too
Thats another song by an artist from Philly, I wanna see if you know itEmbed
Here you come again
Just when Id begun to get myself together
You waltz right in the door
Just like youve done before
And wrap my heart round your little finger
Here you come again
Just when Im about to make it work without you
You look into my eyes
And lie those pretty lies
And pretty soon Im wondering how I came to doubt you
All you got to do is smile that smile
And there go all my defenses
Just leave it up to you and in a little while
Youre messing up my mind and filling up my senses
Here you come again
Looking better than a body has a right to
And shaking me up so that all I really know
Is here you come again
And here I go

All you got to do is smile that smile
And there go all my defenses
Just leave it up to you and in a little while
Youre messing up my mind and filling up my senses
Here you come again
Looking better than a body has a right to
And shaking me up so
That all I really know
Is here you come again
And here I go
Here I go
And here I go
And here I go
Here you come again
And here I go
Here I go
And here I go
Here I goEmbed

Green was the color of the grass
Where I used to read at Centennial Park
I used to think I would meet somebody there
Teal was the color of your shirt
When you were sixteen at the yogurt shop
You used to work at to make a little money
Time, curious time
Gave me no compasses, gave me no signs
Were there clues I didnt see?
And isnt it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Bad was the blood of the song in the cab
On your first trip to LA
You ate at my favorite spot for dinner
Bold was the waitress on our three-year trip
Getting lunch down by the Lakes
She said I looked like an American singer

Time, mystical time
Cutting me open, then healing me fine
Were there clues I didnt see?
And isnt it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
A string that pulled me
Out of all the wrong arms, right into that dive bar
Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire
Chains around my demons
Wool to brave the seasons
One single thread of gold
Tied me to you
Cold was the steel of my axe to grind
For the boys who broke my heart
Now I send their babies presents
Gold was the color of the leaves
When I showed you around Centennial Park
Hell was the journey but it brought me heaven
Time, wondrous time
Gave me the blues and then purple-pink skies
And its cool
Baby, with me
And isnt it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Me
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah-ah-ah, yeah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, oh noEmbed
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he wont see
That I want and Im needing
Everything that we should be
Ill bet shes beautiful
That girl he talks about
And shes got everything that I have to live without
Drew talks to me
I laugh cause its just so funny
That I cant even see
Anyone when hes with me
He says hes so in love
Hes finally got it right
I wonder if he knows hes all I think about at night
Hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
Hes the song in the car I keep singing
Dont know why I do

Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I cant breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be
Shed better hold him tight
Give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know shes lucky cause
Hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
Hes the song in the car I keep singing
Dont know why I do
So I drive home alone
As I turn off the light
Ill put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight
Cause hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who’s got enough for me to break my heart
Hes the song in the car I keep singing
Dont know why I do
Hes the time taken up, but theres never enough
And hes all that I need to fall into
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he wont seeEmbed
Our coming-of-age has come and gone
Suddenly this summer, its clear
I never had the courage of my convictions
As long as danger is near
And its just around the corner, darlin
Cause it lives in me
No, I could never give you peace
But Im a fire and Ill keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade, ocean wave blues come
All these people think loves for show
But I would die for you in secret
The devils in the details, but you got a friеnd in me
Would it be enough if I could nеver give you peace?
Your integrity makes me seem small
You paint dreamscapes on the wall
I talk shit with my friends, its like Im wasting your honor
And you know that Id swing with you for the fences
Sit with you in the trenches
Give you my wild, give you a child
Give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other
Family that I chose, now that I see your brother as my brother
Is it enough?
Cause theres robbers to the east, clowns to the west
Id give you my sunshine, give you my best
But the rain is always gonna come if youre standin with me

But Im a fire and Ill keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade, ocean wave blues come
All these people think loves for show
And I would die for you in secret
The devils in the details, but you got a friend in me
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?Embed
Im highly biased, but I think that the way music can transport you back to a long-forgotten memory is the closest sensation we have to traveling in time. To this day, when I hear Cowboy Take Me Away by the Dixie Chicks, I instantly recall the feeling of being twelve years old, sitting in a little wood paneled room in my family home in Pennsylvania. Im clutching a guitar and learning to play the chords and sing the words at the same time, rehearsing for a gig at a coffee house. When I hear I Write Sins Not Tragedies by Panic! At The Disco, I’m transported back to being sixteen and driving down the streets of Hendersonville, Tennessee, with my best friend Abigail, euphorically screaming the lyrics. When I hear How to Save a Life by The Fray, Breathe (2AM) by Anna Nalick, or The Story by Brandi Carlile, I immediately flashback to being seventeen and on tour for months on end. When Id get a day at home in between long stretches on the road sharing a van with my band and crew, I would spend my rare nights off painting alone with candles lit in my room – just being alone with those songs (Those are all from the Greys Anatomy soundtrack. My commitment to that show truly knows no bounds). Im convinced that You Learn by Alanis Morissette, Put Your Records On by Corinne Bailey Rae and Why by Annie Lennox have actually healed my heart after bad breakups or let downs.
I love writing songs because I love preserving memories, like putting a picture frame around a feeling you once had. I like to use nostalgia as inspiration when Im writing songs for the same reason I like to take photographs. I like to be able to remember the extremely good and extremely bad times. I want to remember the color of the sweater, the temperature of the air, the creak of the floorboards, the time on the clock when your heart was stolen or shattered or healed or claimed forever.
The fun challenge of writing a pop song is squeezing those evocative details into the catchiest melodic cadence you can possibly think of. I thrive on the challenge of sprinkling personal mementos and shreds of reality into a genre of music that is universally known for being, well, universal. Youd think that as pop writers, were supposed to be writing songs that everyone can sing along to, so youd assume they would have to be pretty lyrically generic… AND YET the ones I think cut through the most are actually the most detailed, and I don’t mean in a Shakespearean sonnet type of way, although I love Shakespeare as much as the next girl. Obviously. (See Love Story, 2009).
In modern pop, songs/bops/chunes including extremely personal details like Kiki, do you love me and Baby pull me closer in the backseat of your rover have been breaking through on the most global cultural level. This year on tour, I got to hear stadium crowds passionately sing along to a young woman from Cuba singing about Havana.
I think these days, people are reaching out for connection and comfort in the music they listen to. We like being confided in and hearing someone say, this is what I went through as proof to us that we can get through our own struggles. We actually do NOT want our pop music to be generic. I think a lot of music lovers want some biographical glimpse into the world of our narrator, a hole in the emotional walls people put up around themselves to survive. This glimpse into the artist’s story invites us to connect it to our own, and in the best case scenario, allows us the ability to assign that song to our memories. Its this alliance between a song and our memories of the times it helped us heal, or made us cry, dance, or escape that truly stands the test of time. Just like a great book.Embed
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own
I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemys eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
“Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!”
One minute I held the keys
Next the doors were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt, pillars of sand
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I cant explain
Once you go there was never
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldnt believe what Id become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever wanna be king?
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I cant explain
I know Saint Peter wont call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
For some reason I cant explain
I know Saint Peter wont call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the worldEmbed
All this time, time, time...
All this time, time, time...
All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around
Ive been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down
And its taken me this long, baby, but Ive figured you out
And youre thinking well be fine again but not this time around
You dont have to call anymore
I wont pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Dont wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that youre sorry
But I dont believe you, baby, like I did before
Youre not sorry (No no no no)
Youre looking so innocent
I might believe you if I didnt know
Couldve loved you all my life if you hadnt left me waiting in the cold
And youve got your share of secrets
And Im tired of being last to know
And now youre asking me to listen cause its worked each time before but

You dont have to call anymore
I wont pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Dont wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that youre sorry
But I dont believe you, baby, like I did before
Youre not sorry (No no no no)
Youre not sorry (No no no no)
You had me crawling for you, honey, and it never wouldve gone away, no
You used to shine so bright but I watched all of it fade so
So you dont have to call anymore
I wont pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Theres nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that youre sorry
But I dont believe you, baby, like I did before
Youre not sorry (No no no no)
Youre not sorry (No no no no)
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
Woah, oh, oh oh, oh oh oh

The anti-hero
The anti-hero
The anti-hero
The anti-hero
I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
Ive ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, Ill watch as youre leaving
Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)
Its me, hi
Im the problem, its me
At teatime, everybody agrees
Ill stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

(Its me, hi, its me, hi) The anti-hero
(Its me, hi, its me, hi) The anti-hero
(Its me, hi, its me, hi) The anti-hero
(Its me, hi, its me, hi) The anti-hero
(Its me, hi, its me, hi) The anti-hero
(Its me, hi, its me, hi) The anti-hero
(Its me, hi, its me, hi) The anti-hero
(Its me, hi, its me, hi) The anti-hero
Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And Im a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?
(A tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, Ill watch as youre leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
(For the last time)
Its me, hi
Im the problem, its me (Im the problem, its me)
At teatime, everybody agrees
Ill stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
(Its me, hi, its me, hi) The anti-hero
(Its me, hi, its me, hi) Rooting for the anti-hero
(Its me, hi, its me, hi) The anti-hero
(Its me, hi, its me, hi) The anti-hero

I promise that youll never find another like me
I know that Im a handful, baby, uh
I know I never think before I jump
And youre the kind of guy the ladies want
(And theres a lot of cool chicks out there)
I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And troubles gonna follow where I go
(And theres a lot of cool chicks out there)
But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that youll never find another like

And when we had that fight out in the rain
You ran after me and called my name
I never wanna see you walk away
(And theres a lot of lame guys out there)
Cause one of these things is not like the others
Livin in winter, I am your summer
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that youll never find another like

Let me keep you company
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

I don’t think you should wait, you speak now
Drop everything now
The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
And Im a house of cards
Youre the kind of reckless
That should send me running
But I kinda know that I wont get far
And you stood there in front of me
Just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldnt see
What I was thinking of
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something thatll haunt me when youre not around
I see sparks fly whenever you smile
My mind forgets to remind me
Youre a bad idea
You touch me once and its really something
You find Im even better than you imagined I would be
Im on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you I know its no good
Well I could wait patiently but I really wish you would

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something thatll haunt me when youre not around
I see sparks fly whenever you smile
I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me, its just wrong enough to make it feel right
And lead me up the staircase
Wont you whisper soft and slow?
Im captivated by you, baby, like a firework show
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Drop everything now
Take away (take away) the pain
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Drop everything now
(Take away, take away the pain)
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something thatll haunt me when youre not around
I see sparks fly whenever you smile

What did you think Id say to that?
Does a scorpion sting when fighting back?
They strike to kill, and you know I will
You know I will
What do you sing on your drive home?
Do you see my face in the neighbors lawn?
Does she smile
Or does she mouth Fuck you forever?
Every time you call me crazy, I get more crazy
What about that?
And when you say I seem angry, I get more angry
And theres nothing like a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
No one likes a mad woman
You made her like that
And youll poke that bear til her claws come out
And you find something to wrap your noose around
And theres nothing like a mad woman
Now I breathe flames each time I talk
My cannons all firin at your yacht
They say move on, but you know I wont
And women like hunting witches too
Doing your dirtiest work for you
Its obvious that wanting me dead
Has really brought you two together

Every time you call me crazy, I get more crazy
What about that?
And when you say I seem angry, I get more angry
And theres nothing like a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
No one likes a mad woman
You made her like that
And youll poke that bear til her claws come out
And you find something to wrap your noose around
And theres nothing like a mad woman
Im taking my time, taking my time
Cause you took everything from me
Watching you climb, watching you climb
Over people like me
The master of spin has a couple side flings
Good wives always know
She should be mad, should be scathing like me, but
No one likes a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
You made her like thatEmbed
Keep your helmet, keep your life, son
Just a flesh wound, heres your rifle
Crawling up the beaches now
Sir, I think hes bleeding out
And some things you just cant speak about
With you I serve, with you I fall down, down
Watch you breathe in, watch you breathing out, out
Something med school did not cover
Someones daughter, someones mother
Holds your hand through plastic now
Doc, I think shes crashing out
And some things you just cant speak about
Only twenty minutes to sleep
But you dream of some epiphany
Just one single glimpse of relief
To make some sеnse of what youve seen
With you I servе, with you I fall down, down
Watch you breathe in, watch you breathing out, out
With you I serve, with you I fall down, down
Watch you breathe in, watch you breathing out, out

Only twenty minutes to sleep
But you dream of some epiphany
Just one single glimpse of relief
To make some sense of what youve seen
Make sense of what youve seenEmbed
We could leave the Christmas lights up til January
This is our place, we make the rules
And theres a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, take me home
Youre my, my, my, my lover
We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And Im highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
Ive loved you three summers now, honey, but I want em all
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, take me home (Forever and ever)
Youre my, my, my, my lover

Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My hearts been borrowed and yours has been blue
Alls well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And youll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, Ill save you a seat, lover
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
Youre my, my, my, my
Oh, youre my, my, my, my
Darling, youre my, my, my, my loverEmbed
Should have been different but
It wasnt different, was it
Same old story, dear john
And so long
Should have fit like a glove
Should have fit like a ring
Like a diamond ring
A token of true love
Should have all worked out
But it didnt
She should be here now
But she isnt
Theres your trouble
Theres your trouble
You keep seeing double
With the wrong one
You cant see I love you
You cant see she doesnt
But you just keep holding on
Theres your trouble
So now youre thinking bout
All youre missing how
Deep youre sinking
Round and round and dragging down
Why dont you cash in your chips
Why dont you call it a loss
Not such a big loss
Chalk it up better luck
Could have been true love
But it wasnt
It should all add up
But it doesnt

Theres your trouble
Theres your trouble
You keep seeing double
With the wrong one
You cant see I love you
You cant see she doesnt
But you just keep holding on
Theres your trouble
Should have all worked out
But it didnt
She should be here now
But she isnt
Theres your trouble
Theres your trouble
You keep seeing double
With the wrong one
You cant see I love you
You cant see she doesnt

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sisters house
And youve still got it in your drawer, even now
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
Were singin in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know its long gone and
That magics not here no more
And I might be okay, but Im not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh
Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red cause you were lookin over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mothers tellin stories bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me bout your past, thinkin your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, Fuck the patriarchy
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin town
And I was thinkin on the drive down, Any time now
Hes gonna say its love, you never called it what it was
Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin its the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

And I know its long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to
Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
Were dancin round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and wed swear
To remember it all too well, yeah
Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece til you tore it all up
Runnin scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein honest
Im a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin here
Cause I remember it all, all, all
They say alls well that ends well, but Im in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it wouldve been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin in a party bathroom
Some actress askin me what happened, you
Thats what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin coffee like youre on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin you to come
And he said, Its supposed to be fun turning twenty-one
Time wont fly, its like Im paralyzed by it
Id like to be my old self again, but Im still tryin to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You cant get rid of it
Cause you remember it all too well, yeah
Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing youve ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
And I was never good at tellin jokes, but the punch line goes
Ill get older, but your lovers stay my age
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
Im a soldier whos returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
Cause in this citys barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well
Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it (All too well)
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember itEmbed

Never wanna see you walk away

You were in college working part time waitin tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
Wonderin why we bother with love if it never lasts
I say, Can you believe it?
As were lyin on the couch
The moment I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now
Do you remember, we were sittin there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
You are the best thing thats ever been mine
Flash forward and were takin on the world together
And theres a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why Im guarded
You say well never make my parents mistakes

But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about
Do you remember, we were sittin there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
You are the best thing thats ever been mine
Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
You are the best thing thats ever been mine
Oh-oh, oh-oh
And I remember that fight, 2:30AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
Cause thats all Ive ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said, Ill never leave you alone
You said, I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, its like the first time
I fell in love with a careless mans careful daughter
She is the best thing thats ever been mine
Hold on, make it last
Hold on, never turn back
(Hold on) You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter (Make it last)
(Hold on) You are the best thing thats ever been mine (Hold on)
Yes, yes, do you believe it? (Hold on)
Yes, yes, were gonna make it now (Hold on)
Yes, yes, I can see it
Yes, yes, I can see it nowEmbed
The song Bejeweled is a song that I think is really about finding confidence when you feel that its been taken away, for whatever reason. You know, youre feeling insecure, youre feeling taken for granted. One of the things we love to do at night is we love to go dancing, we love to put on an outfit that makes us feel good, and we love to feel like were still bejeweled. And I think that there are tiny inflections of me, hyping myself up to return to pop music after spending these glorious years writing folk songs and being in this metaphorical forest that Ive created. Which Ive loved so much but there, there was like a bit of pumping myself back up to be like, You can do it, youre still bejeweled, like, Im still bejeweled, question mark? Um, well see, but thats what the songs about.Embed
The buttons of my coat were tangled in my hair
In doctors office lighting, I didnt tell you I was scared
That was the first time we were there
Holy orange bottles, each night, I pray to you
Desperate people find faith, so now I pray to Jesus too
And I say to you...
Ooh-ah
Soon, youll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, youll get better
Ooh-ah
Youll get better soon
Cause you have to
I know delusion when I see it in the mirror
You like the nicer nurses, you make the best of a bad deal
I just pretend it isnt real
Ill paint the kitchen neon, Ill brighten up the sky
I know Ill never get it, theres not a day that I wont try
And I say to you...
Ooh-ah
Soon, youll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, youll get better
Ooh-ah
Youll get better soon
Cause you have to

And I hate to make this all about me
But who am I supposed to talk to?
What am I supposed to do
If theres no you?
This wont go back to normal, if it ever was
Its been years of hoping, and I keep saying it because
Cause I have to
Ooh
Youll get better
Ooh
Youll get better
Ooh-ah
Youll get better soon
Cause you have to1Embed
The story of Anti-Hero is that it really encapsulates this album and sort of the darkest corners of your mind when you cant sleep. Playing out a dismal version of your very dark future, um, being afraid of what everyone thinks about you. Really exploring your own self-loathing and kind of having a shocking, scary self-awareness about your flaws as a human being, you know? Anxiety, its, uh, its all throughout this song.Embed
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
But I never thought Id live to see it break
Its getting dark and its all too quiet
And I cant trust anything now
And its coming over you like its all a big mistake
Woah, holding my breath
Wont lose you again
Somethings made your eyes go cold
Come on, come on, dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Somethings gone terribly wrong
Youre all I wanted
Come on, come on, dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Cant breathe whenevеr youre gone
Cant turn back now, Im haunted
Stood thеre and watched you walk away (Walk away)
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time, Im wishing he was you instead

Oh-woah, holding my breath
Wont see you again
Something keeps me holding onto nothing
Come on, come on, dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Somethings gone terribly wrong
Youre all I wanted
Come on, come on, dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Cant breathe whenever youre gone
Cant turn back now, Im haunted
I know, I know
I just know
Youre not gone
You cant be gone, no
Come on, come on, dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Somethings gone terribly wrong
Wont finish what you started
Come on, come on, dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Cant breathe whenever youre gone
I cant go back, Im haunted
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Never ever thought Id see it break
Never thought Id see itEmbed
It wasn’t just like a movie
The rain didn’t soak through my clothes, down to my skin
Im driving away and I, I guess you could say
This is the last time Ill drive this way again
Theres nothing to say and I try to grab at the fray
Cause I, I still love you but I can’t
Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye baby
I want you bad but it’s come down to nothing
And all you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me, yeah
The picture frame is empty
It’s black and white, you’re smiling down at me
I take your photo off the dash
And back to the conversation, we’re so sure of everything
Everything we thought we’d always have
Im lost in the sound of it
The here and the now comes in
Seems like I’m becoming
Part of your past

Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye baby
I want you bad but it’s come down to nothing
All you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me
And there’s so much that I can’t touch
You’re all I want but it’s not enough this time
And I can feel you like you’re slipping through my hands
And I’m so scared of how this ends
Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye baby
I want you bad but it’s come down to nothing
All you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me
Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye baby
I want you bad but it’s comin down to nothing
And all you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me, yeah
There was one thing
I knew would never leave me
It wasn’t just like a movie
The rain didn’t soak through my clothes
Down to my skinEmbed

(You good to go?)
All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know somethin now
Know somethin now I didnt before
And all Ive seen since 18 hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind, makin me feel like
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you
Cause all I know is we said, Hello
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
Youll be mine and Ill be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

And all my walls stood tall, painted blue
Well Ill take em down, take em down
And open up the door for you
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
The beautiful kind, makin up for lost time
Takin flight, makin me feel right-like
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you
Cause all I know is we said, Hello
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
And everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
Youll be mine and Ill be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed
Come back and tell me why
Im feeling like Ive missed you all this time
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that its not all in my mind
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you
Cause all I know is we said, Hello
And your eyes look like coming home

So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain
And everything has changed
All I know is a new found grace
All my days, Ill know your face

He said, Lets get out of this town
Drive out of this city, away from the crowds
I thought, Heaven cant help me now
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down
Hes so tall and handsome as hell
Hes so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is
Say youll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say youll see me again
Even if its just in your
Wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa
Wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa
In your Wildest dreams
Wildest dreams, ah-aah
I said, No one has to know what we do
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gettin good now

Hes so tall and handsome as hell
Hes so bad, but he does it so well
And when weve had our very last kiss
My last request, it is
Say youll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say youll see me again
Even if its just in your
Wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa (Ah-aah, haa)
Wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa
In your Wildest dreams
Wildest dreams, ah-aahEmbed
Combat, Im ready for combat
I say I dont want that, but what if I do?
Cause cruelty wins in the movies
Ive got a hundred thrown-out speeches I almost said to you
Easy they come, easy they go
I jump from the train, I ride off alone
I never grew up, its getting so old
Help me hold on to you
Ive been the archer
Ive been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?
Dark side, I search for your dark side
But what if Im alright, right, right, right here?
And I cut off my nose just to spite my face
Then I hate my reflection for years and years
I wake in the night, I pace like a ghost
The room is on fire, invisible smoke
And all of my heroes die all alone
Help me hold on to you

Ive been the archer
Ive been the prey
Screaming, who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?
(I see right through me, I see right through me)
Cause they see right through me
They see right through me
They see right through
Can you see right through me?
They see right through
They see right through me
I see right through me
I see right through me
All the kings horses, all the kings men
Couldnt put me together again
Cause all of my enemies started out friends
Help me hold on to you
Ive been the archer
Ive been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?
(I see right through me, I see right through me)
But who could stay?
Who could stay?
Who could stay?
Who could stay?
Who could stay?
You could stay

I wanna thank the BRITs, or anyone who decided that I would be worthy of this incredible honor. Im really really proud to be a part of this musical community, especially in a year where we all needed music so much, but what we needed even more was the help and support we got from the NHS and the key workers who are here tonight. Thank you for everything that youve done for us.
This is a really cool one, I love this! I am so indebted to and grateful for my British fans, I love you so much for everything youve done for me. Weve had so many amazing memories inn the last 15 years, from playing Shepherds Bush Empire, to playing the O2 Arena, to playing Wembley Stadium, and hey, because of you, last year I almost played Glastonbury so. But, we all know what happened next, the world changed and I ended up putting out three albums instead.
Making folklore and evermore was one of the most unique, cathartic, extraordinary experiences Ive ever had. I would love the opportunity to thank the amazing creative people that I made those albums with. Thank you Aaron Dessner, thank you Jack Antonoff, Joe, Justin Vernon, The National, Marcus Mumford, Jon Low, Serban Ghenea, Laura Sisk, and HAIM. I wanna thank my friends and family, who know exactly who they are, whose opinion of me never changed whether my stock was up or down, if theres one thing that Ive learned its that you have to look around you everyday and take note of the people who have always believed in you, and never stop appreciating them for it, never take them for granted.
There are so many incredible new artists in this room tonight, and a lot of people watching who have goals and ambitions and dreams for themselves. I need you to hear me when I say there is no career path that comes free of negativity. If youre being met with resistance, that probably means that youre doing something new. If youre experiencing turbulence or pressure, that probably means youre rising. And there might be times when you put your whole heart and soul into something and it is met with cynicism or skepticism. You cannot let that crush you, you have to let it fuel you, because we live in a world where anyone has the right to say anything that they want about you at anytime. But just please remember that you have the right to prove them wrong.
I love you all thank you so much for this beautiful honor, thank you to the BRITs! This is amazing.Embed
So, one of the themes about Midnights is how youre feeling in the middle of the night, and that can be intense self-hatred, intense self-love; you go through these very polarizing emotions when youre up late at night and your brain just spirals. It can spiral downward and it can spiral way up, and you can be really feeling yourself, and Karma is written from a perspective of feeling really happy, really proud of the way your life is, feeling like this must be a reward for going stuff right. Its a song that I really love because I think wе all need some of those moments, you know, wе cant just be beating ourselves up all the time. You have to have these moments where youre like, You know what? Karma is my boyfriend, and thats it.1Embed
She said, I was seven and you were nine
I looked at you like the stars that shined
In the sky‚ the pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
Growing up and falling in love and our mamas smiled
And rolled their eyes and said oh my my my
Take me back to the house in the backyard tree
Said youd beat me up‚ you were bigger than me
You never did‚ you never did
Take me back when our world was one block wide
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
Just two kids, you and I
Oh my my my my
Well, I was sixteen when suddenly
I wasnt that little girl you used to see
But your eyes still shined like pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
They never believed wed really fall in love
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
And said oh my my my

Take me back to the creek beds we turned up
Two A.M. riding in your truck and all I need is you next to me
Take me back to the time we had our very first fight
The slamming of doors instead of kissing goodnight
You stayed outside till the morning light
Oh my my my my
A few years had gone and come around
We were sitting at our favorite spot in town
And you looked at me‚ got down on one knee
Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
Our whole town came and our mamas cried
You said I do and I did too
Take me home where we met so many years before
Well rock our babies on that very front porch
After all this time, you and I
And Ill be eighty-seven; youll be eighty-nine
Ill still look at you like the stars that shine
In the sky, oh my my my
Thank you so much!Embed

You are somebody that I dont know
But youre takin shots at me like its Patrón
And Im just like, damn, its 7 AM
Say it in the street, thats a knock-out
But you say it in a Tweet, thats a cop-out
And Im just like, Hey, are you okay?
And I aint tryna mess with your self-expression
But Ive learned a lesson that stressin and obsessin bout somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down
Youre being too loud
And Im just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop
Like can you just not step on my gown?
You need to calm down
You are somebody that we dont know
But youre comin at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD)
Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Makin that sign mustve taken all night

You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
Cause shade never made anybody less gay
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down
Youre being too loud
And Im just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop
Like can you just not step on his gown?
You need to calm down
And we see you over there on the internet
Comparin all the girls who are killing it
But we figured you out
We all know now we all got crowns
You need to calm down
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down
Youre being too loud (Youre being too loud)
And Im just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop
Like can you just not step on our gowns?
You need to calm down
You need to just stop
Like can you just not step on our gowns?

Its me, hi
Its me, hi
I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
Ive ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, Ill watch as youre leaving
Cause you got tirеd of my scheming
Its me, hi
Im the problеm, its me
At teatime, everybody agrees
Ill stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
Its me, hi
Its me, hi

Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And Im a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, Ill watch as youre leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
Its me, hi
Im the problem, its me
At teatime, everybody agrees
Ill stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

Mastermind is a song that I put last on the album because Im really proud of it, and I love that, when we were making this song, we wanted the verse to sound like romance and this sort of heroes type of soundtrack, and then we wanted the chorus to sound like a villain has just entered the room and the idea that youre flipping this narrative, and you have been planning and plotting things and making them look like an accident — and I think thats sort of an inside joke between me and my fans, that I tend to do that. And so, this song is thе romantic version of that.Embed

He says he doesnt believe anything much he hears these days
He says, Why fall in love, just so you can watch it go away?
He spends most of his nights wishing it was how it used to be
He spends most of his flights getting pulled down by gravity
I call, just checking up on him
Hes up, 3AM, pacing
He says, Its not just a phase Im in
My voice comes out begging
All this time, I didnt know
You were breaking down
Id fall to pieces on the floor
If you werent around
Too young to know it gets better
Ill be summer sun for you forevеr
Forever winter if you go, oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Hе seems fine most of the time
Forcing smiles and never minds
His laugh is a symphony
When the lights go out, its hard to breathe
I pull at every thread trying to solve the puzzles in his head
Live my life scared to death, hell decide to leave instead

I call, just checking up on him
Hes up, 5AM, wasted
Long gone, not even listening
My voice comes out screaming
All this time, I didnt know
You were breaking down
Id fall to pieces on the floor
If you werent around
Too young to know it gets better
Ill be summer sun for you forever
Forever winter if you go, oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
If I was standing there in your apartment
Id take that bomb in your head and disarm it
Id say I love you even at your darkest and
Please dont go, woah-oh-oh
I didnt know
You were breaking down
Id fall to pieces on the floor
If you weren’t around
Too young to know it gets better
Ill be summer sun for you forever
Forever winter if you go
Woah-oh-oh
Ill be your summer sun forever
At 3 AM, pacing
All this time I didnt know
At 5 AM, wasted
Id be in pieces on the floor
Forever winter if you go, oh-oh-oh
He says he doesnt believe anything much he hears these days
He says, Why fall in love
I say, cause I wont go awayEmbed
State the obvious, I didnt get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that Im obsessive and crazy
Thats fine, you wont mind if I say
By the way
I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
Youre a redneck heartbreak whos really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as Im concerned, youre just another picture to burn
Therеs no time for tears
Im just sitting herе planning my revenge
Theres nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddys gonna show you how sorry youll be
Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
Youre a redneck heartbreak whos really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as Im concerned, youre just another picture to burn

And if youre missing me, youd better keep it to yourself
Cause coming back around here would be bad for your health
Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
Youre a redneck heartbreak whos really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
In case you havent heard
I really really hate that
Stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
Youre a redneck heartbreak, whos really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as Im concerned, youre just another picture to burn
Burn, burn, burn, baby, burn
Youre just another picture to burn
Baby, burnEmbed

You were in college, working part-time, waiting tables
Left a small town and never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts
I say, Can you believe it?
As were lying on the couch
The moment, I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now
Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
You are the best thing thats ever been mine
Flash forward, and were taking on the world together
And theres a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why Im guarded
You say well never make my parents mistakes
But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes
This is what I thought about:

Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
You are the best thing thats ever been mine
Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
You are the best thing thats ever been mine oh-woah
And I remember that fight, 2:30 AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out, crying, and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
Cause thats all Ive ever known
Then, you took me by surprise
You said, Ill never leave you alone.
You said, I remember how we felt, sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, its like the first time
I fell in love with a careless mans careful daughter
She is the best thing thats ever been mine
Hold on, make it last
Hold on, never turn back
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
You are the best thing thats ever been mine
Do you believe it?
Were gonna make it now
And I can see it
Yeah, yeah
I can see it now (See it now, see it now)Embed
The moon was as full as a hot cup of coffee
The air was sticky sweet

I’m sure you are aware that Apple Music will be offering a free 3 month trial to anyone who signs up for the service. I’m not sure you know that Apple Music will not be paying writers, producers, or artists for those three months. I find it to be shocking, disappointing, and completely unlike this historically progressive and generous company.
This is not about me. Thankfully I am on my fifth album and can support myself, my band, crew, and entire management team by playing live shows. This is about the new artist or band that has just released their first single and will not be paid for its success. This is about the young songwriter who just got his or her first cut and thought that the royalties from that would get them out of debt. This is about the producer who works tirelessly to innovate and create, just like the innovators and creators at Apple are pioneering in their field…but will not get paid for a quarter of a year’s worth of plays on his or her songs.
These are not the complaints of a spoiled, petulant child. These are the echoed sentiments of every artist, writer and producer in my social circles who are afraid to speak up publicly because we admire and respect Apple so much. We simply do not respect this particular call.
I realize that Apple is working towards a goal of paid streaming. I think that is beautiful progress. We know how astronomically successful Apple has been and we know that this incredible company has the money to pay artists, writers and producers for the 3 month trial period… even if it is free for the fans trying it out.
Three months is a long time to go unpaid, and it is unfair to ask anyone to work for nothing. I say this with love, reverence, and admiration for everything else Apple has done. I hope that soon I can join them in the progression towards a streaming model that seems fair to those who create this music. I think this could be the platform that gets it right.
But I say to Apple with all due respect, it’s not too late to change this policy and change the minds of those in the music industry who will be deeply and gravely affected by this. We don’t ask you for free iPhones. Please don’t ask us to provide you with our music for no compensation.

The color of your eyes I stare into, oh baby blueEmbed
You, with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feeling like Im nothing
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
Calling me out when Im wounded
You, picking on the weaker man
You can take me down
With just one single blow
But you dont know what you dont know
Someday, Ill be living in a big old city
And all youre ever gonna be is mean
Someday, Ill be big enough so you cant hit me
And all youre ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
You, with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I dont already see them
I walk with my head down, trying to block you out
Cause Ill never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again

I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right now
Cause you cant lead me down that road
And you dont know what you dont know
Someday, Ill be living in a big old city
And all youre ever gonna be is mean
Someday, Ill be big enough so you cant hit me
And all youre ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
And I can see you years from now in a bar
Talking over a football game
With that same big loud opinion
But nobodys listening
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
Drunk and grumbling on about how I cant sing
All you are is mean
All you are is mean
And a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life
And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean
But someday, Ill be living in a big old city
And all youre ever gonna be is mean, yeah
Someday, Ill be big enough so you cant hit me
And all youre ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so?
Someday, Ill be living in a big old city
(Why you gotta be so?)
And all youre ever gonna be is mean
(Why you gotta be so?)
Someday, Ill be big enough so you cant hit me
(Why you gotta be so?)
And all youre ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?4Embed
And give her your heart, your heart
As well as your body
And can you lie next to her
And confess your love, your love
As well as your folly
And can you kneel before the king
And say Im clean, Im clean
Tell me now, where was my fault
In loving you with my whole heart
Oh tell me now, where was my fault
In loving you with my whole heart
A white blank page and a swelling rage, rage
You did not think when you sent me to the brink, to the brink
You dеsired my attention but deniеd my affections, my affections
Tell me now, where was my fault
In loving you with my whole heart
Oh tell me now, where was my fault
In loving you with my whole heart
Lead me to the truth and I will follow you with my whole life
Lead me to the truth and I will follow you with my whole lifeEmbed
There was a time I was on your side, but not anymore
Loves like a cannonballEmbed
Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers silence makes me want to take the stairs
If you were here, wed laugh about their vacant stares
But right now, my time is theirs
Seems like theres always someone who disapproves
Theyll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jurys out, but my choice is you
So dont you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the waters rough
But this love is ours
You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I dont care, cause right now, youre mine
And youll say
Dont you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the waters rough
But this love is ours

And its not theirs to speculate if its wrong
And your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong
And Ill fight their doubt and give you faith
With this song for you
Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos
Will be ignored
Cause my heart is yours
So dont you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
So Dont you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
But they cant take whats ours
They cant take whats ours
The stakes are high, the waters rough
But this love is oursEmbed

My winter nights are taken up by static
Stress and holiday shopping traffic
But I close my eyes and Im somewhere else
Just like magic
In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
Where the people would come
To dance under sparkling lights
Bundled up in their mittens and coats
And the cider would flow
And I just wanna be there tonight
Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everythin’ is icy and blue
And you would be there too
Under the mistletoe
Watchin the fire glow
And tellin me, I love you
Just bein in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true

In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
Theres a light in the barn
We run inside out from the cold
In the town, kids are dreamin of sleighs
And theyre warm and theyre safe
They wake to see a blanket of snow
Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everythin’ is icy and blue
And you would be there too
Under the mistletoe
Watchin’ the fire glow
And tellin me, I love you
Just bein’ in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true
Baby, yeah
And when Im feelin alone
You remind me of home
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
And when the world isnt fair
I pretend that we’re there
Baby, baby, Merry Christmas (To you)
Under the mistletoe (To you)
Watching the fire glow
And tellin me, I love you
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas (Darling)
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
I love you
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas (I just want you to know)

I cannot vote for someone who will not be willing to fight for dignity for ALL Americans, no matter their skin color, gender or who they love. Running for Senate in the state of Tennessee is a woman named Marsha Blackburn. As much as I have in the past and would like to continue voting for women in office, I cannot support Marsha Blackburn. Her voting record in Congress appalls and terrifies me. She voted against equal pay for women. She voted against the Reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which attempts to protect women from domestic violence, stalking, and date rape. She believes businesses have a right to refuse service to gay couples. She also believes they should not have the right to marry. These are not MY Tennessee values. I will be voting for Phil Bredesen for Senate and Jim Cooper for House of Representatives. Please, please educate yourself on the candidates running in your state and vote based on who most closely represents your values. For a lot of us, we may never find a candidate or party with whom we agree 100% on every issue, but we have to vote anyway.
So many intelligent, thoughtful, self-possessed people have turned 18 in the past two years and now have the right and privilege to make their vote count. But first you need to register, which is quick and easy to do. October 9th is the LAST DAY to register to vote in the state of TN. Go to vote.org and you can find all the info. Happy Voting! 🗳😃🌈1Embed

We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
Im standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, Hello
Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, Stay away from Juliet
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, Please, dont go, and I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
Ill be waiting, all theres left to do is run
Youll be the prince and Ill be the princess
Its a love story, baby, just say Yes
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, cause were dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, Stay away from Juliet

And I said, Romeo, save me, Ive been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I dont know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
Marry me, Juliet, youll never have to be alone

This is the song that got it all started for me
Its called Tim McGraw
He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, Thats a lie
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin stuck
On backroads at night
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone
But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

September saw a month of tears
And thankin God that you werent here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back
Its hard not to find it all a little bittersweet
And lookin back on all of that, its nice to believe
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
And Im back for the first time since then
Im standin on your street
And theres a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that youll read is:
Is when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday youll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
Ooh, think of me
Mmmm
He said the way my blue eyes shine
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, Thats a lie
Thank you so muchEmbed
State the obvious, I didnt get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that Im obsessive and crazy
Thats fine, Ill tell mine youre gay
By the way
I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
Youre a redneck heartbreak whos really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as Im concerned, youre just anothеr picture to burn
Theres no timе for tears
Im just sitting here planning my revenge
Theres nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddys gonna show you how sorry youll be
Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
Youre a redneck heartbreak whos really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as Im concerned, youre just another picture to burn

And if youre missing me, youd better keep it to yourself
Cause coming back around here would be bad for your health
Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
Youre a redneck heartbreak whos really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
In case you havent heard
I really really hate that
Stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
Youre a redneck heartbreak, whos really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as Im concerned or incase you havent heard
Youre knocking on a slammed door
Youre just another picture to burn
Burn, burn, burn, baby, burn
Youre just another picture to burn
Baby, burnEmbed
One, two
Well, I was riding shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
Hes got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, Baby, is something wrong?
I say, Nothing, I was just thinking
How we dont have a song
And he says
Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin out late, tapping on your window
When were on the phone and you talk real slow
Cause its late and your mama dont know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: Man, I didnt kiss her, and I should have
And when I got home fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again
I was walking up the front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way
To my lovin bed
I almost didnt notice all the roses
And the note that said

Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin out late, tapping on your window
When were on the phone and you talk real slow
Cause its late and your mama dont know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: Man, I didnt kiss her, and I should have
And when I got home fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again
Da da da da
Well, Ive heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song
Cause our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin out late, tapping on his window
When were on the phone and he talks real slow
Cause its late and his mama dont know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date: Man, I didnt kiss him, and I should have
And when I got home fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again
Play it again
Oh yeah
Oh oh yeah
I was riding shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
And I wrote down our song
Thank you so much!Embed
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he wont see
That I want and Im needing
Everything that we should be
Ill bet shes beautiful, that girl he talks about
And shes got everything that I have to live without
Drew talks to me
I laugh cause its just so funny
That I cant even see
Anyone when hes with me
He says hes so in love, hes finally got it right
I wonder if he knows hes all I think about at night
Hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
Hes the song in the car
I keep singing, dont know why I do...

Drew walks by me
Cant he tell that I cant breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be
Shed better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know shes lucky cause
Hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
Hes the song in the car
I keep singing, dont know why I do...
Hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
Hes the song in the car
I keep singing, dont know why I do...
So I drive home alone, as I turn off the light
Ill put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight
Hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who’s got enough of me to break my heart
Hes the song in the car
I keep singing, dont know why I do...
Hes the time taken up, but theres never enough
And hes all that I need to fall into
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he wont seeEmbed
Your beautiful eyes
Stare right into mine
And sometimes I think of you late at night
I dont know why, I
I wanna be somewhere where you are
I wanna be where
Youre here, your eyes are looking into mine
So baby, make me fly
My heart has never felt this way before
Im looking through your
Im looking through your eyes
I wake up, Im alive
In only a little while Ill cry
Cause youre my lullaby
So baby, come hold me tight cause I-I
I wanna be everything you need
I wanna be where

Youre here, your eyes are looking into mine
So baby, make me fly
My heart has never felt this way before
Im looking through your
Im looking through your eyes
Just as long as youre mine
Ill be your everything tonight
Let me love you, kiss you
Oh, baby, let me miss you
Let me see your
Dream about, dream about
Dream about your eyes

Hey Apple Music welcome to my Fountain Pen Playlist Most of my lyrics fall into this category
They’re modern personal stories written like poetry
Those moments that you remember all too well where you can see hear and feel everything in screaming detail
Hope you get lost in itEmbed
Untouchable like a distant diamond sky
Im reaching out and I just can’t tell you why
Im caught up in you, Im caught up in you
Untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And when you’re close, I feel like coming undone
In the middle of the night when Im in this dream
Its like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that well be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven
Its half full and I wont wait here all day
I know youre saying that youd be here anyway
But you’re untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
Now that you’re close, I feel like coming undone
In the middle of the night when Im in this dream
It’s like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that well be together
Come on, come on, oh
In the middle of the night waking from this dream
I want to feel you by my side, standing next to me
You got to come on, come on, say that well be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven

Im caught up in you
Oh, oh, oh
But you’re untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
Now that youre close, I feel like coming undone
In the middle of the night when Im in this dream
Its like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that well be together
Come on, come on, oh
In the middle of the night when Im in this dream

You got to come on, come on, say that well be together
Come on, come on, oh

I want to feel you by my side, standing next to me
You got to come on, come on, say that well be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven
And in the middle of the night when Im in this dream
Its like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, oh, oh, oh
Like a million little stars spelling out your name
Theyre spelling out your name, ohEmbed
And its a sad picture, the final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
You know its all the same, another time and place
Repeating history and youre getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And Ill do anything to see it through
Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And well sing hallelujah, well sing hallelujah
Oh, oh
So weve been outnumbered, raided, and now cornered
Its hard to fight when the fight ain’t fair
Were getting stronger now, finding things they never found
They might be bigger but were faster and never scared
You can walk away, say we dont need this
But theres something in your eyes says we can beat this
Cause these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And well sing hallelujah, well sing hallelujah
Oh, oh

Tonight we stand, get off our knees
Fight for what weve worked for all these years
And the battle was long, its the fight of our lives
But well stand up champions tonight
It was the night things changed
Can you see it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
Its a revolution, throw your hands up
Cause we never gave in
And well sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah
HallelujahEmbed

Theres something bout the way the street looks when its just rained
Theres a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot, yeah
Oh, yeah
Were driving down the road, I wonder if you know
Im trying so hard not to get caught up now
But youre just so cool, run your hands through your hair
Absentmindedly making me want you
And I dont know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I dont know why but with you Id dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless
So, baby, drive slow til we run out of road in this one horse town
I wanna stay right here, in this passengers seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now, capture it, remember it
Cause I dont know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I dont know why but with you Id dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake, Im not usually this way but
You pull me in and Im a little more brave
Its the first kiss, its flawless, really something
Its fearless
Oh, yeah
Cause I dont know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I dont know why but with you Id dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless
Cause I dont know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless

Youre
On your Grunwald
Back from the Amazon
Ah huh huh
Hes here
With doctor Don
I heard
They dropped him off
In the amazon
Ah huh huh

Ate some piranhas
Thats kinda disgusting
But whatever
Makes you happy
And I heard
Some naked boy
Showed him around
Yeah
Grunwalds
Back in townEmbed
Ah-ah
Ah-ah
Ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
Im standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, hello
Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, stay away from Juliet
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, please dont go, and I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
Ill be waiting, all theres left to do is run
Youll be the prince and Ill be the princess
Its a love story baby just say yes

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, cause were dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while
Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, Stay away from Juliet
But you were everything to me
I was begging you please dont go and I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
Ill be waiting, all theres left to do is run
Youll be the prince and Ill be the princess
Its a love story baby just say yes
Romeo, save me, theyre trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but its real
Dont be afraid, well make it out of this mess
Its a love story baby just say yes
Oh, oh
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town
And I said: Romeo, save me, Ive been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I dont know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
And said, said, said, said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
Ill be waiting, all theres left to do is run
Youll be the prince and Ill be the princess
Its a love story baby just say yes
Romeo, save me, theyre trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but its real
Dont be afraid, well make it out of this mess
Its a love story baby just say yesEmbed
Hey Apple Music, you have found my Glitter Gel Pen playlist
These are songs with lyrics that make you wanna dance, sing, and toss glitter around the room
They remind you not to take yourself too seriously, which is something we all need to hear these daysEmbed
You shouldve said, No
You  shouldve gone home
You  shouldve thought twice fore you let it all go
You shouldve know that word, bout what you did with her
Get back to me
Its  strange to think the songs we used to sing
The  smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
Yesterday I found out about you
Even  now just looking at you: feels wrong
And Yyu say that youd take it all back, given one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said, Yes
You shouldve said, No
You  shouldve gone home
You shouldve thought twice fore you let it all go
You shouldve know that word, bout what you did with her
Get back to me (Get back to me)
And I shouldve been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldnt be asking myself, Why?
You shouldnt be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You shouldve said no, baby, and you might still have me

You can see that Ive been crying
Baby, you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?
And you say that the past is the past, you need one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said, Yes
You shouldve said, No
You shouldve gone home
You shouldve thought twice fore you let it all go
You shouldve know that word, bout what you did with her
Get back to me (Get back to me)
And I shouldve been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldnt be asking myself, Why?
You shouldnt be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You shouldve said no, baby, and you might still have me
Well, I cant resist
Before you go tell me this
Was it worth it?
Was she worth this?
No no, no, no, no, no
You shouldve said, No
You shouldve gone home
You shouldve thought twice fore you let it all go
You shouldve know that word, bout what you did with her
Get back to me (Get back to me)
And I shouldve been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldnt be asking myself, Why?
You shouldnt be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You shouldve said no, baby, and you might still have me

Got caught lip-syncing at the last show
Got caught taking something my mother doesn’t know how to pronounce
Look where I got myself now
Apparently
I played the torturer in my fantasies
I guess that’s what they mean when they say
“She’s living the dream”
Look where you put me now
I cant even 
So tell me who I am
Tell me what I’ve done
Tell me who I hate
Tell me who I’ve fucked
Tell me about whatevеr you want
‘Cause I’m a lot of things
So tell me who I am
Tеll me who I love
Tell me who I hurt
Pictures of their cuts
Tell me about whatever you want
‘Cause I’m a lot of things
1 thing
I’m not innocent

1 thing
1 thing (Yeah)
1 thing (Yeah, oh)
Youre still an innocent Embed

Im standing here in the rain
Feeling lost and alone again
But I know Im not the only one
Whos been left out in the cold
Chorus (Dua Lipa & Taylor Swift):
Cause were two hearts, just trying to find our way
Through the dark, to brighter days
We can dance through the pain
Cause were two hearts, just trying to find our way
Verse 2 (Taylor Swift):
Ive been down this road before
Trying to find what Im looking for
But when Im standing here with you
I know that we can make it through
Chorus (Dua Lipa & Taylor Swift):
Cause were two hearts, just trying to find our way
Through the dark, to brighter days
We can dance through the pain
Causе were two hearts, just trying to find our way
Bridgе (Dua Lipa & Taylor Swift):
Well take it one step at a time
And well find the light
Cause when were together
Well never lose sight

Through the dark, to brighter days
We can dance through the pain

I was ridin shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
Hes got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, Baby, is something wrong?
I say, Nothin, I was just thinkin
How we dont have a song
And he says
Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin out late, tapping on your window
When were on the phone and you talk real slow
Cause its late and your mama dont know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: Man, I didnt kiss her, and I should have
And when I got home, fore I said amen
Askin God if he could play it again
I was walking up the front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong or been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way
To my lovin bed

I was born in a barn in Texas
Down on an old winding road
And thats the story of how I learned
Not to believe everything that Im told
Burn down the barn
And the photos we took
You think Ill forgive you
But youre not off the hook
You think Ill forgive you
But youre not off the hook
But despite all the warnings
And the lessons I learned
I trusted you
And then I got burned
Burn down the barn
And the photos we took
You think Ill forgive you
But youre not off the hook
You think Ill forgive you
But youre not off the hookEmbed

Now Im gonna deal you a queen from the winning hand. Her voice is full like solid gold, with some platinum blended in. Sometimes youll hear silver when she twists and twirls her notes... but gold is Brendas metal in this song I wish Id wrote. Ladies and gentlemen... Brenda Lee.
The camera then focuses on a woman in her late thirties. The music starts, and shes looking down at a framed picture. Shes at ease. She is theatrical. And she is beautiful, in a sparkling gown that matches the twinkle in her eye. Lights, camera, action. She starts to sing. Thats when you hear the gold, and you watch her as she holds the crowd in the palm of her hand. The performance ends, and the crowd goes wild. The lovely lady graciously takes a bow. She smiles out into the vast darkness, taking it all in with grace and composure. The video ends, and I reflect back on what I just saw. It was a timeless performance, but here are the facts: The year is 1983. The song is Someone Loves You Honey. The man in the tuxedo is Johnny Cash. And the woman in the beautiful dress with the honey-like voice is none other than Brenda Lee.
Brenda Lee, who was born in 1944 near Atlanta and used her prodigious singing talent to support her family after the tragic death of her father. Brenda Lee, the little girl who took over the music world with chart-topping hits when she was still a child. Brenda Lee, the woman who ushered in a new style of rock & roll and was one of the early musical artists to find her fame through television. Brenda Lee, the artist who later went back to her country roots, proving that she could create classics and break down barriers no matter what genre or category her music fell under. Brenda Lee, the singer who mastered the sound of heartbreak so flawlessly that she made audiences not only identify with her but believe her.
I watch the look on her face as she ends her song and first hears that applause. Theres a reason shes been able to move people to their feet for almost sixty years. Brenda Lee is grace. Brenda Lee is class and composure. And when she hears the roar of a crowd, Brenda Lee smiles like shes five years old and receiving her first standing ovation. Brenda Lee is someone I will always look up to because of the way she shines. As Johnny Cash said in 1983, its almost like shes golden.Embed
When it’s bad, it’s like a living nightmare
Fair enough, you’ve had many before
The ones who treated you badly
Lately, I’ve been thinking though
If you’ve been hurt
Why did you hurt me as well?
If you know that feeling
But I’m the one who needs healing?
Jekyll and Hyde
Hide your emotions
When you want to love me
You’re next to me by my side
But when you don’t feel like it
You are nowhere to be found
It’s rare
It’s funny
The juxtaposition
Drink in your hand
Mine on your waistline
Until it wears off
You and your gamе plan
Will you be around mine or hers tomorrow night
It’s cruеl
It’s love?
The juxtaposition
Did I ever get to meet the real you?
Your body was next to me
But your heart nowhere to be found
Blamed me for all of your untreated problems
Screaming, crying on your bedroom floor
Then you kissed me
Used it like a bandage
But you can’t bandage a bullet wound
Jekyll and Hyde
Hide my emotions
When you want to love me
You’re next to me by my side
But when you don’t feel like it
You are nowhere to be found
It’s rare
It’s funny
The juxtaposition
Drink in your hand
Mine on your waistline
Until it wears off
You and your game plan
Will you be around mine or hers tomorrow night
It’s cruel
It’s love?
The juxtaposition
You fall in love madly
The crying into kissing
The loving into fighting
The hurting into feelings
Then you feel like the fool, you let him in again ‘cause of the good days, good dates, good nights
You start to only remember the good parts
Not the screaming, fighting, crying and your soul dying
He sold you a fantasy, my bedroom walls tells a different story
Then he says no more
But they still put out their hand
And say let’s go
The juxtaposition
Hide my emotions
When you want to love me
You’re next to me by my side
But when you don’t feel like it
You are nowhere to be found
It’s rare
It’s funny
The juxtaposition
Drink in your hand
Mine on your waistline
Until it wears off
You and your game plan
Will you be around mine or hers tomorrow night
It’s cruel
It’s all on you?
The juxtapositionEmbed
First of all, to anyone who wrote with me in Nashville when I was in eighth or ninth grade: That is insane that you did that, and I am so lucky that I got to learn from some of the best writers on Music Row. Liz Rose was someone who spent hours and hours and hours with me when there was absolutely no sign that anything would happen in my career. My dance card was not full, I was 14, and she wrote with me so many times and taught me how to edit my ideas down into something that would pack an emotional punch.
Then, later in my career, I got to work with Max Martin and Johan Shellback, who I learned so much from a melodic sense, and I will carry those lessons with me for the rest of my life. I will learn more lessons from them next time we work together, and I feel really lucky that they’ve been a part of my life.
Jack Antonoff is such a wonderful creator and such a nurturing presence — with his own art and other artists, he’s just so versatile and such a wonderful friend. Aaron Dessner came into my life recently, and he is just such a prolific creator. All of these people changed my writing and helped shape it.
There are so many others, though. So if you’ve ever sat in a room and cowritten with me, thank you so much. Anyone who’s ever wanted to produce one of my songs, any collaborator I’ve ever had — I’ve learned from all of you. I want to say thank you to Troy Tomlinson for always being excited to hear new songs of mine, and to Jody Gerson for being such a champion of female songwriters throughout the industry.
This is something I am so proud to receive. And to the fans who are out there who care about my lyrics — you have no idea how much it means to me that you dissect them and copy them into your journals and care about the words that I write.
There are amazing songwriters who came before me who deserve this, there are incredible songwriters coming up now who are so impressive and amazing: I have such an affinity and respect for all of you. I am honored to receive this. Thank you so much.Embed
You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
Its the mornin of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you aint seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybodys way
Its your freshman year and you’re gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hopin one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
You know, I havent seen you around before
Cause when you’re fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
Youre gonna believe them
And when youre fifteen, feelin like theres nothing to figure out
Wеll, count to ten, take it in
This is life bеfore you know who youre gonna be
At fifteen
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough youre best friends
Laughin at the other girls who think theyre so cool
Well be outta here as soon as we can
And then youre on your very first date and hes got a car
And youre feelin like flyin
And your mamas waitin up and youre thinkin hes the one
And youre dancin round your room when the night ends
When the night ends (Woah, oh)
(Woah-oah)

Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
Then I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had
To a boy who changed his mind
We both cried
Cause when youre fifteen, somebody tells you they love you
Youre gonna believe them (Youre gonna believe them)
Fifteen, don’t forget to look before you fall
Ive found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who youre supposed to be
I didnt know who I was supposed to be
At fifteen
Just take a deep breath, girl
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors1Embed
Meet me at midnight
Staring at the ceiling with you
Oh, you dont ever say too much
And you dont really read into
My melancholia
I been under scrutiny (Yeah, oh, yeah)
You handle it beautifully (Yeah, oh, yeah)
All this shit is new to me (Yeah, oh, yeah)
I feel the lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal
Im damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal
The 1950s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze
All they keep asking me (All they keep asking me)
Is if Im gonna be your bride
Thе only kinda girl they see (Only kinda girl they see)
Is a one-night or a wifе

I find it dizzying (Yeah, oh, yeah)
Theyre bringing up my history (Yeah, oh, yeah)
But you werent even listening (Yeah, oh, yeah)
I feel the lavender haze creepin up on me
Surreal
Im damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal
The 1950s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender—Embed
Its strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
Yesterday I found out about you
Even now, just lookin at you feels wrong
You say that youd take it all back
Given one chance
It was a moment of weakness
And you said yes
You shouldve said no, you shouldve gone home
You shouldve thought twice fore you let it all go
You shouldve known that word
Bout what you did with her’d get back to me (Get back to me)
And I shouldve been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldnt be asking myself why
You shouldnt be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You shouldve said no
Baby, and you might still have me
You can see that Ive been cryin
And baby, you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?

You say that the past is the past
You need one chance
It was a moment of weakness
And you said yes
You shouldve said no, you shouldve gone home
You shouldve thought twice fore you let it all go
You shouldve known that word
Bout what you did with her’d get back to me (Get back to me)
And I shouldve been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldnt be asking myself why
You shouldnt be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You shouldve said no
Baby, and you might still have me
Oh, oh
I cant resist
Before you go, tell me this
Was it worth it?
Was she worth this?
No, no
No, no, no, no
You shouldve said no, you shouldve gone home
You shouldve thought twice fore you let it all go
You shouldve known that word
Bout what you did with her’d get back to me (Get back to me)
And I shouldve been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldnt be asking myself why
You shouldnt be begging for forgiveness at my feet

If you wish to romanticize the woman I became
Then say youll remember me
Standin in a nice dress
Starin at the sunset
Or you could begin at the beginning
And in that case
Please picture me in the trees
I hit my peak at seven,
Feet in the swing over the creek
I was too scared to jump in
But I was high in the sky
Pennsylvania under me
Are there still beautiful things?
Sweet tea in the summer
Cross your heart, wont tell no other
And though I cant recall your face
I still got love for you
Your braids make a pattern
Love you to the Moon and to Saturn
Passed down like folk songs
The love lasts so longEmbed
That Ive been washin’ my hands in forever
I know there is hope in these waters
But I cant bring myself to swim
When I am drowning in this silence
Baby, let me in
Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
Didnt get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose
What I chose to do
So go easy on me
There ain’t no room for things to change
When we are both so deeply stuck in our ways
You cant deny how hard I have tried
I changed who I was to put you both first
But now I give up
Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
Didnt get thе chance to
Feel the world around me
Had no timе to choose
What I chose to do
So go easy on me
I had good intentions
And the highest hopes
But I know right now
That probably doesnt even show
Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
I didnt get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose
What I chose to do
So go easy on meEmbed
I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
Ive ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, Ill watch as youre leaving
Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)
Its me, hi
Im the problem, its me
At teatime, everybody agrees
Ill stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And Im a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed

Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?
(A tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, Ill watch as youre leaving
And life will lose all its meaning

At teatime, everybody agrees
Ill stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

She thinks I left them in the will

Best believe Im still bejeweled

Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real, I polish up real nice

Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he wont see
That I want and Im needing
Everything that we should be
Ill bet shes beautiful
That girl he talks about
And shes got everything that I have to live without
Drew talks to me
I laugh cause its just so funny
That I cant even see
Anyone when hes with me
He says hes so in love
Hes finally got it right
I wonder if he knows hes all I think about at night
Hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
Hes the song in the car I keep singing
Dont know why I do

Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I cant breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be
Shed better hold him tight
Give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know shes lucky cause
Hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
Hes the song in the car I keep singing
Dont know why I do
So I drive home alone
As I turn off the light
Ill put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight
Cause hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one whos got enough for me to break my heart
Hes the song in the car I keep singing
Dont know why I do
Hes the time taken up, but theres never enough
And hes all that I need to fall into

當你想起所有的深夜
跛子在電話裡吵架
早上醒來和某人在一起
但感覺很孤獨
一顆心被畫在你的名字周圍
別人的筆跡，不是我的
偷偷進城
牽著手，只是消磨時間
你和我的過去是平行線
星星排成一行，交織在一起
並教給你
你叫我“寶貝”的方式
像對待女士一樣對待我
我只能說
你以前愛過的所有女孩（哦）
讓你成為我愛上的人
每條死胡同都把你引向我
現在你就是我所需要的，我非常感謝
你以前愛過的所有女孩
但我愛你更多

當我想到所有的妝容
鎮上的假愛（訪談）
在浴室里為某個傢伙哭泣
我現在不記得誰的名字
一個人的秘密笑話
沒有人的家，十六和野（訪談）
分手，和好
離開不說再見（訪談）
只知道
是一切成就了我
現在我叫你“寶貝”
這就是為什麼你如此了不起
你以前愛過的所有女孩（哦）
讓你成為我愛上的人
每條死胡同都把你引向我
現在你就是我所需要的，我非常感謝
你以前愛過的所有女孩
但我愛你更多
你的母親把你培養成忠誠善良的人
少年的愛情告訴你再見也有好處
你認識的每個女人都把你帶到這裡
我想教你永遠的感覺
你以前愛過的女孩（哦）
讓你成為我愛上的人
每條死胡同（死胡同）把你引向我（直向我）

And I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard
You took a step back
Without me
Without me
Without me
And hes long gone
When hes next to me
And I realize
The blame is on me
Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places Id nеver been
Til you put me down, oh
I knew you wеre trouble when you walked in
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been

Hell never see you cry

From whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt

I let my heart decide the way
When I was young
Deep down, I must have always known
That this would be inevitable
To earn my stripes, Id have to pay
And bare my soul
I know Im not the only one
Who regrets the things theyve done
Sometimes I just feel its only me
Who cant stand the reflection that they see
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Lifе was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago
When I walk around all of thе streets
Where I grew up and found my feet
They cant look me in the eye
Its like theyre scared of me
I try to think of things to say
Like a joke or a memory
But they dont recognize me now
In the light of day
I know Im not the only one
Who regrets the things theyve done
Sometimes I just feel its only me
Who never became who they thought theyd be
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago

Ich erinnere mich an deine nackten Füße, den Flur runter
Ich erinnere mich an dein kleines Lachen
Spielzeugautos auf dem Küchenboden, Plastik Dinosaurier
Ich liebe dich bis zum Mond und zurück
Ich erinnere mich an deine blauen Augen, die in meine schauen
Als hätten wir unseren eigenen geheimen Club
Ich erinnere mich daran, wie du vor dem Schlafengehen getanzt hast
Dann auf mich gesprungen bist, mich aufgeweckt hast
Ich kann dich immernoch meine Hand halten spüren, kleiner Mann
Und selbst in dem Moment, in dem ich wusste
Du hast es bekämpft wie ein Soldat
Erinner dich, ich hab mich zu dir gelehnt und geflüstert
Komm, Baby, mit mir
Wir fliegen weg von hier
Du warst die schönsten vier Jahre meines Lebens
Ich erinnere mich an die Fahr nach Hause
Als die blinde Hoffnung zum Weinen und Schreien überging:
Warum?
Blumen stapeln sich auf die schlimmste Weise, niemand weiß, was man sagen soll
Über einen wunderschönen Jungen, der starb
Und es ist schon fast Halloween
Du könntest alles sein was du willst, wenn du noch hier wärst
Ich erinnere mich an den letzten Tag, als ich den Gesicht küsste
Und in dein Ohr flüsterte

Komm, Baby, mit mir
Wir fliegen weg von hier
Raus aus diesem Raum mit Vorhang und diesem Krankenhaus-grau
Wir verschwinden einfach
Komm, Baby, mit mir
Wir fliegen weg von hier
Du warst die schönsten vier Jahre meines Lebens
Was, wenn ich in deinem Schrank stehe und versuche mit dir zu sprechen?
Was, wenn ich die getragenen Kleidungsstücke behalte, in die du niemals hereinwachsen wirst?
Und was, wenn ich wirklich dachte, irgendein Wunder würde uns da durch bringen?
Und was, wenn das Wunder es war, auch nur einen Moment mit dir zu bekommen?
Komm, Baby, mit mir
Wir fliegen weg von hier
Komm, Baby, mit mir
Wir fliegen weg von hier
Du warst die schönsten vier Jahre meines Lebens
Ich erinnere mich an deine nackten Füße, den Flur runter
Ich liebe dich bis zum Mond und zurückEmbed

I dont dress for men
Lately, Ive been dressin for revenge
I dont start shit, but I can tell you how it ends
Dont get sad, get even

I dont dress for friends

passed down like folk songs
your live lasts so longEmbed
We danced in the shadows, lost in the night
Wrapped in your embrace, everything felt right
But time had its secrets, it slowly unveiled
The cracks in our foundation, the love that had paled
Your promises whispered, I believed every word
Blinded by passion, my judgment obscured
But hindsight is cruel, it reveals the disguise
And now were left with echoes, haunting our cries
Oh, the lovе we thought we found, it slipped away somеhow
Leaving us with echoes of regret, screaming so loud
We played a dangerous game, lost in a masquerade
Now were left to face the echoes that wont fade
Echoes of regret, haunting every breath
Our love became a battlefield, a dance with certain death
But well find our strength, rise above the pain
Though this duet remains unsung, the echoes still remain
We built our castle on a crumbling ground
The pieces fell apart, crashing down all around
But through the wreckage, well emerge stronger than before
And in the echoes of regret, well find the strength to restore

Echoes of regret, haunting every breath
Our love became a battlefield, a dance with certain death
But well find our strength, rise above the pain
Though this duet remains unsung, the echoes still remain
In the depths of our hearts, a melody plays
A collaboration unheard, lost in loves maze
But well treasure the echoes, the moments we shared
For they remind us of a love that once truly caredEmbed
