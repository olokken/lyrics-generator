A club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go (Mm)
Me and my friends at the table doin' shots
Drinkin' fast and then we talk slow (Mm)
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me, I'll give it a chance now (Mm)
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance and now I'm singin' like


Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, "Boy, let's not talk too much"
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead, mm


I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is fallin' too
I'm in love with your body
And last night, you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new
Well, I'm in love with your body

Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
Well, I'm in love with your body
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I

Well, I'm in love with your body
Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new

One week in, we let the story begin
We're goin' out on our first date (Mm)
You and me are thrifty, so go all-you-can-eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate (Mm)
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doin' okay (Mm)
And leave and get in a taxi, and kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play and I'm singin' like


Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, "Boy, let's not talk too much"
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

I found a love for me
Oh, darlin', just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me


'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowin' what it was
I will not give you up this time
But, darlin', just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holdin' mine


Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darlin', you look perfect tonight


Well, I found a woman stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that, someday, I'll share her home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fightin' against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darlin', just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes


Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When I saw you in that dress, lookin' so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darlin', you look perfect tonight


No, no, no
Mm, no, no


Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
We're barefoot on the grass, oh, listenin' to our favourite song
I have faith in what I see, now I know I have met
An angel in person and she looks perfect
I don't deserve this, you look perfect tonight264Embed
166 TranslationsTürkçeEspañolPortuguêsDeutschEd Sheeran - Castle on the Hill (ترجمه ی فارسی)Ed Sheeran - Castle on the Hill (Ελληνικη μεταφραση/Greek Translation)Castle on the Hill Lyrics
When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I


Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home


I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill


Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when


We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill


One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home


And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill90Embed
131 TranslationsEspañolPortuguêsHappier Lyrics
Walking down 29th and park
I saw you in another's arm
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier
Saw you walk inside a bar
He said something to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah, you look happier, you do


Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're moving on with someone new


'Cause baby you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you


Sat in the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself
You're happier, aren't you?

Oh, ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody need you like I do
I know that there's others that deserve you
But my darling, I am still in love with you


But I guess you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I’ll feel it too
I could try to smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you


‘Cause baby you look happier, you do
I knew one day you’d fall for someone new
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do
Just know that I’ll be waiting here for you111Embed
192 TranslationsTürkçeEspañolPortuguêsItalianoΕλληνικάFrançaisThinking Out Loud Lyrics
When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?


And darling, I will be loving you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
And I'm thinking 'bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me, I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am


So honey, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are


When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same

'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
I'm thinking 'bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Well, I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand


That, baby, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are




So baby, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh, darling, place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh, baby, we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are876Embed
105 TranslationsEnglishSupermarket Flowers Lyrics
I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
I threw the day old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved
Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, "Don't you cry when you're down"
But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink


Oh, I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved


So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home"


I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face

I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know
A life with love is a life that's been lived


So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home"


Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
You got to see the person I have become
Spread your wings and I know
That when God took you back
He said, "Hallelujah, you're home"74Embed
104 TranslationsEspañolPortuguêsGalway Girl Lyrics
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"


I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance


You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl


You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me

You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl


And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night


She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl77Embed
159 TranslationsPortuguêsΕλληνικάPhotograph Lyrics
Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive


We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen, still


So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer till our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home


Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of ya
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die


We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen, still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer till our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me, well, that's okay, baby
Only words bleed inside these pages, you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home


Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home


Oh, you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were 16
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me, well, that's okay, baby
Only words bleed inside these pages
You just hold me
And I won't ever let you go


When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on 6th Street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
"Wait for me to come home"275Embed
75 TranslationsEspañolPortuguêsDive Lyrics
Oh, maybe I came on too strong
Maybe I waited too long
Maybe I played my cards wrong
Oh, just a little bit wrong
Baby, I apologize for it


I could fall or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hangin' on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And jumpin' in harder than
Ten thousand rocks on the lake


So don't call me "baby"
Unless you mean it
And don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So, let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you


You're a mystery
I have travelled the world
And there's no other girl like you
No one, what's your history? (What's your history?)
Do you have a tendency to lead some people on?
'Cause I heard you do, mmm

I could fall or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hangin' on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And lie awake every day
Don't know how much I can take


So don't call me "baby"
Unless you mean it
And don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So, let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you




Mm, I could fall or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hangin' on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
Sittin' back, lookin' at
Every mess that I made

So don't call me "baby"
Unless you mean it
And don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
And let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you
Before I dive right into you
Before I dive right into you61Embed
143 Don’t Lyrics
I met this girl late last year
She said, "Don't you worry if I disappear"
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, "I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM"
Baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singing

Don't (hhh) with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't (hhh) with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

And for a couple weeks, I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before, a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But, me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him, how I was confused about
Now she should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing

Don't (hhh) with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't (hhh) with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

(Knock, knock, knock) on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next (Get lost)
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat (Get lost)
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same (hhh) hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realized what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late, if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singing

Don't (hhh)  with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't (hhh) with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't (hhh) with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe410Embed

(One, two, three, four)
Ooh, ooh


Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful


My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's truе, it's true
My bad habits lead to you


Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lеad to you

Every pure intention ends when the good times start
Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
It started under neon lights and then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far


My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't

173 The A Team Lyrics
White lips, pale face
Breathing in the snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, days end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men


And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us


'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside tonight
And in a pipe, she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly

Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone


And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us


'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
But she don't wanna go outside tonight
And in a pipe, she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly

An angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eyes and hopin' for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line


And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us


And we're all under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And we don't wanna go outside tonight
And in a pipe, we fly to the Motherland
Or sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly

Angels to fly
Fly, fly
For angels to fly
To fly, to fly
For angels to die197Embed

84 TranslationsTürkçeI See Fire Lyrics
Oh, misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons


If this is to end in fire, then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Callin' out, Father, oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside high


And if we should die tonight, we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Callin' out, Father, oh, prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside
Desolation comes upon the sky


Now, I see fire inside the mountain
I see fire burnin' the trees
And I see fire hollowin' souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you'll remember me

Oh, should my people fall then surely, I'll do the same
Confined in mountain halls, we got too close to the flame
Callin' out, Father, oh, hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside
Desolation comes upon the sky


Now, I see fire inside the mountain
I see fire burnin' the trees
And I see fire hollowin' souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you'll remember me


And if the night is burning, I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns, then my brothers will die
And as the sky's fallin' down, it crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground, I hear my people screamin' out


Now, I see fire inside the mountains
I see fire burnin' the trees
I see fire hollowin' souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
I see fire (Oh, you know I saw a city burnin' out)
And I see fire (Feel the heat upon my skin)
And I see fire
And I see fire burn auburn on the mountain side262Embed

We are, we are, we are


L.A. on a Saturday night in the summer
Sundown and they all come out
Lamborghinis and their rented Hummers
The party's on, so they're headin' downtown ('Round here)
Everybody's lookin' for a come up
And they wanna know what you're about
Me in the middle with the one I love and
We're just tryna figure everything out


We don't fit in well 'cause we are just ourselves
I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
This is my only fear: that we become


Beautiful people
Drop top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
"What d'you do?" and "Who d'you know?"
Inside the world of beautiful people
Champagne and rolled-up notes
Prenups and broken homes
Surrounded, but still alone
Let's leave the party

That's not who we are (We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful
Yeah, that's not who we are (We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful (Beautiful)


L.A., mmm
Drove for hours last night and we made it nowhere (Nowhere, nowhere)
I see stars in your eyes when we're halfway there (All night)
I'm not fazed by all them lights and flashin' cameras
'Cause with my arms around you, there's no need to care

119 TranslationsEspañolPortuguêsEraser Lyrics
I was born inside a small town, I lost that state of mind
Learned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped the age of nine
I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride
The paving stones I played upon that kept me on the grind
So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life
Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride
And when the world's against me is when I really come alive
And every day that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride
You know that I've got whisky with white lies, and smoke in my lungs
I think life has got to the point, I know without it's no fun
I need to get in the right mind, and clear myself up
Instead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become
Guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me
Without a nine-to-five job or a uni degree
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry
Show me the locked doors, I'll find another use for the key
And you'll see


I'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me
But with that said give me one more


Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs
I chased the pictured perfect life, I think they painted it wrong
I think that money is the root of all evil, and fame is hell
Relationships, and hearts you fixed, they break as well
And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps
Because you're living your dream, man, this shit should be fun
Please know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm Reverend Run
I beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become
Conversations with my father on the A14
Age 12 telling me I've gotta chase those dreams
Now I'm playing for the people, dad, and they know me
With my beaten small guitar, wearing the same old jeans
Wembley Stadium crowd's 240 thou'
I may have grown up, but I hope that Damian's proud
And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed
The world may be filled with hate, but keep erasing it now
Somehow


I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me
But with that said give me one more


Another one to take the sting away
Oh, I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
But where I'm heading, who knows?
But my heart will stay the same
Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
But where I'm heading, who knows?
My pain eraser


And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser32Embed
196 TranslationsItalianoفارسیRemember the Name Lyrics
Yeah, I was born a misfit
Grew up 10 miles from the town of Ipswich
Wanted to make it big, I wished it to existence
I never was a sick kid, always dismissed quick
"Stick to singing, stop rappin' like it's Christmas"
And if you're talkin' money, then my conversation's shiftin'
My dreams are bigger than just bein' on the rich list
Might be insanity, but people call it "gifted"
My face is goin' numb from the shit this stuff is mixed with
Watch how the lyrics in the songs might get twisted
My wife wears red, but looks better without the lipstick
I'm a private guy and you know nothin' 'bout my business
And if I had my 15 minutes, I must have missed 'em
20 years old is when I came in the game
And now it's eight years on and you remember the name
And if you thought I was good, well, then I'm better today
But it's ironic how you people thought I'd never be great
I like my shows open-air, Tokyo to Delaware
Put your phones in the air if you wanna be rocked
You know I want way more than I already got
Give me a song with Eminem and 50 Cent in the club


You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
(Hey, hey, hey)

I can still remember (What?) tryna shop a deal (Uh-huh)
From Taco Bell to TRL
I climbed the Billboard charts to the top until
As fate would have it (Yeah), became an addict
Funny 'cause I had pop appeal
But they said time would tell (What?) if I'd prevail (Huh?)
And all I did was (What?) put nine-inch nails (Where?)
In my eyelids now (What?)
I'm seein' diamond sales like I'm in Zales (Yeah)
Without a doubt, by any means
If rap was skinny jeans, I couldn't do anything in 'em
I'd be splitting seams of denim when I'm spitting schemes
Which really means, no "if," "ands," or "buts" are squeezin' in between
You sleep on me 'cause you're only fuckin' with me in your dreams
Not even when I'm on my deathbed
Man, I feel like Ed, it isn't time to drop the mic yet
So why would I quit?
The thought that I would stop when I'm dead
Just popped in my head
I said it, then forgot what I said


It isn't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy

Ain't nobody cold as me, I dress so fresh, so clean
You can find me in my whip, rockin' my Fendi drip
Man, you know just what I mean
Shinin', wrist with the rocks on it, Buscemis with locks on it
Everything my voice on, this shit knock, don't it?
Balenciaga saga, I'm in Bergdorf ballin'
It's just another episode, my hoes, I spoil 'em
She like the fly shit and I like to buy shit
Shit, I'm gettin' stupid money, what else we gon' do with money?
Bitch, we be ballin' out, the king bring you 50 bottles
Tonight, we gon' blow a check, worry 'bout your shit tomorrow
The turn up be so real, we 'bout to be super lit
Boy, I'm kickin' straight facts, that's just how we do this shit
Tomorrow, we hangin' over 'til we start feelin' sober
Then it's time to start it over, here we go again


You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
And it's about time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy

(One, two)


Stop the clocks, it's amazing
You should see the way the light dances off your hair
A million colours of hazel, golden, and red
Saturday morning is fading
The sun's reflected by the coffee in your hand
My eyes are caught in your gaze all over again


We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle
Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow
So alone in love like the world had disappeared
Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go
I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow
And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears


Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow


The weather outside's changing
The leaves are buried under six inches of white
The radio is playing Iron & Wine
This is a new dimension
This is a level where we're losing track of time
I'm holding nothing against it, except you and I

We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle
Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow
So alone in love like the world had disappeared
Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go
I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow
And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears


Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow16Embed
84 TranslationsPortuguêsNew Man Lyrics
Nah nah nah nah nah


I heard he spent five hundred pounds on jeans
Goes to the gym at least six times a week
Wears boat shoes with no socks on his feet
And I hear he's on a new diet and watches what he eats
He's got his eyebrows plucked and his arsehole bleached
Owns every single Ministry CD
Tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means
But I heard he makes you happy, so that's fine by me
But still, I'm just keepin' it real
Still lookin' at your Instagram and I'll be creepin' a lil'
I'll be tryin' not to double tap, from way back
'Cause I know that's where the trouble's at
Let me remind you of the days when
You used to hold my hand
And when we sipped champagne out of cider cans
I guess if you were Lois Lane, I wasn't Superman
Just a young boy tryin' to be loved
So let me give it to ya


I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

Your new man rents a house in the 'burb
And wears a man bag on his shoulder, but I call it a purse
Every year, he goes to Málaga with all the fellas
Drinks beer, but has a six pack, I'm kinda jealous
He wears sunglasses indoors, in winter, at nighttime
And every time a rap song comes on, he makes a gang sign
Says "Chune, bwoydem light up the room!"
But enough about him, girl, let's talk about you
You were the type of girl who sat beside the water readin'
Eatin' a packet of crisps, but you will never find you cheatin'
Now you're eatin' kale, hittin' the gym
Keepin' up with Kylie and Kim
In the back of the club, kissin' a boy that ain't him
Okay, you need to be alone
And if you wanna talk about it, you can call my phone
I just thought I would tell you, 'cause you oughta know
You're still a young girl tryin' to be loved
So let me give it to ya


I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

Baby, I'm not tryin' to ruin your week
But you act so differently
When you're with him, I know you're lonely
Please remember you're still free
To make the choice and leave
Don't call me up, you need to show me


I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me


But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about
I don't wanna know about your new man14Embed
68 TranslationsPortuguêsHow Would You Feel (Paean) Lyrics
You are the one, girl
And you know that it's true
I'm feeling younger
Every time that I'm alone with you


We were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in a front yard
We got questions we should not ask, but


How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too


In the summer
As the lilacs bloom
Love flows deeper than the river
Every moment that I spend with you

We were sat upon our best friend's roof
I had both of my arms around you
Watching the sunrise replace the moon, but


How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too



Yeah, we were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in a front yard
We got questions we should not ask


How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
Tell me that you love me too
Tell me that you love me too
Tell me that you love me too24Embed
61 TranslationsPortuguêsNancy Mulligan Lyrics
I was twenty-four years old
When I met the woman I would call my own
Twenty-two grand kids now growing old
In that house that your brother bought ya
On the summer day when I proposed
I made that wedding ring from dentist gold
And I asked her father, but her daddy said, "No
You can't marry my daughter"


She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border


Well, I met her at Guy's in the second World War
And she was working on a soldier's ward
Never had I seen such beauty before
The moment that I saw her
Nancy was my yellow rose
And we got married wearing borrowed clothes
We got eight children, now growing old
Five sons and three daughters

She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border


From her snow white streak in her jet black hair
Over sixty years I've been loving her
Now we're sat by the fire in our old armchairs
You know Nancy, I adore ya
From a farm boy born near Belfast town
I never worried about the king and crown
'Cause I found my heart upon the southern ground
There's no difference, I assure ya


She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border27Embed

Well get up, up on the dancefloor tonight
I've got two left feet and a bottle of red wine
Making me feel like the beat and the bassline
Are in my blood, both hands up on her waistline
Get on up, baby, dance to the rhythm of the music
Don't care what the DJ chooses
Get lost in the rhythm of me
Place don't close until we wanna leave it


And you and I, we're flying on an aeroplane tonight
We're going, somewhere where the sun is shining bright
Just close your eyes
And let's pretend we're dancing in the street


In Barcelona

Well, get up, up on the dancefloor, move, it's a Saturday night

I guess that is destiny doing it right
And dance like they do in the Mediterranean
Spin you around me again and again, and
You're like something that God has sent me
I want you, baby, solamente

And you and I, we're flying on an aeroplane tonight
We're going, somewhere where the sun is shining bright
Just close your eyes

74 You Need Me, I Don’t Need You (Live at The Live Room) Lyrics
Now I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That’s you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud
And I can’t, no, I won’t hush
I’ll say the words that make you blush
I’m gonna sing this now
See, I’m true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I’m real, I do it all, it’s all me
I’m not fake, don’t ever call me lazy
I won’t stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me, hey


Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me

I sing, "I write my own tune and I write my own verse," hell
Don't need another wordsmith to make my tunes sell
Call yourself a singer-writer, you’re just bluffing
Name’s on the credits and you didn’t write nothing
I sing, fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to Brit school
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can’t last, if I’m smoking on a crack pipe
And I won’t be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia
Musically I’m demonstrating
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the enterprise when some fella filmed me
A young singer writer like a Gabriella Cilmi yeah


Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me man

All I want in this cold world is to make music and use it
Not to abuse it and get affected, infected with the who's who of music
Who did it, who is it, who's in it or what the hell does it matter?
Chitter chatter, don't matter what a yidder, yidder, yadder, it don't matter to me
All I want is a bit of dignity in me to battle this industry freely
To be me in this seedy, needy world, can you hear me?
Hey, so I keep singing that
When I first started this rapping shit I felt pressure from haters
Became invaded with sadists and just developed a hater radar
And made for the stars, kept my grind in the dark
And then appeared with a remedy kicking rhymes with a melody
Hennesey shots and Glocks, all these fools on the block
Who said you gotta be a gangster now to raise to the top?
I'm just a normal, casual, usual, everyday type of guy
With my head in the sky, Ed Sheeran, Urban Angel coming ready to die
So see the signs, stand to the side
Open your eyes and take a look and realize
The resurrection's arrived and as the mist clears
I arise from my tomb in disguise, all alone, Alonestar
Urban Angel rising from the ashes
Surprising all haters, guiding, now moving steady


You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Mummy I've got the X if you're into taking drugs
Into having sex, I ain't into making love
Come give me a hug if you're into getting rough
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bubbly
Mummy I've got the X if you're into taking drugs
Into having sex, I ain't into making love
Come give me a hug if you're into getting rough

You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me




My eyes are red, I've been burning, I've been burning
My eyes are red, I've been burning, I've been burning
My eyes are red I've been burning, I've been burning on a spliff off your high grade
My eyes are red I've been burning, I've been burning, burning, burning


Now where I come from burning weed it is a habit
A big fat bag of high grade weed, you know I got to have it
Cause if I don't have it in my pocket I'm going to panic
Cause like I said where I come from weed smoking is a habit
Yup, we'll do da bun in the place up in the hood
One of them things I have inherited like a ghetto man should
One of them things is smoking weed it yes it makes me feel good
Burning high grade sensimilla, yes it makes me feel
But me is a man, ah, talk about sensimilla is a drug
And if I start to smoke it I'mma-nna turn into a thug
Where I come from that they talking could that only get you mugged
Where I come from burning weed it is a blessing from above
Where I come from yes we bun it when we listen rub a dub
Where I come from yes we bun after we just-a make a love
Where I come from yes we bun it when the sun starts shine
I blaze high grade weed all the time!


Now my eyes are red
Cause you need me, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
And you need me, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man, I don't need you




Woooah
Woooah
Woooah
Yea


Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right
I won't stop until my name's in lights
With stadium heights, with Damian Rice
On red carpets, now I'm on Arabian Nights
Because I'm young I know my brothers gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer/songwriter, yeah
The game's over but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows but
I haven't got a house plus I live on a couch
So you believe the lyrics when I'm singing them out
Wow, from day one I've been prepared
With V05 wax for my ginger hair
Now I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of
What the future holds cause it's another day


Rucksack with the old clothes, I rap with cold flows
I'm back with the old jokes, in fact you don't know
On tracks I throw blows to make my punchlines relevant
If you can't keep up you'll get none, you're celibate
My flows developing, skin lacks the melanin
Give me a shot of adrenaline and I get it in
Do it for the hell of it
Cause ever since I hit the mainstream with The A Team I seem to sell a bit
I took what held me back with the women, then I packaged the image
Put in some content, then I sold it back as a gimmick
The fact is this, I'll end up dating actresses
Wake up on dirty mattresses, I think I'll need to practice this
But I make shit happen, call me a laxative
World's on my shoulders, I don't even know what Atlas is
Hard bars sharp like a cactus is
I'm back to rapping, back to back cause I've been practicing
I'm back to sing this


Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man


I'll keep my last name forever, keep this genre pretty basic
And I'll be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rapper shoes using new laces
I'm selling CD's from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling CD's from my rucksack aiming for the majors
Nationwide tour with Just Jack, still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache
I hit back, when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago but more people hear me though
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos
I'm always doing shows if I'm not I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up, call me Rufio

They say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator


Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you

You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me man

81 Give Me Love Lyrics
Give me love like her
'Cause lately, I've been waking up alone
Paint splattered teardrops on my shirt
Told you I'd let them go
And that I'll fight my corner
Maybe tonight, I'll call ya
After my blood turns into alcohol
No, I just wanna hold ya


Give a little time to me or burn this out
We’ll play hide and seek to turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow


My-my, my-my-y, oh, give me love
My-my, my-my-y, oh, give me love
My-my, my-my-y, oh, give me love
My-my, my-my-y, oh, give me love
My-my, my-my-y, give me love


Give me love like never before
'Cause lately, I've been craving more
And it's been a while, but I still feel the same
Maybe I should let you go
You know I'll fight my corner
And that tonight, I'll call ya
After my blood is drowning in alcohol, mm-mmh
No, I just wanna hold ya

Give a little time to me or burn this out
We’ll play hide and seek to turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow
My-my, my-my-y, oh, give me love
Give a little time to me or burn this out
We’ll play hide and seek to turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow

I took an arrow to the heart
I never kissed a mouth that tastes like yours
Strawberries and then somethin' more
Ooh, yeah, I want it all
Lipstick on my guitar
Fill up the engine, we can drive real far
Go dancin' underneath the stars
Ooh, yeah, I want it all
Mmm, you got me feelin' like


I wanna be that guy, I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile, I wanna feel like I'm
Like my soul's on fire, I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah, you got me singin' like


Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give mе the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til thе sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back
And we'll say, "Ooh, I love it when you do it like that"
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back

Into the car
On the backseat in the moonlit dark
Wrap me up between your legs and arms
Ooh, I can't get enough
You know you could tear me apart
Put me back together and take my heart
I never thought that I could love this hard
Ooh, I can't get enough
Mmm, you got me feelin' like


I wanna be that guy, I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile, I wanna feel like I'm
Like my soul's on fire, I wanna stay up all day and all night

34 Kiss Me Lyrics
One, two, three, four


Settle down with me
Cover me up, cuddle me in
Lie down with me, yeah
And hold me in your arms


And your heart's against my chest
Your lips pressed to my neck
I'm falling for your eyes
But they don't know me yet
And with a feeling I'll forget, I'm in love now


Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
We're falling in love
We're falling in love


Settle down with me
And I'll be your safety
You'll be my lady
I was made to keep your body warm
But I'm cold as the wind blows
So hold me in your arms
Oh, no

My heart's against your chest
Your lips pressed to my neck
I'm falling for your eyes
But they don't know me yet
And with this feeling I'll forget, I'm in love now


Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
We're falling in love
We're falling in love




Yeah, I've been feeling everything
From hate to love
From love to lust
From lust to truth
I guess that's how I know you
So I hold you close to help you give it up


So kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
We're falling in love
We're falling in love
Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved

89 You Need Me, I Don’t Need You Lyrics
I don't want bruise your ears
Or hurt you again
But I got back-stabbed by a black cab
When I needed a friend


Now, I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That’s you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud
And I can't, no, I won't hush
I'll say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now (Oh, oh)
See, I’m true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now, that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me


'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me

I sing and write my own tune and I write my own verse, hell
Don't need another wordsmith to make my tunes sell
Call yourself a singer-writer, you're just bluffin'
Name's on the credits and you didn't write nothin'
I sing fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to BRIT School
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can't last if I'm smokin' on a crack pipe
And I won't be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear in Wikipedia
And musically, I'm demonstratin'
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the enterprise when some fella filmed me
A young singer-writer like a Gabriella Cilmi


'Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me

'Cause with the lyrics, I'll be aimin' it right
I won't stop 'til my name's in lights at stadium heights, with Damien Rice
On red carpets, now, I'm on Arabian Nights
Because I'm young, I know my brother's gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I'd gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter, yeah
The game's over but now, I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows, but
I haven't got a house, plus I live on a couch
So you believe the lyrics when I'm singin' them out
Wow, from day one, I've been prepared
With V05 wax for my ginger hair
So now, I'm back to the sofa givin' a dose of
What the future holds 'cause it's another day
Plus I'll keep my last name forever, keep this genre pretty basic
Gonna be breakin' into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Slipping into another rapper's shoes usin' new laces
I'm sellin' CDs from my rucksack aimin' for the papers
Sellin' CDs from my rucksack aimin' for the majors
Nationwide tour with Just Jack, still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the moustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago, but more people hear me, though
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos
I'm always doin' shows, if I'm not, I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growin' up, call me Rufio

63 Lego House Lyrics
I'm gonna pick up the pieces
And build a LEGO house
If things go wrong, we can knock it down
My three words have two meanings
But there's one thing on my mind
It's all for you


And it's dark in a cold December
But I've got you to keep me warm
If you're broken, I'll mend ya
And I'll keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now


I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're gettin' down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
Now


I'm gonna paint you by numbers
And colour you in
If things go right, we can frame it
And put you on a wall
And it's so hard to say it
But I've been here before
Now, I'll surrender up my heart
And swap it for yours

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're gettin' down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now


Don't hold me down
I think the braces are breaking
And it's more than I can take


And it's dark in a cold December
But I've got you to keep me warm
If you're broken, I'll mend ya
And I'll keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now


I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're gettin' down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're gettin' down
And out of all these things I've done
I will love you better now98Embed
87 TranslationsEspañolPortuguêsWhat Do I Know? Lyrics
Ain't got a soapbox I can stand upon
But God gave me a stage, a guitar and a song
My daddy told me, "Son, don't you get involved in
Politics, religions, other peoples' quarrels"


I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
I know when I have children they will know what it means
And I pass on these things my family's given to me
Just love, and understanding positivity


We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but lord knows
Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashing and their portfolios
While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote
Sing, love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment

The revolution's coming, it's a minute away
I saw people marching in the streets today
You know we are made up of love and hate
But both of them are balanced on a razor blade


I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
I know, I'm all for people following their dreams
Just re-remember life is more than fittin' in your jeans
It's love and understanding positivity


We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but lord knows
Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashing and their portfolios
While I'll be sitting here with a song I wrote
Sing, love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment

I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
You know, the future's in the hands of you and me
So let's all get together, we can all be free
Spread love and understanding, positivity


We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but lord knows
Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashing and their portfolios
While I'll be sitting here with a song I wrote
Sing, love could change the world in a moment

I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
So I could just show up and bring the news
That she's getting older and I wish that you'd met her
The things that she'll learn from me, I got them all from you


Can I just stay a while and we'll put all the world to rights?
The little ones will grow and I'll still drink your favourite wine
And soon, they're going to close, but I'll see you another day
So much has changed since you've been away


I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
So I could just swing by and ask your advice
What would you do in my situation?
I hadn't a clue how I'd even raise them
What would you do? 'Cause you always do what's right


Can we just talk a while until my worries disappear?
I'd tell you that I'm scared of turning out a failure
You'd say, "Remember that the answer's in the love that we create"
So much has changed since you've been away


I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
And I would ask them if I could take you home
But I know what they'd say, that it's for the best
So I will live life the way you taught me
And make it on my own

And I will close the door, but I will open up my heart
And everyone I love will know exactly who you are
'Cause this is not goodbye, it is just 'til we meet again
So much has changed since you've been away21Embed

39 Shape of You (Stormzy Remix) Lyrics
A club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go (Mm)
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinkin' fast, and then we talk slow (Mm)
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me, I'll give it a chance now (Mm)
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singin' like


Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, "Boy, let's not talk too much"
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead, mm


I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is fallin' too
I'm in love with your body
And last night, you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new
Well, I'm in love with your body

Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
Well, I'm in love with your body
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
Well, I'm in love with your body
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
Well, I'm in love with your body
Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you (Check it)


I gotta tell you, I'm in love with your shape
You said them other bruddas couldn't really juggle your weight
And you were shy in the beginning, used to cover your face
You got that sweet, sweet loving, I'm a sucker for cake
I know, girl, you got a body they would kill for
Love you through whatever, who you tryna skip a meal for?
Girl, you're too precious, why you tryna split the bill for?
I ain't even gassing, they should have you up on billboards, that's real talk
And you can go to work and let me pick up the slack
And when you finished what you're doing, we'll be kicking it back
We can listen to my tunes until you're sick of my raps
And I got money in the bank, but not a figure like that
You got me looking at your shape, man, I've already won
Tryna come and kill the game like my brother Teddy done
I ain't even tryna play it cool 'cuh this is bigger than my pride
Let me multiply your lovin', then I hit you with Divide
Ayy, check

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is fallin' too
I'm in love with your body
And last night, you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new
Well, I'm in love with your body


Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
Well, I'm in love with your body
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
Well, I'm in love with your body
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
Well, I'm in love with your body
Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you


Come on, be my baby, come on
Pour out my liquor, there's not a flaw in your figure, I'm so impressed
Come on, be my baby, come on
And baby, you can call me, it's quicker, I don't be talking on Twitter, girl, that is dead
Come on, be my baby, come on
Girl, stop curbing the question, I'll turn your curse to a blessing, that's overnight
Come on, be my baby, come on
Weigh up your options and spend a day with The Problem, I'll do you right

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is fallin' too
I'm in love with your body
And last night, you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new
Well, I'm in love with your body


Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on (I'm in love with your body)
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on (I'm in love with your body)
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on (I'm in love with your body)

55 TranslationsPortuguêsSave Myself Lyrics
I gave all my oxygen to people that could breathe
I gave away my money and now we don't even speak
I drove miles and miles, but would you do the same for me?
Oh, honestly?
Offered off my shoulder just for you to cry upon
Gave you constant shelter and a bed to keep you warm
They gave me the heartache and in return I gave a song
It goes on and on


Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf
No farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself


I gave you all my energy and I took away your pain
'Cause human beings are destined to radiate or drain
What line do we stand upon, 'cause from here it looks the same
And only scars remain


Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf
No farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself

But if I don't
Then I'll go back
To where I'm rescuing a stranger
Just because they needed saving just like that
Oh, I'm here again
Between the devil and the danger
But I guess it's just my nature
My dad was wrong
'Cause I'm not like my mum
'Cause she'd just smile and I'm complaining in a song
But it helps
So before I save someone else
I've got to save myself


Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf
No farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself
And before I blame someone else, I've got to save myself
And before I love someone else, I've got to love myself25Embed
37 TranslationsEspañolTenerife Sea Lyrics
You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
The way it falls on the side of your neck
Down your shoulders and back
We are surrounded by all of these lies
And people that talk too much
You got the kind of look in your eyes
As if no one knows anything but us


Should this be the last thing I see?
I want you to know it's enough for me
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need


I'm so in love
So in love
So in love
So in love


You look so beautiful in this light
Your silhouette over me
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes
Is the Tenerife sea
And all of the voices surrounding us here
They just fade out when you take a breath
Just say the word and I will disappear
Into the wilderness

Should this be the last thing I see?
I want you to know it's enough for me
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need


I'm so in love
So in love
So in love
So in love


Lumiere, darling
Lumiere over me
Lumiere, darling
Lumiere over me
Lumiere, darling
Lumiere over me


Should this be the last thing I see?
I want you to know it's enough for me
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need


So in love
So in love
So in love
So in love

You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
And in a moment, I knew you, Beth65Embed
61 TranslationsPortuguêsHearts Don’t Break Around Here Lyrics
She is the sweetest thing that I know
Should see the way she holds me when the lights go low
Shakes my soul like a pothole every time
Took my heart upon a one way trip
Guess she went wandering off with it
And unlike most women I know
This one will bring it back whole
Daisies, daisies perched upon your forehead
Oh my baby, lately I know


That every night I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear
"Oh, we're in love, aren't we?"
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah


She is the river flow in Orwell
And tin wind chimes used for doorbells
Fields and trees and her smell fill my lungs
Spend my summertime beside her
And the rest of the year, the same
She is the flint that sparks the lighter
And the fuel that will hold the flame, oh
Roses, roses laid upon your bed spread, oh my
All this, all this I know

But every night I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear
"Oh, we're in love, aren't we?"
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah


Well, I found love hidden inside
The arms of the woman I know
She is the lighthouse in the night
That will safely guide me home
And I'm not scared of passing over
Or the thought of growing old
'Cause from now until I go


Every night I kiss you, you'll say in my ear
"Oh, we're in love, aren't we?"
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah, yeah
Every night I kiss you, you'll say in my ear
"Oh, we're in love, aren't we?"
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah15Embed

Bibia be ye ye


I lost my shoes last night, I don't know where I put my keys
I was tired and fell asleep beneath an oak tree
I bet my mother's proud of me from each scar
Upon my knuckle and each graze upon my knee, and all I know
Is I got a cab and then threw up on his car seat
He kicked me out and then I walked in the rain
I tell myself in every way I won't be doing this again
And tomorrow's a brand new day


Someone told me, "Always say what's on your mind"
And I am only being honest with you, I
I get lonely and make mistakes from time to time
Se enioma enko ye, bibia be ye ye
Bibia be ye ye, ye ye, ye ye
Bibia be ye ye


I remember less and less and mostly things that I regret
In my phone are several texts, from girls I've never met
And in the pocket of my jeans are only coins and broken dreams
My heart is breaking at the seams and I'm coming apart now
Now things are looking up, I'll find my shoes right next to the oak tree
And I'll get a bus straight into town and spend the afternoon
Looking around for the things that I left on the ground
And say you're with me, tomorrow's a brand new day

Someone told me, "Always say what's on your mind"
And I am only being honest with you, I
I get lonely and make mistakes from time to time

52 I’m a Mess Lyrics
Oh, I'm a mess right now, inside out
Searching for a sweet surrender, but this is not the end
I can't work it out, how
Going through the motions, going through us


And oh, I've known it for the longest time
And all of my hopes, all of my words
Are all over written on the signs
When you're on my road walking me home
Home, home, home, home


See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love, no
Easy baby, maybe I'm a liar
But for tonight, I wanna fall in love
Put your faith in my stomach


I messed up this time, late last night
Drinking to suppress devotion, with fingers intertwined
I can't shake this feeling now
We're going through the motions, hoping you'd stop

And oh, I've only caused you pain, you know
But all of my words will always be low
Of all, all the love we spoke
When you're on my road walking me home
Home, home, home, home


See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love, no
Easy baby, maybe I'm a liar
But for tonight, I wanna fall in love
Put your faith in my stomach


And for how long I love my lover?
For how long I love my lover, now, now?
For how long, long I love my lover, now, now?
For how long, long I love my lover, now, now?
For how long, long I love my lover, now, now? (And I feel love)
For how long, long I love my lover?
(Feel it all over now, now, and I feel love)
For how long, long I love my lover, now, now
(Feel it all over now, now, and I feel love)
For how long, long I love my lover, now, now
(Feel it all over now, now, and I feel love)
For how long, long I love my lover, now, now
(Feel it all over now, now, and I feel love)
For how long, long I love my lover, now, now
(Feel it all over now, now, and I feel love)

For how long I love my lover, now, now?
For how long, long I love my lover?87Embed
63 TranslationsEspañolSing Lyrics
It's late in the evening
Glass on the side
I've been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignorin' everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
I don't wanna know
If you're gettin' ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no-man's land
And for the longest time, lady


I need you, darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin'
Won’t you let me know?
Oh-oh, ooh-ooh
Oh-oh, ooh-ooh
If you love me
Come on, get involved

This love is ablaze, I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then, we got nothin' to say and nothin' to know
But somethin' to drink and maybe somethin' to smoke
Let it go until our roads are changed
Singin' "We Found Love" in a local rave
No, I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out, then hope and pray
I told her my name, then said "It's nice to meet you"
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know if she's a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness, I'm in
Deep **** if anybody finds out
I meant to drive home but I drunk all of it now
Not soberin' up, we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another, now, she's kissin' my mouth

I need you, darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin'
Won’t you let me know?
Oh-oh, ooh-ooh
Oh-oh, ooh-ooh
If you love me
Come on, get involved
Feel it rushin' through you
From your head to toe

Sing!
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh


Can you feel it?
All the guys in here don't even wanna dance
Can you feel it?
All that I can hear is music from the back
But can you feel it?
Found you hidin' here so won't you take my hand, darlin'?
Before the beat kicks in again
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

Sing!
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) I need you, darling
(Oh-oh-oh-oh) Come on, set the tone

90 Take Me Back to London Lyrics
Jet plane headed up to the sky
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high
We ain't hit a rave in a while
So take me back to London (Yo)


I do deals, but I never get twanged (Twanged)
Moves that ain't ever been planned (Planned)
No goons that were never in gangs (Gangs)
Where I'm from, chat shit get banged (What?)
Where I'm from, chat shit, let a 12 gauge rip
Yeah, it's sick how it fits in my hand (Hand)
I don't mix with the glitz and the glam (Glam)
All these stupid pricks on the 'Gram
I don't do online beef, or neeky grime beef
I'm way too G'd up to beef with grime neek
I bought an AP to help me time keep
My shooter ride deep, he moves when I speak
My shooter ride (Ride), he shoot a guy (Guy)
Leave you wet like you scuba dived
We were younger then and now we're unified
South London boys, get you crucified, I'm gone


It's that time
Big Mike and Teddy are on grime
I wanna try new things, they just want me to sing
Because nobody thinks I write rhymes
And now I'm back in the bits with my guy
Give me a packet of crisps with my pint
I hit my friends up, go straight to the pub
'Cause I haven't been home in time, yes, I
But that's my fault (Oh)
Grossed half a billi' on the Divide Tour (Oh)
Yes, I ain't kidding, what would I lie for? (Oh)
But now I'm back on the track with Big Michael (Woah)
He said, "Teddy, never get off your high horse
And never let 'em take your crown"
I've been away for a while, traveled a million miles
But I'm heading back to London town right now

Jet plane headed up to the sky (To the sky)
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high (Woop, woop)
We ain't hit a rave in a while (In a while)
So take me back to London
Bass high, middle nights, ceilin' low (Ceilin' low)
Sweat brow drippin' down, when in Rome (When in Rome)
No town does it quite like my home
So take me back to London


Yo, when I squeeze off this little pen of mine
Done the remix, now I got Ed on grime
And this ain't like any top ten of mine
I arrived at Wembley ahead of time
And that's stadiums, man are aliens
I drink supermalts and Vibranium
I got an RM11 titanium
And I rock a 5970 daily, but
I want soul, I want flows
Don't need tags ripping off my clothes
Don't need pricks blowin' up my phone
And Ted said, "That's just the way things go"
It's just the way things go, amazin' flows
Grime or rap, man, I gave 'em both
Took this sound that was made in Bow
Went global, man, now the case is closed
2015 in a Badingham pub
I told Stormz two years, he'll be wrappin' it up
And you'll go through tears with the people you love
But when you get to the top, man, it's never enough
'Cause you can win BRITs (It don't stop)
And you can do Glasto (Headline slot)
But when you're miles away and you're feelin' alone
Gotta remember that there ain't no place like home

Jet plane headed up to the sky (To the sky)
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high (Getting high)
We ain't hit a rave in a while (In a while)
So take me back to London
Bass high, middle nights, ceilin' low (Ceilin' low)
Sweat brow drippin' down, when in Rome (When in Rome)
No town does it quite like my home (Like my home)
So take me back to London
So take me back to London16Embed
63 TranslationsEspañolPortuguêsOne Lyrics
Tell me that you'll turn down the man
Who asks for your hand
'Cause you're waitin' for me
And I know you're gonna be away a while
But I've got no plans at all to leave


And would you take away my hopes and dreams?
And just stay with me, ooh


All my senses come to life
While I'm stumblin' home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me you'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one


Take my hand and my
Heart and soul, I will
Only have these eyes for you
And you know everything changes but
We'll be strangers if we see this through

You could stay within these walls and bleed
Or just stay with me, oh, Lord, now


All my senses come to life
While I'm stumblin' home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me you'll always be a friend
'Cause you are the only one


Stumblin' half drunk, gettin' myself lost
I am so gone, so tell me the way home
I listen to sad songs singin' about love
And where it goes wrong


All my senses come to life
While I'm stumblin' home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me you'll always be a friend
'Cause you are the only one79Embed
41 Bloodstream Lyrics
I've been spinning now for time
Couple women by my side
I got sinnin' on my mind
Sippin' on red wine
I've been sitting here for ages
Ripping out the pages
How'd I get so faded?
How'd I get so faded?


Oh, no, no, don't leave me lonely now
If you loved me, how'd you never learn?
Ooh, coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind


This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals
Burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals
Burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in
Well, tell me when it kicks in

I've been looking for a lover
Thought I'd find her in a bottle
God, make me another one
I'll be feeling this tomorrow
Lord, forgive me for the things I've done
I was never meant to hurt no one
I saw scars upon a broken-hearted lover


Oh, no, no, don't leave me lonely now
If you loved me, how'd you never learn?
Ooh, coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind


This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals
Burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals
Burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in
Well, tell me when it kicks in
Tell me when it kicks in

All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind (Tell me when it kicks in)
Calling out across the line (And I saw scars upon her)
All the voices in my mind (Tell me when it kicks in)
Calling out across the line (Brokenhearted)
All the voices in my mind (Tell me when it kicks in)
Calling out across the line (And I saw scars upon her)
All the voices in my mind (Tell me when it kicks in)

43 TranslationsEspañolAfire Love Lyrics
Things were all good yesterday
And then the devil took your memory
And if you fell to your death today
I hope that Heaven is your resting place
I heard the doctors put your chest in pain
But then that could've been the medicine
And now you're lyin' in the bed again
Either way, I'll cry with the rest of them


And my father told me, "Son
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face
And you're not the only one"
Although my grandma used to say
That he used to sing


Darlin', hold me in your
Arms the way you did last night
And we'll lie inside
For a little while here, oh
I could look into your eyes
Until the sun comes up
And we're wrapped in light
And life and love
Put your open lips on mine
And slowly let them shut
For they're designed
To be together, oh
With your body next to mine
Our hearts will beat as one
And we're set alight
We're afire love
Oh, love

And things were all good yesterday
But then the devil took your breath away
And now, we're left here in the pain
Black suit, black tie, standin' in the rain
And now, my family is one again
Stapled together with the strangers and a friend
Came to my mind, I should paint it with a pen
Six years old, I remember when


My father
Told me, "Son
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face
And you're not the only one"
Although my grandma used to say
That he used to sing


Darlin', hold me in your
Arms the way you did last night
And we'll lie inside
For a little while here, oh
I could look into your eyes
Until the sun comes up
And we're wrapped in light
And life and love
Put your open lips on mine
And slowly let them shut
For they're designed
To be together, oh
With your body next to mine
Our hearts will beat as one
And we're set alight
We're afire love
Oh, love

And my father and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah
And my brother and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah
And my brother and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah
And all my brothers and my sisters
And my father and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah92Embed
60 U.N.I. Lyrics
I found your hairband on my bedroom floor
The only evidence that you've been here before
And I don't get waves of missing you anymore
They're more like tsunami tides in my eyes
Never getting dry, so I get high
Smoke away the days, never sleep with the light on
Weeks pass in the blink of an eye
And I'm still drunk at the end of the night
I don't drink like everybody else
I do it to forget things about myself
Stumble and fall with the head spin I've got
My mind's with you but my heart's just not


So am I close to you anymore if it's over
And there's no chance that we'll work it out?


That's why you and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied

Everybody said we'd be together forever but I know that
I never wanna settle down, come around
Break up the love like Lego now
Never wanna turn into another "like you"
Sleep with my thoughts, dance with my views
Everything’s great, not everything’s sure
But you live in your halls and I live in a tour bus
Now, I'm in a position to be another stalker
Like every thing I say seems to always sound awkward
Like our last kiss, it was perfect
We were nervous on the surface
And I'm always saying everyday that it was worth it
Pain is only relevant if it still hurts
I forget like an elephant, or we can use a sedative
And go back to the day we fell in love just on our first kiss


So am I close to you anymore if it's over
And there's no chance that we'll work it out?


Oh, you and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied

Because if I was gonna go somewhere, I'd be there by now
And maybe I can let myself down (Wo-oahh)
And I'm thinking I'm unaware, I keep my feet on the ground
Keep looking around to make sure I'm not the only one to feel low
Because if you want, I'll take you in my arms and keep you sheltered
From all that I've done wrong
And I know you'll say that I'm the only one
But I know God made another one of me
To love you better than I ever will


'Cause you and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied45Embed
65 Take It Back Lyrics
I'm not a rapper, I'm a singer with a flow
I've got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics, you know
You'll find me ripping the writtens out of the pages they sit in
I never want to get bitten 'cause plagiarism is hidden
Watch how I sit on the rhythm, prisoner with the vision
Signed to a label but didn't listen to any criticism
Thought you knew but you didn't, so perk your ears up and listen
Studio is a system and you could say that I'm driven
And now it's onto the next saga, we drink the best lager
I'll never try to win you over like your stepfather
I'll do my own thing now and get respect after
And I'm avoiding the 'caine like it was Get Carter
For four years I never had a place to stay
But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight
At 16 years old, yeah, I moved out of my home
I was Macy Gray, I tried to say goodbye and I choked
And went from sleeping at a subway station
To sleeping with a movie star and adding to the population
Not my imagination, I don't wanna relax
Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax? I'll take it back now


Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No

I take it back with the rhythm and blues
With my rap pack, I'll be singing the news
Tryna act like Jack Black when I bring it to school
I'll make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop
Bringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes
I'll give you the truth through the vocal booth
And stars burst out on the scene like an Opal Fruit
They try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot
But then again that's what they're supposed to do
And I'm supposed to be calm, I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm
Whispering, "Everything that happens is from now on"
I'll be ready to start again by the end of the song
And still they're claiming that I handle it wrong
But then I've never had an enemy except the NME
But I'll be selling twice as many copies as their magazines'll ever be
With only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees
Are healthier than a dalmatian on Pedigree
Singing for the masses, rubber dinghy rapids
I keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic
I'm battling for respect, and I don't know if I'll have it
This song's from the heart, covered the planet, I'll take it back now


Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No, I'll take it back now

Now, I don't ever wanna be perfect
'Cause I'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless
And I accept the fact that someone's gotta win worst-dressed
Taking my first steps into the scene, giving me focus
Putting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton
Considering a name change, thinking it was hopeless
Rhyming over recordings, avoiding tradition
'Cause every day some lyrics and a melody could be written
Now absence can make your heart ache
But drinking Absinthe can change your mind state
Vividly, need to let my liver be
And I'll say it again, living life on the edge with a closed handful of friends
It's good advice from the man who took his life on the road with me
And I hope to see him blowing up globally
'Cause that's how it's supposed to be, I'm screaming out vocally
It might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams, but
But I just write schemes
I'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans
Madison Square Garden is where I might be, but more likely
You'll find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates
Having a pint with McDaid, discussing records we made
And every single second knowing that we'll never betray
The way we were raised, remembering our background, sat down
That's how we plan it out, it's time to take it back now

Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No
Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No


My dreams keep me awake at night, written in rhyme
Till I deliver the hype, am I just living a lie?
With this you must know that the numbers just sold
Will keep me going through the tough times, dream with me
We forget 90 percent of it when we wake
But the other 10 percent, it never fades
Dreaming dreams of day-to-day goals, stay awake loads
Tried to make the cut like the paper with a razor blade
Oh, never give up, just remember just to hold out more
A couple years ago I couldn't just control that thought
You'd find me busking on the street when it was cold outdoors
Now I'm sweating on the stage of a sold-out tour
Writing love songs for the sake of it, never to make a hit
You can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick
I'm not a rapper, I'm a singer, I just take the piss
And most of these other guys are kids that pose
His little sister has to babysit, that's just the way it is
Dreams are your own, just set your goals and have the upmost faith in it
Tread your own path, you'll never make it as a follower
You'll never know where you will go or you will be tomorrow

39 Take Me Back To London (Remix) Lyrics
Jet plane headed up to the sky
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high
We ain't hit a rave in a while
So take me back to London (Yo)


I do deals, but I never get twanged (Twanged)
Moves that ain't ever been planned (Planned)
No goons that were never in gangs (Gangs)
Where I'm from, chat shit get banged (What?)
Where I'm from, chat shit, let a 12 gauge rip
Yeah, it's sick how it fits in my hand (Hand)
I don't mix with the glitz and the glam (Glam)
All these stupid pricks on the 'Gram
I don't do online beef, or neeky grime beef
I'm way too G'd up to beef with grime neek
I bought an AP to help me time keep
My shooter ride deep, he moves when I speak
My shooter ride (Ride), he shoot a guy (Guy)
Leave you wet like you scuba dived
We were younger then and now we're unified
South London boys, get you crucified, I'm gone


It's that time
Big Mike and Teddy are on grime
I wanna try new things, they just want me to sing
Because nobody thinks I write rhymes
And now I'm back in the bits with my guy
Give me a packet of crisps with my pint
I hit my friends up, go straight to the pub
'Cause I haven't been home in time, yes, I
But that's my fault  (Oh)
Grossed half a billi' on the Divide Tour (Oh)
Yes, I ain't kidding, what would I lie for? (Oh)
But now I'm back on the track with Big Michael (Whoa)
He said, "Teddy, never get off your high horse
And never let 'em take your crown"
I've been away for a while, travelled a million miles
But I'm heading back to London town right now

Jet plane headed up to the sky (To the sky)
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high (Woop, woop)
We ain't hit a rave in a while (In a what?)
So take me back to London
Bass high, middle nights, ceilin' low (Ceilin' low)
Sweat brow drippin' down, when in Rome (When in Rome)
No town does it quite like my home (They don't)
So take me back to—


Birmingham, 0121 stand up!
You better tell them the hooligan's here
My team can't lose when I'm here
Outside, quick twos and a beer
You see me when I choose to appear
Just paid a few bag for my carpet
Blud, take off your shoes when you're here
Yo, I can turn boos into cheers
Tiptronic man cruise through the gears
Rep blues when I'm here
It's Brum
Fam, are you dumb?
Red red wine or you want a redrum
You can be forty, you don't wanna war me
End of story, you're gunna get spun
Man smoke weed 'til my whole head's numb
Don't talk greaze cos I won't take none
VIP in my own section
Wild, wild west with the old western, it's Brum!

Old school raving, back to scally
And the AP, packed with gally
Take me back to Manny
Blacked out Roll full of yack and maggy
And a S3 boot full of packs of Cali
Hit the booth, man, slap it snappy
Bap bap, that's that, track wrapped, I'm happy
Some man are blessed, some are bad and trappy
Gets cold up north, pack your hat and trackie'
Huh, man was made to set pace
Young Aitch, I came for first place
Made a change to get paid
Fam, I stayed in my lane and came with that flame
Day to day we on stage
Make my K, then I skate and catch the next plane
Baking up when I wake
Rake it up, get it saved
It's make it or break


It's make it or break
Human man, still make a mistake
Mad now Aitch just made a mixtape
Told Jaykae to make the next eight
We 'bout to set pace, I can't get about no more it gets bait
And I don't get head no more, I get face
She don't want him no more, she wants Jay
And she don't want me no more, she wants Aitch (Aye)
Jaykae, make a lot of P (Uh)
Go straight there if that's where I've got to be
Wait, stop, pop my collar, I'm a G
5 million minimum, what I wanna see
I ain't in it for the money, put that to bed
Tell mumsy that I'm on a track with Ed
Aim this one at your head
Write bars with a pen on a pad when the battery's dead

Jet plane headed up to the sky (0161)
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high (0121)
We ain't hit a rave in a while (London City)
So take me back to London (Woo)
Bass high, middle nights, ceilin' low
Sweat brow drippin' down, when in Rome
No town does it quite like my home (Like my home)
So take me back to London4Embed
42 TranslationsFrançaisBest Part of Me Lyrics
My lungs are black, my heart is pure
My hands are scarred from nights before
And my hair is thin and falling out of all the wrong places
I am a little insecure
My eyes are crossed, but they're still blue
I bite my nails and tell the truth
I go from thin to overweight, day to day, it fluctuates
My skin is inked, but faded too


But she loves me, she loves me
Why the hell does she love me
When she could have anyone else?
Oh, you love me, you love me
Why the hell do you love me?
'Cause I don't even love myself


Baby, the best part of me is you
And lately, everything's making sense too
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you


I overthink and still forget
I lose my phone and place my bets
And I never catch the train on time
Always thirty minutes behind
Your worries ain't seen nothin' yet

But you love me, you love me
Why the hell you love me so
When you could have anyone else?
Yeah, yeah, he loves me, he loves me
And I bet he never lets me go
And shows me how to love myself


'Cause, baby, the best part of me is you
Oh, lately, everything's making sense too
Baby, I'm so in love with you


With you
Da-dum, da-dum, da-dum, da-dum


Baby, the best part of me is you (Whoa)

59 Small Bump Lyrics
You're just a small bump unborn
In four months, you're brought to life
You might be left with my hair
But you'll have your mother's eyes
I'll hold your body in my hands, be as gentle as I can
But for now, you're a scan of my unmade plans
A small bump, in four months, you're brought to life


And I'll whisper quietly
I'll give you nothin' but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you


You are my one and only
And you can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb
And hold me tight
Oh, you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb
And hold me tight
And you'll be all right


Ooh, you're just a small bump unknown, you'll grow into your skin
With a smile like hers and a dimple beneath your chin
Finger nails the size of a half grain of rice
And eyelids closed to be soon opened wide
A small bump, in four months, you'll open your eyes

And I'll hold you tightly
I'll tell you nothin' but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you


You are my one and only
And you can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb
And hold me tight
Oh, you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb
And hold me tight
And you'll be all right


And you can lie with me
With your tiny feet
When you're half asleep
I'll leave you be
Right in front of me
For a couple weeks
So I can keep you safe


'Cause you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb
And hold me tight
Oh, you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb
And hold me tight
And you'll be all right

'Cause you were just a small bump unborn
For four months then torn from life
Maybe you were needed up there
But we're still unaware as why43Embed

How was I to know? It's a crazy thing
I showed you my hand and you still let me win
And who was I to say that this was meant to be?
The road that was broken brought us together


And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that would give you a diamond ring
When I fold, you see the best in me
The joker and the queen


I was upside down from the outside in
You came to the table and you went all in
With a single word and a gentle touch
You turned a moment into forever


And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that could give you a diamond ring
When I fold, you see the best in me
The joker and the queen



And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that would givе you a diamond ring
When I folded, you saw the bеst in me

52 Nina Lyrics
I met you when I was a teen but then you were one as well
And I could play a guitar just like ringing a bell
Sometimes, I wonder, in any other summer
Could you have been my part-time lover to me listening to Stevie Wonder?
Under the covers where we used to lay
And "Re: Stacks" is what the speakers played
I'd be on tour almost every day
When I was home, up in my flat is where we used to stay
Just watching a DVD, smoking illegal weed
Getting high as two kites when we needed to breathe
We used each other's air just for the people to see
And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep
We go anywhere our minds would take us
And I'll say you are beautiful without your make-up
And you don’t even need to worry 'bout your weight 'cause
We can all be loved the way that God made us
And time's the only reason that we could break up
'Cause you would always tell me I'm away too much
Distance is relative to the time that it takes
To get on a plane or make a mistake, so say it again


Oh, Nina
You should go, Nina
'Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now?
And I've been living on the road, Nina
But then again, you should know, Nina
'Cause that’s you and me both, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now, now?

And every weekend in the winter, you'd be wearing my hoodie
With drawstrings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold
Taking day trips to the local where we'd eat on our own
'Cause every day when I was away, we'd only speak on the phone
Watching Blue Planet, creating new habits
Acting as if we were two rabbits and then, you'd vanish
Back to the burrow with all the Celtics
I disappear, you call me selfish
I understand but I can’t help it
I put my job over everything 'cept my family and friends
But you'll be in between forever so I guess we'll have to take a step back
Overlook the situation
'Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications
And I'm not saying we should be taking a break
Just re-evaluate quick before we make a mistake and it’s too late
So we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on a plane
But in a day, we'll have to say it again


Oh, Nina
You should go, Nina
'Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now?
And I've been living on the road, Nina
But then again, you should know, Nina
'Cause that’s you and me both, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now, now?

Love will come and love will go
But you can't make it on your own
Sing that song, go
Oh, won't you leave me now?
People grow and fall apart
But you can't mend your broken heart
Take it back, go
Oh, won't you leave me now?


Oh, Nina
You should go, Nina
(Love will come and love will go)
'Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina
(But you can make it on your own)
Oh, won't you leave me now?
(Sing that song, go, oh, won't you leave me now?)
And I've been living on the road, Nina
(People grow and fall apart)
But then again, you should know, Nina
(But you can mend your broken heart)
'Cause that’s you and me both, Nina
(Take it back, go, oh, won't you leave me now?)
Oh, won't you leave me now, now?
Oh, Nina
You should go, Nina
(Love will come and love will go)
'Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina
(But you can make it on your own)
Oh, won't you leave me now?
(Sing that song, go, oh, won't you leave me now?)
And I've been living on the road, Nina

But then again, you should know, Nina

'Cause that’s you and me both, Nina

66 Wake Me Up Lyrics
I should ink my skin with your name
And take my passport out again and just replace it
See, I could do without a tan on my left hand
Where my fourth finger meets my knuckle
And I should run you a hot bath and fill it up with bubbles
'Cause maybe you're loveable
And maybe you're my snowflake
And your eyes turn from green to gray in the winter
I'll hold you in a cold place
And you should never cut your hair
'Cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder


And you will never know
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up


And would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me?
Could you make me a cup of tea to open my eyes in the right way?
And I know you love Shrek, 'cause we've watched it 12 times
But maybe you're hoping for a fairy-tale, too
And if your DVD breaks today, you should've got a VCR
'Cause I've never owned a Blu-ray, true say
And now I've always been shit at computer games
And your brother always beats me
And if I lost, I'd go across and chuck all the controllers at the TV
And then you'd laugh at me, and be asking me
If I'm gonna be home next week
And then you'd lie with me 'til I fall asleep
And flutter eye lash on my cheek between the sheets

And you will never know
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up


And I think you hate the smell of smoke
You always try and get me to stop
But you drink as much as me
And I get drunk a lot
So I’ll take you to the beach
And walk along the sand
And I'll make you a heart pendant
With a pebble held in my hand
And I'll carve it like a necklace
So the heart falls where your chest is
Now, a piece of me is a piece of the beach
And it falls just where it needs to be
And rests peacefully
So you just need to breathe to feel my heart against yours now
Against yours now


'Cause maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
Oh, maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
Maybe I fell in love when you woke me up30Embed
39 All of the Stars Lyrics
It's just another night, and I'm staring at the moon
I saw a shooting star and thought of you
I sang a lullaby by the waterside and knew
If you were here, I'd sing to you
You're on the other side, as the skyline splits in two
I'm miles away from seeing you
But I can see the stars from America
I wondered, do you see them too?


So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home


I can hear your heart on the radio beat
They're playing "Chasing Cars" and I thought of us
Back to the time you were lying next to me
I looked across and fell in love
So I took your hand back through lamp lit streets, I knew
Everything led back to you
So can you see the stars over Amsterdam?
You're the song my heart is beating to

So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home


And oh, I know
And oh, I know
And oh
I can see the stars
From America58Embed

Been inside for most this year
And I thought a few drinks, they might help
It's been a while, my dear
Dealin' with the cards life dealt
I'm still holdin' back these tears
While my friends are somewhere else


I pictured this year a little bit different when it hit February
I step in the bar, it hit me so hard, oh, how can it be this heavy?
Every song reminds me you're gone and I feel thе lump form in my throat
'Cause I'm here alonе

I can't help but missin' you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)


I pictured this month a little bit different, no one is ever ready

47 The Man Lyrics
Now, I don't wanna hate you
Just wish you'd never gone for the man
And waited two weeks, at least
Before you'd let him take you
I stayed true, kind of knew
You liked the dude from private school
He's waiting for the time to move
I knew he had his eyes on you
He's not the right guy for you
Don't hate me 'cause I write the truth
No, I would never lie to you
But it was never fine to lose you
And what a way to find out
It never came from my mouth
You never changed your mind
But you were just afraid to mind out
But **** it
I won't be changing the subject, I love it
I'll make your little secret public
It's nothing, I'm just disgusted with the skeletons
You sleep with in your closet to get back at me
Trapped and I'm lacking sleep
Fact is you're mad at me
Because I backtrack so casually
You're practically my family
If we married then I'll guess you'd have to be
But tragically, our love just lost the will to live
But would it kill to give it one more shot?
I think not

I don't love you, baby
I don't need you, baby
I don't want you, no
Anymore
I don't love you, baby
I don't need you, baby
I don't wanna love you, no
Anymore


Recently, I'll tend to zone out
Up in my headphones to Holocene
You promised your body but I'm away so much
I stay more celibate than in a monastery
I'm not cut out for life on the road
'Cause I didn't know I'd miss you this much
And at the time, we'd just go, so sue me
I guess I'm not the man that you need
Ever since you went to uni'
I've been sofa surfing with a rucksack
Full of less cash and I guess that could get bad
But when I broke the industry
That's when I broke your heart
I was supposed to chart and celebrate
But good things are over fast
I know it's hard to deal with and see this
I tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features
Then I turn the music off
And all I'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces, Jesus
I never really want to believe this
Got advice from my dad and he
Told me that family is all I'll ever have and need
I guess I'm unaware of it
Success is nothing if you have no one there left to share it with

I don't love you, baby
I don't need you, baby
I don't want you, no
Anymore
I don't love you, baby
I don't need you, baby
I don't wanna love you, no
Anymore


And since you left, I've given up my days off
It's what I need to stay strong
I know you have a day job but mine is 24/7
I feel like writing a book, I guess I lied in the hook
'Cause I still love you and I need you by my side if I could
The irony is if my career in music didn't exist
In 6 years, yeah, you'd probably be my wife with a kid
I'm frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink
And lighting a spliff, I fall into a spiral and it's
Just hiding my misguiding thoughts that I'm trying to kill
And I'll be writing my will before I'm 27, I'll die from a thrill
Go down in history as just a wasted talent
Can I face the challenge, or did I make a mistake erasing ****?
It's only therapy, my thoughts just get ahead of me
Eventually, I'll be fine, I know that it was never meant to be
Either way, I guess I'm not prepared, but I'll say this
These things happen for a reason and you can't change ****
Take my apology, I'm sorry for the honesty
But I had to get this off my chest

I don't love you, baby
I don't need you, baby
I don't want you, no
Anymore
I don't love you, baby
I don't need you, baby
I don't wanna love you, no

57 TranslationsEspañolPortuguêsDeutschفارسیOverpass Graffiti Lyrics
This is a dark parade
Another rough patch to rain on
To rain on
I know your friends may say
This is a cause for celebration
Hip, hip, hooray, love


Photographs in sepia tones
So still, the fire's barely fighting the cold
Alone
There are times when I can feel your ghost
Just when I'm almost letting you go
The cards were stacked against us both


I will always love you for what it's worth
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass
And I know time may change the way you think of us
But I'll remember the way we were
You were the first full-stop love that will never leave
Baby, you will never be lost on me


This is a goddamn shame
I never wanted to break it
Leave us tainted
Know I should walk away
But I just can't replace us
Or even erase us

The car was stuck, the engine stalled
And both of us got caught out in the snow
Alone
There were times when I forget the lows
And think the highs were all that we'd ever known
The cards were stacked against us both


I will always love you for what it's worth
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass
And I know time may change the way you think of us
But I'll remember the way we were
You were the first full-stop love that will never leave
Baby, you will never be lost on me


Lost on me
Baby, you will never be lost on me
Lost on me


Well, I will always love you for what it's worth
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass, yeah
And I know time may change the way you think of us
But I'll remember the way we were
You were the first full-stop love that will never leave
Baby, you will never be lost on me

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Lost on me

57 TranslationsFrançaisDrunk Lyrics
I wanna be drunk when I wake up
On the right side of the wrong bed
And never an excuse I made up
Tell you the truth I hate
What didn't kill me, it never made me stronger at all
Love will scar your makeup lip sticks to me
So now, I'll maybe lean back there
I'm sat here, wishing I was sober
I know I'll never hold you like I used to


But our house gets cold when you cut the heating
Without you to hold, I'll be freezing
Can't rely on my heart to beat it
'Cause you take part of it every evening
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing
Replace with phrases like, "When you leaving me?"
Should I? Should I?


Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love

I wanna hold your heart in both hands
Not watch you fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can
And I've got no plans for the weekend
So should we speak then? Keep it between friends?
Though I know you'll never love me like you used to
There may be other people like us
Will see the flicker of the clipper when they light up
Flames just create us, burns don't heal like before
You don't hold me anymore


On cold days, cold plays out like the band's name
I know I can't heal things with a handshake
You know I can't change, as I began saying
You cut me wide open like a landscape
Open bottles of beer but never champagne
To applaud you with the sound that my hands make
Should I? Should I?


Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love

All by myself
I'm here again
All by myself
You know I'll never change
All by myself
All by myself


I'm just drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again

It's such a beautiful night to make a change in our lives
East Anglian sky, empty bottle of wine
I got you by my side, talkin' 'bout love and life
Oh, how lucky am I when I look in your eyes?
What a wonderful way to spend a moment or two
To be lyin' awake, and be here talkin' to you
I got somethin' to say, I know what I gotta do
To be makin' a change, now the moment of truth


Why am I feelin' so nervous when
Things are goin' so perfect? And
But I know that it's worth it to
Spend forever with you


And so I count to three and get on one knee
And I ask you
Darlin', honestly
I've waited all this time just to make it right
So I'll ask you (Tonight)
Will you marry me? Just say yes
One word, one love, one life


A gentle touch of the hand, fingers runnin' through hair
Lips pressed to my lips, oh, I was caught unaware
Arms holdin' me tight, tears in both of our eyes
What a beautiful way to spend the rest of our lives
Sun will reappear, burnin' auburn and red
My chest was the pillow, green grass lawn was the bed
Last night was the night, one last moment of truth
And what a wonderful way to fall in deeper in you

Why was I feelin' nervous when
Things were goin' so perfect? And
Well, now I know that it's worth it to
Spend forever with you


And so I count to three and get on one knee
And I ask you
Darlin', honestly
I've waited all this time just to make it right
So I'll ask you (Tonight)
Will you marry me? Just say yes
One word, one love, one life


(Your hand in mine) Some things were just meant to be
(Hearts intertwined) Some things were just meant to be
(In perfect time) Some things were just meant to be
(Oh, you and I) Some things were just meant to be
(Your hand in mine) Some things were just meant to be
(Hearts intertwined) Some things were just meant to be
(In perfect time) Some things were just meant to be
(Oh, you and I) Some things were just meant to be1Embed
36 TranslationsPortuguêsRunaway Lyrics
I've known it for a long time
Daddy wakes up to a drink at nine
Disappearing all night
I don't wanna know where he's been lying
I know what I wanna do
Wanna runaway, runaway with you
Gonna grab clothes, six in the morning, go


"How long you leaving?"
Well, Dad, just don't expect me back this evening
Oh, it could take a bit of time to heal this
It's been a long day, thumb on side of the roadway, but


I love him from my skin to my bones
But I don't wanna live in his home
There's nothing to say 'cause he knows
I'll just run away and be on my own


I've never seen my dad cry
Cold as stone in the kitchen light
I'll tell you it's about time
But I was raised to keep quiet
This is what I'm gonna do
Gonna run away, gonna make that move
Gonna grab clothes and when it's morning, go

"How long you leaving?"
Well, Dad, just don't expect me back this evening
Oh, it could take a bit of time to heal this
It's been a long day, thumb on side of the roadway, but


I love him from my skin to my bones
But I don't wanna live in his home
There's nothing to say 'cause he knows
I'll just run away and be on my own


Backpack and a flat cap turned to the back
As I packed my clothes up
My dad wasn't down with that plan to attack
Intends to show love
I don’t wanna live this way
Gonna take my things and go
If things change in a matter of days
I could be persuaded to hold on
Mama was the same
None of us are saints, I guess that God knows that
I don't wanna run away
And one of these days, I might just show that
Put my home in a suitcase
Tie both shoe laces, and hope that
Things change, but for now, I'll leave town
With a backpack on my shoulder

I love him from my skin to my bones
But I don't wanna live in his home
There’s nothing to say 'cause he knows
I'll just run away and be on my own50Embed

I had a bad week
Spent the evening pretending it wasn't that deep
You could see in my eyes that it was taking over
I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment
You know you take all of my stress right down
Help me get it off my chest and out
Into the ether with the rest of this mess that just keeps us depressed
We forget that we're here right now


'Cause we're livin' life at a different pace
Stuck in a constant race
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break
Something's gotta change
We should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn
If we're missin' out on what the people think is right
Seein' through a picture behind the screen and forget to be
Lose the conversation for the message that you'll never read
I think maybe you and me
Oh, we should head out to the place where the music plays
And then


We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone, then loved
And all we need is us to go all

Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us


What do you reckon, is it just me?
Words are weapons and occasionally they cut deep
Crisis of confidence, it tends to come when I feel the dark and I open my heart
If you don't see it, you should trust me
I feel like I got nothin' left right now
Except this beauty in her dress right now
She got me feelin' like the best, and the rest are just less than she needs
So we press play and step to the beat


'Cause we're livin' life at a different pace
Stuck in a constant race
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break
Something's gotta change
We should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn
Head out to the place where it plays and


We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone and loved
And all we need is us to go all

Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us to go all night
Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us to go all night14Embed
32 The Parting Glass Lyrics
Of all the money that e'er I had
I spent it in good company
And all the harm that e'er I've done
Alas, it was to none but me
And all I've done for want of wit
To memory now, I can't recall
So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all


Of all the comrades that e'er I had
They are sorry for my going away
And all the sweethearts that e'er I had
They would wish me one more day to stay
But since it falls unto my lot
That I should rise and you should not
I'll gently rise and I'll softly call
Good night and joy be with you all


A man may drink and not be drunk
A man may fight and not be slain
A man may court a pretty girl
And, perhaps, be welcomed back again
But since it has so ought to be
By a time to rise and a time to fall
Come fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all
Good night and joy be with you all15Embed
58 Nothing on You Lyrics
I feel it, can you feel it tonight?
I feel the fire between you and I
I mean it, don't you turn off the light
Though I don't wanna leave you ever, no
She was like "Damn¨
Boy, I never took you for a one night stand
So don't make plans
For nothing but me and a lil' romance," hey
You and I, whiskey on ice
Maybe later we can turn down all the lights
So keep 'em on with nothing on
Ooh-my-my-my


I was rolling up something with you
Kickin' back in a way that we do
I got everything I need in this room
Smoke clouds and a scent of perfume
And all my friends are in the club
And they keep ringin' my phone (Prr)
But they ain't got nothing on you (Ah, ah)
And you ain't got nothing on you (Leones Con Flow)


Mami, suelo acobardarme pero hoy tomo alcohol, ah
Quiero comentarle que no sé qué pasó, ah
Desde que salimo' por la tarde lo' do'
A besarno' lo' do', hasta hacer el amor
Ahora tengo tu olor, ven a la habitación
Lo que hacemo' lo' do' no se puede igualar
Parecemo' ficción cuando entramo' en acción
Esta peli de amor no se puede acabar, yeh (Yo'; ¡wuf!)
Pero lo que mata e' que esta noche no' vemo' ya en mi casa (Ey; wuh)
Y sé lo que te gusta y te atrapa
Que te diga que no te voy a soltar

I was rolling up something with you (¡Wuh!)
Kickin' back in a way that we do
I got everything I need in this room
Smoke clouds and a scent of perfume
And all my friends are in the club
And they keep ringin' my phone (Prr)
But they ain't got nothing on you
And you ain't got nothing on you


Look, take the lead, follow me, what's it gonna be?
How you playin' hard to get when you hollered me?
I take Chanel to Chanel for a shopping spree
Home girl, only right she in a proper tee
What I want and need, you and a sofa
I fly in a spaceship, I gotta land the Rover
Casa Cruz, Casa Blanca, Casanova
I'm a fashionista, she in Fashion Nova
And a mad persona when I had her over
The outfit, it cost bread, I got the matching loafers
Why? 'Cause that's suttin' to do
I got a million and two but they're nothin' on you, nah


I was rolling up something with you
Kickin' back in a way that we do
I got everything I need in this room
Smoke clouds and a scent of perfume
And all my friends are in the club
And they keep ringin' my phone (Brrt)
But they ain't got nothing on you
And you ain't got nothing on you

She was like "Damn¨
Boy, I never took you for a one night stand"
She was like "Damn¨
Boy, I never took you for a one night stand"
Want to be your man
"Boy, I never took you for a one night stand"
She was like "Damn¨
And you ain't got nothing on you10Embed
32 Even My Dad Does Sometimes Lyrics
It's alright to cry
Even my dad does sometimes
So don't wipe your eyes
Tears remind you you're alive
It's alright to die
'Cause death's the only thing you haven't tried
But just for tonight, hold on


So live life like you're giving up
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart


It's alright to shake
Even my hand does sometimes
So inside, we'll rage
Against the dying of the light
It's alright to say that death's the only thing you haven't tried
But just for today, hold on


So live life like you’re giving up
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart, and hold on
Live life like you're giving up
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart, and hold on25Embed
26 Make It Rain Lyrics
When the sins of my father
Weigh down in my soul
And the pain of my mother
Will not let me go
Well, I know there can come fire from the sky
To refine the purest of kings
And even though I know this fire brings me pain
Even so, and just the same


Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Make it rain
Make it rain


Well, a seed needs the water
'Fore it grows out of the ground
But it just keeps on getting hard
Hunger more profound
Well, I know they can't count tears from the eye
But they may as well all be in vain
And even though I know these tears come with pain
Even so, and just the same

Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Just make it rain
Make it rain


Well, the seas are full of water
Stops by the shore
It's like the riches of grandeur, oh no
Never reach the poor
And let the clouds fill with thunderous applause
And let lightning be the veins
But fill the sky with all that they can draw
When it's time to make a change


Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain

34 Put It All on Me Lyrics
Ooh, I can't wait to get home
I don't know why, but I'm feelin' low
Happened again and I want you to know
Having my woman there is good for my soul


I try to be strong, well, I got demons
So can I lean on you?
I need a strong heart and a soft touch
And you're the one when I want love


It's you and only you who can be takin' away
The shit that I go through each and every day
When I'm alone with you, you make it better again, yeah
Your arms are where I wanna remain
Catch my eye, and she starts to say


Hey, baby, we can dance slowly
My darlin', I'll be all you need, you need
I know it hasn't been your day or week, or week, or week
So put it all on me
Oh, my darlin', put your worries on me
Can't judge you 'cause I feel the same thing
And I'm here for whenever you need, you need, you need
To put it all on me

Love, on me, o-o-on me
Hey baby, we can dance slowly
Love, on me, o-o-on me
Put your, put your, put your worries on me
Love, on me, o-o-on me
Hey baby, we can dance slowly
And I'm here for whenever you need
To put it all on me


Ooh, you're there for me when I
Need you to be, 'cause I
Find it hard to say the words
But some shit don't need an explanation, baby


I try to be strong, but I got demons
So can I lean on you?
I need a strong heart and a soft touch
And you're the one when I want love


It's you and only you that can be takin' away
The shit that I go through each and every day
Baby, I can't wait, in love with all your ways
Your arms are where I wanna remain
Grab my waist when I start to say, now

Hey, baby, we can dance slowly (Hey)
My, darlin', I'll be all you need, you need (Oh)
I know it hasn't been your day or week, or week, or week
So put it all on me
Oh, my darlin', put your worries on me
Can't judge you 'cause I feel the same thing
And I'm here for whenever you need, you need, you need
To put it all on me (Babe)


Love, on me, o-o-on me (On me)
Hey baby, we can dance slowly (Slow)
Love, on me, o-o-on me
Put your, put your, put your worries on me
Love, on me, o-o-on me (On me)
Hey, baby, we can dance slowly
And I'm here for whatever you need (Need)
So put it all on me

38 TranslationsPortuguêsItalianoDeutschفارسیFirst Times Lyrics
I thought it'd feel different playin' Wembley
Eighty thousand singin' with me
It's what I've been chasin' 'cause this is the dream
When it was all over, I cleared out the room
Grabbed a couple beers, just me and you
Then we started talking the way that we do


Ain't it funny how the simplest things in life can make a man?
Little moments that pass us by
Oh, but I remember


The first kiss, the first night, the first song that made you cry
The first drink, red wine, on a step in Brooklyn
I still feel the first fight, and we both made it out alive
And I can't wait to make a million more first times
Mmm, mmm


The greatest thing that I have achieved
Was four little words, down on one knee
You said, "Darling, are you jokin'?", and I just said, "Please"


Ain't it funny how the simplest things in life can make a man?
Little moments that pass us by
Oh, but I remember

The first kiss, the first night, the first song that made you cry
The first look in your eyes when I said "I love you"
I can still feel the butterflies from when we stumbled home that night
I can't wait to make a million more first times
Mmm, mmm


Ain't it funny how the simplest things in life can make a man?
Little moments that pass us by
Oh, but I remember


The first kiss, first night, first song that made you cry
First dance in moonlight in your parents' garden
I can't wait to see everything that's yet to be
Our first child and then a million more first times11Embed
48 Little Lady Lyrics
Listen, little lady
This is just the worst way to spend your birthday, it's 30 degrees, Thursday
You work late, you was with a perv making dirty fake love in his Mercedes
Lady, the word "rape" sums up events that take place every night
You wanna get up but you know your legs will ache if you try
And you remember that your punter went crazy last night
You drag yourself to the mirror to check your face then you cry
Forget the visit to the clinic you were booked in for
You'll make a trip to the Whittington where they'll look at your jaw
They'll be inquisitive and ask about your business for sure
They'll know you're fibbing if you tell them you got hit by a door
But young woman, the pimp sees you as nothing but a dumb hooker
Medical attention could be fatal cause the cunt wouldn't
Ever let a doctor near someone that's getting dough for him
Cause next you got poxy authorities sticking their noses in


She's just under the upper hand
And goes mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside, tonight
'Cause, in a pipe, she'll fly to the motherland
And sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
For angels to fly

Little lady, your mind you've made up
Your injuries you can't hide with make-up
You need some medical advice, you make up a little lie to say just
In case the doc opens his eyes and don't decide to play dumb
With any luck you'll see the same dude who stitched your top lip
Last year when your pimp just lost it
He wouldn't recognise you if you stared him in the face anyway
'Cause all the heroin is making you age
But you're a heroine for taking the strain of being a prostitute and punching bag
The funds you have left go where your from using MoneyGram
Mother had to get you out the motherland to study
That was all she struggled to have a single daughter with the upper hand
Little does she know you're never coming back
She put you in her brother's hands, only for him to formulate another plan
He's the fucking cause of your appalling state, this summer
Fancy that, you came to London to get pimped by your uncle, damn


She's just under the upper hand
And goes mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside, tonight
'Cause, in a pipe, she'll fly to the motherland
And sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly

Now an angel will die, covered in white
With closed eyes and hoping for a better life
This time now, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line


Little lady, you're trembling with fear
Your skinny frame kinda resembles a deer
You're sitting facing the detective, oh, dear
The meddling nurse couldn't just leave it
She's only gone and made it much worse calling police in
She'll never know the gravity of the damage she's caused
You're causing scandal going mad in the ward now
The cop is trying to calm you, telling you he won't let no one harm you
The same question he keeps trying to ask you, "Who you working for?"
He's talking to you like you're worth more than a dirty whore
You're having a conversation you could be murdered for
You're learning more about exactly why you need to help bring him or her to court
He's kicking knowledge you ain't ever heard before
Just before he leaves, he reassures you that he knows that it's hard
He underlines a mobile number you can phone on his card
Begs you to use it, he's useless if you're gonna be stupid
'Cause an answer hasn't come from your bruised lips, you're on your own
You've gotta go and give your pimp what you owe
You reach your door and then it dawns that you've been followed home
Before you turn around you feel a cold blade on your throat
And then a voice says, "Where you been, bitch? I wanna know"
No prizes for guessing who it is, resistance would be foolishness
You open the front door, he boots you in
There's something new in him, he's silent now, that fills you with terror
Get your alibi straight, you could be killed for an error
He towers over you, the six-inch knife catches the sunlight
At this point, your life flashes before your eyes
Your handbag's dropped and all the contents are all over the floor
Despite the mess there's only one thing that has caught his eye
And in the moment of rage, he brutally murders his niece
And dumps her body in the boot of his Mercs in the street
Little lady left this earth in the worst way
All because she got a card on her thirteenth birthday

And we're all under the upper hand
And going mad for a couple grams
And we don't wanna go outside, tonight
'Cause, in a pipe, she'll fly to the motherland
And sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
For angels to fly
And fly, fly
For angels to fly
To fly, to fly
And angels to die17Embed
18 Nando’s Skank Lyrics
I said, oi, you, are you gonna bang doe?
No, I want some fucking Nando's
Wanna eat up with chicken and chips
Everyone knows I freestyle like this
When I freestyle on the beat about chicken
You know it's finger lickin'
And now I'm gonna pass it over to Example now
He's gonna freestyle and he's gonna show you how


Chicken, chicken wings
They're my favourite things and I love to sing
I say chicken, chicken wings
If you give me them I will eat them tings


Yo, and we eat chicken for free
Cause he's got a black card you see
He made a song about chicken from Nando's
And are you gonna bang yo?
Yes please I want some chicken right now
Please I want to put it in my stomach yes
It tastes so good I wanna eat the chicken
With the fucking breasts and the wings
And the thighs and the chips and the...

And all them things that are nice

Nando's from me, fat chance I gotta black card
If you come to me and ask for chicken you'll get a fat scar
In your left cheek I eat Nando's every week
Sometime on a Tuesday, sometime on a Thursday (yo)
I get free drinks, refillable even when I'm thirsty
On a Thursday I eat chicken in the worst ways


Yeah, I said we are on tour, saw him
I'm like get out the store, yo!
Cause you are a whore
Eat Nando's for free everyday on tour, yo!
And it's a par, I ate Nando's from your car
Can't freestyle cause you'll see me starve
I slap you in the face cause like I'm like Febreeze ya!


Chicken on the phone
Chicken on the phone
Chicken on the phone
Chicken on the phone
Chicken on the phone
I eat chicken off the floor
I eat chicken off the bone
Chicken on the phone
Chicken on the phone
Chicken on the phone
Chicken on the phone
Chicken off the floor
Chicken off the sky
Chicken off the bone
I eat chicken off the bone

I love Nando's more than your mum does
More than your mum does
Nando's (I say oh)
I love Nando's
My tongue is on fire
I wanna say Elliot (yes Ed?)
Nando's I desire (I'll give it to you anytime you want babe)
I want some free Nando's from your black card


You ain't getting in my wallet
Ain't getting in my wallet
I'm on it, I'm on it (I wanna take your black card)
You ain't getting my wallet


Cause I need them pounds every time I go there to eat my food
And you're so fucking rude you don't fucking buy it for me
So I want Nandos for free
And you look like you put your fingers in electricity sockets
To get your hair up like this


You're never touching my card, this is my card
You're never touching my card, this is my card
You come to me, play your guitar
Step to me hard, you ain't getting my card star

I want some Nando's
I want some Nando's
I want some Nando's (right now)
I want some Nando's right now3Embed
25 Autumn Leaves Lyrics
Another day, another life
Passes by just like mine
It's not complicated
Another mind, another soul
Another body to grow old
It's not complicated


Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you?
Float down, like autumn leaves
Hush now, close your eyes before the sleep
And you're miles away
And yesterday you were here with me


Another tear, another cry
Another place for us to die
It's not complicated
Another life that's gone to waste
Another light lost from your face
It's complicated


Is it that it's over or do birds still sing for you?
Float down, like autumn leaves
Hush now, close your eyes before the sleep
And you're miles away
And yesterday you were here with me

Ooh how I miss you
My symphony played the song that carried you out
Ooh how I miss you
I miss you and I wish you'd stay


Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you?
Float down, like autumn leaves
Hush now, close your eyes before the sleep
And you're miles away
And yesterday you were here with me


Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you?
Float down, like autumn leaves
Hush now, close your eyes before the sleep
And you're miles away
And yesterday you were here with me


Touch down
Like a seven four seven
We'll stay out and we'll live forever now...23Embed
37 Eraser (Extended F64 Version) Lyrics
I was born inside a small town, I've lost that state of mind
Learned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped at the age of nine
I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride
The paving stones I played upon, that kept me on the grind
So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life
Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride
And when the world's against me is when I really come alive
And every day that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride
You know that I've got whisky with white lines, and smoke in my lungs
I think life has got to the point I know without it's no fun
I need to get in the right mind and clear myself up
Instead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become
I guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me
Without a nine-to-five job or a uni degree
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry
They showed me the locked doors I find another use of key
And you'll see


I'm well aware of certain things that will destroy a man like me
But with that said give me one more, higher
Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain
Eraser

I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs
I chased the picture perfect life, I think they painted it wrong
I think that money is the root of all evil and fame is hell
Relationships and hearts you fixed, they break as well
And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps
Because you're living your dream, man, this shit should be fun
Please know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm Reverend Run
I beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become
Our conversations with my father on the A14
Age twelve telling me I've gotta chase those dreams
Now I'm playing for the people, Dad, and they know me
With my beat and small guitar wearing the same old jeans
Wembley Stadium crowd two hundred and forty thou
I may have grown up but I hope that Damien's proud
And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed
The world may be filled with hate but keep erasing it now
Somehow


I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me
But with that said give me one more, higher
Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain
Eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain
Eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain
Eraser

I woke up this morning lookin' in the mirror
Thinkin' to myself that I should probably be thinner
The industry told me to look like them
But I found my happiness in fried food for my dinner
I wish that she could have been my first time
And I wish that I'd never took that first line
And I wish that every word in this verse rhymed
But forgive me if it doesn't
I wish that I could make peace with my older cousin
I wish he didn't think that it was me when it wasn't
I wish I didn't love it when I'm high and my face feels buzzin'
And the taste stays underneath my tongue, and
Wish that I had known what to do as a youngen
Wish I hadn't dropped out of school and missed every single party
With that hardly matters now, man, does it?
Wish I had an answer to everything, but fuck it
I wish creatin' art didn't come with a budget
But while we're on the subject
I wish my private life would have never gone public
But that's the sacrifice that we make
Spendin' my whole time high livin' life away


I'm singin' this is how we're livin' down here
Sittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear
Yeah, we got drama but you know we don't care
I wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish
I'm singin' this is how we're livin' down here
Sittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear
Yeah, we got drama but you know we don't care
I wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish

I wish my family and friends, they stay healthy
I wish that love was a currency and the whole world was wealthy
I found myself late night wishin' on a star
Everyday I wish I'd never broken a heart, uh
And I wish I'd never run through
Every woman that I loved that kept my life and what it's come to
I wish I was the role model you looked up to
If I told my fans the things I did they'd say, "Fuck you"
I wish I was home more
I wish my team could see their kids on their birthdays, but yo, we're on tour
And I wish I'd grown more, wish I told more
People that I love 'em but it's in the music that I'm known for
And I wish he never got cancer
And if I smoke a pack a day, well, does that make me a wanker?
Oh yes, I guess it does, and we're still stressing 'cause
Every day this cocaine gets the best of us
Usin' my balance on razor blades
Spendin' my whole time high wishing life would wait


I'm singin' this is how we're livin' down here
Sittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear
Yeah, we got drama but you know we don't care
I wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish
I'm singin' this is how we're livin' down here
Sittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear
Yeah, we got drama but you know we don't care
I wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish


I'm using jumpers for goalposts, cigarettes for throat coat
Mum sayin', "Don't smoke," no, I don't listen, I got
Love for a ghost note, shows on the gold coast
People that I don't know share the same vision
I find truth in the hard times and words that aren't mine
Tryin' to find a love with a compatible star sign
Sometimes I can't write, sentences can't rhyme
Starin' at my notepad quick, I'm tryin' to find mine
Shit quick before I hit it again
Surrounded in the industry by all these ignorant men
And who knew that I'd be paid just to pick up a pen
Just let me hit the studio when we can rip it again
I'm a competitive dick with an adrenaline kick
My daddy told me, "Work hard and you can never be shit"
I've seen all my heroes dethroned except my dad
Set back here reminiscing 'bout the times we had

11 Hands of Gold (Game of Thrones) Lyrics
He rode through the streets of the city
Down from his hill on high
O'er the wynds and the steps and the cobble
He rode to a woman's sigh
For she was his secret treasure
She was his shame and his bliss
And a chain and a keep are nothing
Compared to a woman's kiss


For hands of gold are always cold
But a woman's hands are warm
For hands of gold are always cold
But a woman's hands are ...6Embed
42 Friends Lyrics
We're not, no we're not friends, nor have we ever been
We just try to keep those secrets in our lives
And if they find out, will it all go wrong?
And heaven knows, no one wants it to


So I could take the back road
But your eyes'll lead me straight back home
And if you know me like I know you
You should love me, you should know


Friends just sleep in another bed
And friends don't treat me like you do
Well I know that there's a limit to everything
But my friends won't love me like you
No, my friends won't love me like you


We're not friends, we could be anything
If we tried to keep those secrets safe
No one will find out if it all went wrong
They'll never know what we've been through


So I could take the back road
But your eyes'll lead me straight back home
And if you know me like I know you
You should love me, you should know

Friends just sleep in another bed
And friends don't treat me like you do
Well I know that there's a limit to everything
But my friends won't love me like you
No, my friends won't love me like you


But then again, if we're not friends
Someone else might love you too
And then again, if we're not friends
There'd be nothing I could do, and that's why


Friends should sleep in other beds
And friends shouldn't kiss me like you do
And I know that there's a limit to everything
But my friends won't love me like you
No, my friends won't love me like you do
Oh, my friends will never love me like you27Embed
42 TranslationsEspañolPortuguêsDeutschفارسیTides Lyrics
I have grown up, I am a father now
Everything has changed, but I am still the same somehow
You know I've never been afraid of death
But now I wanna see the things that haven't happened yet
I still love getting out of my mind, I should cut it down
I still know people I don't like and I should cut them out
I feel embarrassed 'bout the things that I did in my youth
'Cause now, I have a child, I know one day that she'll go through it


Freight cargo, dot stops, and aeroplanes
Late-night calls, signal is in and out again
Feelin' low on serotonin and better days
Go, go, go, but every moment you're here with mе


Time stops to still
When you are in my arms, it always will
And lifе, life is changin' tides


I lost the confidence in who I was
Too busy tryna chase the high and get the numbers up
I have the same dream every night
A bullet through my brain the moment that I close my eyes
I still have to lean on a shoulder when I've broken down
And I have people that depend on me to sort them out
I sometimes fantasise I disappear without a trace
I've no regrets, but wish I did things in a different way

Low fly zone, lawsuits, and film stars
Headline wrote, "Princess and the face scar"
Broken bones, break-ins, and Babylon
Go, go, go, but every moment you're here with me


Time stops to still
When you are in my arms, it always will
And life, life is changin' tides
Time stops to still
When you are in my arms, it always will
And life, life is changin' tides8Embed
63 1000 Nights Lyrics
Oh, I been on for a thousand nights
New York to London, different city every day, yeah
Playin' on, playin' on, puttin' up 50 thousand lights
Oh, I've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' faded
So I'm on, keepin' on, stayin' up for a thousand nights


This the type of shit we used to dream of (Yeah, yeah)
Bad bitch look like Mona Lisa (Mona Lisa)
Flippin' off a yacht in Ibiza (Splash, water)
Clear port, hasta la vista
Do it all again when we touchdown, everything bust down
Teacher said I would lose, I be like, "What now?"
I started makin' moves, they showin' me love now
Lit like a light bulb 'cause, bitch, I'm the plug now
And now you know we poppin', we bubble like soda poppin'
I see it, I like it, I wake up, pull up, and go and cop it
The millions get wired, them Benny hunnids still go in pocket
I party with Ed Sheeran, my homies still hold a rocket
'Cause I'm so hood, it don't make no sense
Still remember the times I couldn't pay my rent
Now, I walk in a stadiums, tell 'em, "Play my shit"
And they gon' sing like this


Oh, I been on for a thousand nights
New York to London, different city every day, yeah
Playin' on, playin' on, puttin' up 50 thousand lights
Oh, I've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' faded
So I'm on, keepin' on, stayin' up for a thousand nights

Last night, I played a show at a stadium in Atlanta
Husband and wives, daddies and daughters with the cameras
I never thought it would get this big, but why does it matter?
Everything is already part of a plan
I remember, damn, me and my man inside of this Splitter van
200 a night, end of 2010
Stayin' up in every city's Holiday Inn
If it wasn't there, then I was at the couch of a friend's
Wetherspoon's was an easy option to get a cheaper lunch and
£2 pint, the waitress maybe leave her number
On to the next town, but now it's to the next continent (Woo)
And I don't think it's gonna be stoppin' anytime soon
Birds eye view, pay my dues for a two-mile queue
Don't need to read reviews if you can't do the things I do
Oh, let me invite you to my world


Oh, I been on for a thousand nights
New York to London, different city every day, yeah
Playin' on, playin' on, puttin' up 50 thousand lights
Oh, I've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' faded (Gettin' faded)
So I'm on, keepin' on, stayin' up for a thousand nights


Mmm, I'm so faded, yeah
I don't even know how much I made this year
I'm so used to bein' on some player shit
Cheated on my girlfriend with a famous bitch
Hoodie on pull up, just like the Reaper, yeah
I do this on the regular, make you seem unfair
St. Laurent, Gucci sweater, the red and green Moncler
Me and Meek and Ed Sheeran just like the Beatles, yeah
From her head to her toe, she know she be flee, oh yeah
Everyday, I be seein' her and Ceiline, oh yeah
She wanna come closer, but I don't see us there
I'm not a regular person, I be low-key, oh yeah
From New York out to London
She was, she was with me all the time
And I've been on the road, so long she couldn't call my line
And now she got her ass and titties done for a thousand likes

Oh, I been on for a thousand nights
New York to London, different city every day, yeah
Playin' on, playin' on, puttin' up 50 thousand lights
Oh, I've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' faded
So I'm on, keepin' on, stayin' up for a thousand nights7Embed
48 Translations日本語Celestial Lyrics
You see tonight, it could go either way
Hearts balanced on a razor blade
We are designed to love and break
And to rinse and repeat it all again


I get stuck when the world's too loud
And things don't look up when you're goin' down
I know your arms are reachin' out
From somewhere beyond the clouds


You make me feel
Like my troubled heart is a million miles away
You make me feel
Like I'm drunk on stars and we're dancing out in the space
Celestial
Celеstial


I see the light shining through the rain
A thousand colours in a brighter shadе
Needed to rise from the lowest place
There's silver lining that surrounds the grey

When I get lost, will you come back around?
Things don't look up when you're goin' down
I know your arms, they are reachin' out
From somewhere beyond the clouds


You make me feel
Like my troubled heart is a million miles away
You make me feel
Like I'm drunk on stars and we're dancing out in the space

Celestial, oh


We were made to be nothin' more than this
Findin' magic in all the smallest things
The way we notice, that's what really matters
Let's make tonight go on and on and on

Findin' magic in all the smallest things
(You make me feel) The way we notice, that's what really matters
Let's make tonight go on and on and on

39 Way to Break My Heart Lyrics
Star sign, Gemini
Brown eyes, fair hair in the light
We called time last night
And I can't stop thinkin’ 'bout her


And her lips upon mine
So soft, feelings I don't know the name of
Under the clothes we take off
Used to be two hearts in love


Oh, why, oh why am I alone?
Did I, did I do something wrong?
Am I the reason, or have you found someone else?
So tell me, girl


How can I live without love?
How can I be what you want?
’Cause when the morning comes around
You're still gone and I'll say
How can I see through the dark?
All I can do is wonder where you are
Are you happy in someone else's arms?
Well, that's the way to break my

Heart
That's the way to break my heart
That's the way to break my heart
That's the way to break my heart
That’s the way to break my—


First love never dies
Guess I’ll see you in another life
12 years down the line
There's just one thing I remember


Her lips upon mine
So soft, feelings I don’t know the name of
Under the clothes we take off
Used to be two hearts in love


Oh, why, oh why am I alone?
Did I, did I do something wrong?
Am I the reason, or have you found someone else?
So tell me, girl


How can I live without love?
How can I be what you want?
'Cause when the morning comes around
You're still gone and I'll say
How can I see through the dark?
All I can do is wonder where you are
Are you happy in someone else’s arms?
Well, that's the way to break my

31 Bad Habits (Fumez the Engineer Remix) Lyrics
Ooh


Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful
(Grr, mm-mm, yeah)


Feds havin' nightmares when I got my ice
Gyal up on my left side, gyal up on my right (Mm-mm)
Six figure transfer when I cop my ride (Baow, baow, baow)
That's why the opps them just wanna take my life
Before the music, had to put a shift in (Damn)
Made Lambo money from a Citröen (Boom)
I was tapped then, rolling with my kitchen
That's why they want me just lock up in thе system
Bad habits in my life, in my veins (In my vеins)
Bad habits in the nine with a babe (Boom)
Bad habits, can't end up with a case
Man, them bad vibes just haffi go away
'Cause I was broke, getting Ps weren't easy (Easy)
I'm with Sheeran now, it's cheeky (Mad)
Feds can't believe I'm on TV
They're havin' flashbacks of CCTV
Tough luck (Ooh), he got brucked up (Ooh)
In my drop-top (Ooh), getting top-top (Boom)
And my young buck, if he catch an opp-opp
No Double-E ting, bidda-bop-bop (Boom)
But fuck what you're tellin' 'em (Buh), I'm from Edmonton (Buh)
Bad vibes everyting ****
Rolex or I might bust it on skeleton (Buh, buh, buh)
(My bad habits lead to you)

I don't wanna go on a mad one
Them say somethin' I can't come back from
Frontways, sideways, cowgirl, backshots
Mr. Miyagi, wax off, wax on
I don't even smoke, she want a backstrap one
Messed up with my good girl and a sad one
Now I'm in a hotel room with a bad one
Strapped up, I don't wanna give mum a grandson
These ladies moving crazy, uh
Wanna have babies by me
Lately I've been keepin' my head down
Ain't been wildin', takin' time out
Cards laid out, got nothin' to hide 'bout
Ayy, maybe I slipped up once on a night out
If she find out 'bout that, she wild out
The sex feel better when you make up
After you break up, all body language
Don't wanna say much
We could go back to the AP and lay up
Or fuck in the back of the Bentley Bentayga
Come home late, she wake, she stayin' up
Body intact, no personal trainer
Breakfast in bed, don't cook me no bacon
I just want head when I wake up

I got gyal up in Chelsea, you know
But why everyone there when you blow?
The feds tryna get help with the roads
Me nuh know, me nuh know, me nuh know
I got gyal everywhere in the globe
But everyone disappears when you're broke
If bro calls me and say it's that time, I don't care
I'm putting my career on hold


Bad night if we back out the pumpy (Grr)
Bad sight when me keep up the fuckery (Baow)
If I bang him in the face, can't stop me (Mm-mm)
Bad time, but today I'm lucky
Yo, in the rave with the gauge (Baow)
Bad habits, can't end up in a cage (Boom)
Bang at anyone, straight in the face (Baow, baow, mm-mm)
She left me on read back then when I had no bread
Like shorty didn't trust the process
Free all the guys locked down four walls
When I think 'bout that, I get claustrophobic
Pure cocaine, no bakin' soda
Lot of ammonia, I don't condone it
But you gotta do what you gotta do
When you're stuck in the hood just hopin'
I-I-I was lickin' 'em, stickin' them, left as an artist
Dylan just fill up and empty the cartridge
Do it like Sheringham, shoot up the rahted
Think I won't pull up and bark it (Baow, baow)
When I fly out the M-way, I feel nostalgic
Yay come white like yam, it ain't pounded
Looking for cribs, just fully detached
I came from council housin'
Not in a talk-the-talk, I really walk the walk
Man, this a masterclass, man you can ask the charts
Richard Mille on, you don't know the pass, the password
When it's really on, Wizzy gotta clart it off
No fears 'cah I'm good on the roads where I'm from
You can ask, I'm calm as long as my darg is
Always aim at the target market
Look at the profit margin

I got a gyal up in Chelsea, you know
But why everyone there when you blow?
The feds tryna get help with the roads
Me nuh know, me nuh know, me nuh know
I got gyal everywhere in the globe
But everyone disappears when you're broke
If bro calls me and say it's that time, I don't care
I'm putting my career on hold


Fumez The Engineer
If bro calls me and say it's time, I don't care
I'm putting my ca-, I'm putting my career on hold
But why everyone, but why everyone
But why everyone there when you blow?7Embed
32 TranslationsСрпскиDeutschहिन्दीPortuguês日本語Boat Lyrics
Came in for the embers
Stayed out for the breeze
I need to feel elements to remind me
There's beauty when it's bleak


Stuck out long before lights down
Why do I breathe? Oh, I know


The more that I love, the less that I feel
The times that I jumped never were real
They say that all scars will heal, but I know
Maybe I won't
But the waves won't break my boat
But the waves won't brеak my boat


The stones crash on the boardwalk
Thе wind rush through the trees
I keep my eyes peeled
The memories always fall short
Of what we could've been


Left out long before last call
What do I need? Oh, I know

The more that I love, the less that I feel
The times that I jumped never were real
They say that all scars will heal, but I know
Maybe I won't
But the waves won't break my boat
But the waves won't break my boat


But the waves won't break my boat
The waves won't break my boat


The more that I love, the less that I feel
The times that I jumped never were real
They say that all scars will heal, but I know
Maybe I won't
And the waves won't break my boat1Embed
35 Grade 8 Lyrics
My mind is a warrior, my heart is a foreigner
My eyes are the color of red like a sunset
I'll never keep it bottled up and left to the hands of the coroner
Be a true heart, not a follower, we're not done yet


And I see it in your movements tonight
If we should ever do this right
I'm never gonna let you down
No, I'll never let you down
Now, keep it on the down low
And I'll keep you around, so I'll know
That I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down


You're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8
But I've never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down
Now, you're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8
But I've never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down, down

My eyes are a river filler, this drink is a liver killer
My chest is a pillow for your weary head to lay to rest again
Your body is my ballpoint pen and your mind is my new best friend
Your eyes are the mirror to take me to the edge again


Now, I see it in your movements tonight
If we should ever do this right
I'm never gonna let you down
No, I'll never let you down
Now, keep it on the down low
And I'll keep you around, so I'll know
That I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down


You're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8
But I've never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down
You're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8
But I've never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down

Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now
And I'll never let you down
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now
And I'll never let you down
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now
And I'll never let you down
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now
And I'll never let you down


You're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8
But I've never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down
You're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8
But I've never felt this way

30 Sunburn Lyrics
You're not her, though I try to see you differently
I tow the line, you see, I'm searching for what used to be mine
And I saw your eyes, and I saw Alice staring back at me
So I will try to find another one who suited me as well as her


I've moved far away from you
And I want to see you here beside me, dear
But things aren't clear


When we never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I'd miss you
And I miss you


She was mine
I was hers and all that's in between
If she would cry
I would shelter her and keep her from the darkness that will be

I've moved far away from you
And I want to see you here beside me, dear
But things aren't clear


We never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I'd miss you
And I miss you


Don't drop me in, it's not my turn
If you cut deep, then I might learn
That you scarred and left me, like a sunburn
Don't drop me in, it's not my turn
And if you cut deep, then I might learn
That you'll scar and leave me, like a sunburn


We never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I'd miss you

37 Shirtsleeves Lyrics
I can taste salt water
And if I blink again
You’ll be sinkin' in
So we'll learn to swim in the oceans you made
I'll hold ya
And you think of him
And pretty soon, you'll be floating away


And I'll hold on to the words you spoke of
Anchored down in my throat, love
And I'm captain of the sinking boat now
With just one armband to carry me home


When salted tears won't dry
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes
These hearts will be flooded tonight
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes


I still taste salt water
On my lips from your kiss of bitterness
And I'll drown within the oceans you made
And I hate to love you, these cuffs are covered in your make-up
I'll never trust you again
You can just be a friend

And I'll hold on to the words you spoke of
Anchored down in my throat, love
And I'm captain of the sinking boat now
With just one armband to carry me home


When salted tears won’t dry
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes
These hearts will be flooded tonight
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes


Your eyes, your lips, your mouth
Your thighs, your back, you drive me wild
Tonight, the fact is I
I'm on my way home
I'm on the way home
I lied, I tried to cry but I’m
I'm drownin' in the oceans you made


When salted tears won’t dry
I’ll wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes
These hearts will be flooded tonight
I’ll wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes19Embed
29 TranslationsFrançaisEspañolPortuguêsDeutschEd Sheeran - Leave Your Life (ترجمه‌ی فارسی)Leave Your Life Lyrics
If I forget to say goodbye
Before I catch the plane
Would you know the way that I
Feel when I'm away?
We'll see the same sky tonight
But the stars are out of place
You'll never know the weight of my heart
Every time I leave you, babe


It's hard to break the landing
But I'll see you again


I'm never gonna leave your life
Even at the times I'm miles away, you are always on my mind
Forever and now, I will be by your side
I know it can change from day to day, but this love'll keep alight
I'm never gonna leave your life
I, I'm never gonna leave your life


Oh, I could never tell you, "LY"
Or put in words your finest traits
The darkest green and hazel eyes
And yet, I can't describe the shade
You are all this heart of mine
And there you will remain
You'll never know the weight of my
Decisions when I leave your smiling face

It's hard to understand it
But I'll see you again


Oh, I, I'm never gonna leave your life
Even at the times I'm miles away, you are always on my mind
Forever and now, I will be by your side
I know it can change from day to day, but this love'll keep alight
I'm never gonna leave your life
I, I'm never gonna leave your life


It's hard to break the landing
But I'll see you again


I'm never gonna leave your life
Even at the times I'm miles away, you are always on my mind
Forever and now, I will be by your side
I know it can change from day to day, but this love'll keep alight
I'm never gonna leave your life
I, I'm never gonna leave your life


If I forget to say goodbye
Before I catch the plane
Would you know the way that I
Feel when I'm away?3Embed
19 This Lyrics
This is the start of something beautiful
This is the start of something new
You are the one who'd make me lose it all
You are the start of something new, oh


And I'll throw it all away
Watch you fall into my arms again
And I'll throw it all away
Watch you fall now


You are the earth that I will stand upon
You are the words that I will sing


And I've thrown it all away
And watched you fall into his arms again
And I've thrown it all away
And watched you fall now, woah


And take me back, take me home
Watch me fall down to Earth
Take me back for

This is the start of something beautiful
You are the start of something new20Embed
32 Little Bird Lyrics
If we take this bird in, with its broken leg
We could nurse it, she said
Come inside for a little lie down with me
And if you fall asleep, it wouldn't be the worst thing
But when I wake up, and your make up is on my shoulder
And tell me if I lie down, would you stay now?
Let me hold ya, oh


But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth?
Darling how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do
And it's not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet
'Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon
And I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird
My little bird


If we take a walkout, in the morning dew
We can lay down, so I'm next to you
Come inside for a little homemade tea
And if you fall asleep, then at least you're next to me
And if I wake up, you say it's late love, get back to sleep
I'm covered by nature and I'm safe now
Underneath this oak tree, with you beside me

But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth?
Darling how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do
And it's not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet
'Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon
And I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird
My little bird
My little bird
My little bird


And of all these things I'm sure of, I'm not quite certain of your love
You make me scream, and then I made you cry
When I left that little bird with its broken leg to die


But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth?
Darling how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do
And it's not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet
'Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon
But I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird
My little bird, whoa oh oh oh whoa
My little bird
My little bird
My little bird
You're my little bird11Embed

He got it for the low, low
If you snitchin' I go loco (go crazy)

And not the judge, not my P.O. no
All this sugar, I’m like Nino
Water whip, I’m like Nemo

Bakin' soda, I got bakin' soda

33 I Don’t Want Your Money Lyrics
Ayy, I waited for you all day


I been away on the road for a little while
Today, I'm headin' home to make my baby smile
She hates it when I am over a thousand miles
Away, and I'm not there to pick up when she dials, yeah
She's always lookin back, and sayin' "There was a time
When you would be around every single night
Now, I'm not sayin' that I want another guy
But I need you here for the good times and the bad times
Yeah, the pullin' out my hair, gettin' mad times
Not just the when I'm in your bed on my back times
Baby, every time I call, it's a bad time
Just want you here on your own"


There ain't no diamonds, silver or gold
That can replace a man's love in the home
And she keeps tellin' me over and over


(She say) I don't want your money, baby, oh
You know I just want your time
(She say) I don't want your money, baby, oh
You know I just want your time

I used to be around more, but I was strapped for cash
And that's not attractive, workin' my ass off
Tryna make a success outta myself I guess
I could have been more present, but I was in a mess
I remember bein' on tour, stayin' up on the phone
30 minute conversation, "Boy, when you comin' home?
I can't be buildin' a family life here on my own"
Baby, I'm doin' it for us, so why you takin' that tone?
Like I'm the bad guy
I thought it would have made me better in your dad's eyes
I'm busy stackin' up the paper for the bad times
'Cause, baby, you never know
I'm poppin right now, but there will come a day when I won't


There ain't no diamonds, silver or gold
That can replace a man's love in the home (Yeah)
And she keeps tellin' me over and over


(She say) I don't want your money, baby, oh
You know I just want your time (I want all of your love, your time)
(She say) I don't want your money, baby, oh
You know I just want your time (I just want your, I just want your time)

You know you're my baby (You know you're my baby)
I'm sorry I been away, yeah, no lie
Boy, you drive me crazy
Why you gotta mess with my mind?
You know you're my baby (You know you're, oh)
I'm sorry I been away, yeah, no lie
Boy, you drive me crazy, you know, you know


I don't want your money, baby, oh (I don't want your money)
You know I just want your time (Yeah, I want, yeah, I want your time)
(She say) I don't want your money, baby, oh (I don't want your money)
You know I just want your time (Time, time)


And I love, and I love, and I love you
Yeah, I love, and I love, and I love you
And I love, and I love, and I love you
But I want your time, yeah

26 TranslationsEspañolPortuguêsDeutschEd Sheeran - Love In Slow Motion (ترجمه‌ی فارسی)Love in Slow Motion Lyrics
It's been a while since we been alone
To turn off the world and the telephone
I need to tell you you're beautiful
'Cause it's been a while and I apologize
I just get caught up in the rat race I'm runnin'
Chasin' a moment I'm hoping is comin'
If I stopped and took a look around
It's in front of my eyes, eyes


Baby, let's slow down time
Maybe just press rewind
Darlin', that dress reminds
Me of the first time


And I wanna love tonight
One on one by the candlelight
Over and over, we spend our lives
Livin' fast forward but not tonight
Love in slow motion


It's been a while since it was you and me
Too many friends, too many evening drinks
Yeah, we commit to so many things
But not to ourselves, and I apologize
Sometimes, you're sad and you tell me it's nothin'
And I brush it off because there's always somethin'
But I need to change my perspective
And prioritise-ise

'Cause one thing I know is this
Every moment missed
Can be restored with your lips
It only takes one kiss


And I wanna love tonight
One-on-one by the candlelight
Over and over, we spend our lives
Livin' fast forward but not tonight
Love in slow motion


Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh


Love tonight
One-on-one by the candlelight
Over and over, we spend our lives
Livin' fast forward but not tonight
Love in slow motion
Wanna love tonight
One on one by the candlelight
Over and over, we spend our lives
Livin' fast forward but not tonight
Love in slow motion

27 No Love for the Lonely Lyrics
No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely
No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely


Another night, another club
Another room, another one
When morning comes, I'm running off
I found lust, but I wanna find love
And every time I get close, I run wild and explode
I don't know why, you're not enough


No lie, yeah, my mama never raised me to be a bad boy
To chase women and to only break hearts, that's fine
When you're eighteen but when you're older
To find love, yeah, you gotta grow up sometimes
Being solo is the way to go, but I've been doing it too long
But you never know though
'Cause maybe you could just be the one, ayy


Summer nights, and no love for the lonely
Don't come near me, 'cause I'll only break your heart
And I will try to find someone to hold me
My love is a flickering candle
In the dark

Another night, another day
Been thinking 'bout it wide awake
I never thought I'd be alone
While everybody blowing up my phone
Don't trust no one, no, so don't want to get close
I get mine, I walk away


No lie, yeah, my mama always told me to be a bad girl
Never let anybody get in the way of what I'm trying to do now
This ain't man's world, thank you next, I'ma go my own way
Sometimes being solo is the way to go
When you need to figure shit out
And if I want you boy, I'ma tell you so
'Cause I'm the one in control, yeah


Summer nights, and no love for the lonely
Don't come near me, 'cause I'll only break your heart
And I will try to find someone to hold me
My love is a flickering candle, in the dark


No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely
No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely (No lo-lo-love)
No lo-lo-love for the lonely (Yuh), no lo-lo-love for the lonely (No lo-lo-love)
No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely (Oh, yeah)

Summer nights, and no love for the lonely
Don't come near me, 'cause I'll only break your heart
And I will try to find someone to hold me, yeah
My love is a flickering candle (Flickering candle, yeah), in the dark


No lo-lo-love for the lonely (Yuh), no lo-lo-love for the lonely, in the dark (No lo-lo-love)
No lo-lo-love for the lonely (Love for the lonely), no lo-lo-love for the lonely, in the dark


And I will try to find someone to hold me (Mhm)
My love is a flickering candle, in the dark6Embed
27 Cold Coffee Lyrics
She's like cold coffee in the morning
I'm drunk off of last night's whiskey and coke
She'll make me shiver without warning
And make me laugh as if I'm in on the joke


You can stay with me forever
Or you could stay with me for now


Tell me if I'm wrong
Tell me if I'm right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight
Tell me if I know
Tell me if I do
Tell me how to fall in love the
Way you want me to


I'll wake with coffee in the morning
But she prefers two lumps of sugar and tea
Outside the day is up and calling
But I don't have to be so, please go back to sleep

Stay with me forever
Or you could stay with me for now


Tell me if I'm wrong
Tell me if I'm right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight
Tell me if I know
Tell me if I do
Tell me how to fall in love the
Way you want me to


'Cause I love the way you wake me up
And for goodness sake, will my love not be enough?


Tell me if I'm wrong
Tell me if I'm right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight
Tell me if I know
Tell me if I do
Tell me how to fall in love the
Way you want me to

Tell me if I'm wrong
Tell me if I'm right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight7Embed
29 TranslationsEspañolPortuguêsDeutschEd Sheeran - Stop The Rain (ترجمه‌ی فارسی)Stop The Rain Lyrics
Another human cloud to bring you down
When you blew the last away
And bring out a poisoned tongue or plastic crown
But for me, they look the same
Well, sometimes, it can get all too much for me
And that's why the photograph gets burned
Throw the match in gasoline, a-ayy


Don't let the ones who hurt you see you cry
Tomorrow is another day


You cannot stop the rain, no way
Holdin' an umbrella when the grey clouds come over again
Tryna find somethin' real, but it's not the game they play
Pretendin' that the weather is in your mind, you got no one to blame
But that's just the way I feel


You cannot stop the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You cannot stop the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


Another "I, Me, Mine" to blur the lines
Between love and then heartbreak
Oh, it's a lonely life thinkin' you're right
And always shiftin' blame
And every time it's gettin' more and more ugly
And that's why the photograph gets burned
Throw the match in gasoline, a-ayy

Don't let them tell you, "Keep it all inside"
I know the winds have got to change


You cannot stop the rain, no way
Holdin' an umbrella when the grey clouds come over again
Tryna find somethin' real, but it's not the game they play
Pretendin' that the weather is in your mind, you got no one to blame
But that's just the way I feel


You cannot stop the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You cannot stop the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


And it seems like time
Can be so much more than a wake-up call
And live real life
Every day is a chance that we can start over
Read my mind
There'll be ups and downs, but it won't change a thing
Between you and I
There's one thing I can't change


You cannot stop the rain, no way
Holdin' an umbrella when the grey clouds come over again
Tryna find somethin' real, but it's not the game they play
Pretendin' that the weather is in your mind, you got no one to blame
But that's just the way I feel
You cannot stop the rain, no way
Holdin' an umbrella when the grey clouds come over again
Tryna find somethin' real, but it's not the game they play
Pretendin' that the weather is in your mind, you got no one to blame
But that's just the way I feel

You cannot stop the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You cannot stop the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


Can't stop the rain, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Can't stop the rain, yeah
You can't stop the rain (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You can't stop the rain
You can't stop the rain (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
No, can't stop the rain (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

38 The City Lyrics
This city never sleeps
I hear the people walk by when it's late
Sirens bleed through my windowsill
I can't close my eyes
Don't control what I'm into
And this tower is alive
The lights that blind keep me awake
Hood up and lace untied
Sleep fills my mind
Can't control what I'm into


London calls me a stranger, a traveller
This is now my home, my home (Woo!)


I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
If the city never sleeps, then that makes two


The pavement is my friend
It will take me where I need to go
I find it trips me up
And puts me down
This is not what I'm used to
And the shop across the road
Fills my needs and gives me company when I need it
Voices speak through my walls
I don't think I'm gonna make it
Past tomorrow

London calls me a stranger, a traveller
This is now my home, my home (Woo!)


I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
If the city never sleeps, then that makes two


And my lungs hurt, and my ears bled
With the sound of the city life echoed in my head
Do I need this to keep me alive?
The traffic stops and starts, but I need to move along

London calls me a stranger
This is not my home, home


I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
If the city never sleeps, then that makes two17Embed
26 Take Me Back to London (Sir Spyro Remix) Lyrics
Jet plane headed up to the sky
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high
We ain't hit a rave in a while (Sounds of the Sir)
So take me back to (Yo) London


I do deals, but I never get twanged (Twanged)
Moves that ain't ever been planned (Planned)
Know goons that were never in gangs (Gangs)
Where I'm from, chat shit get banged (What?)
Where I'm from, chat shit, let a 12 gauge rip
Yeah, it's sick how it fits in my hand (Hand)
I don't mix with the glitz and the glam (Glam)
All these stupid pricks on the 'Gram
I don't do online beef, or neeky grime beef
I'm way too G'd up to beef with grime neek
I bought an AP to help me time keep
My shooter ride deep, he moves when I speak
My shooter ride (Ride), he shoot a guy (Guy)
Leave you wet like you scuba dived
We were younger then and now we're unified
South London boys, get you crucified, I'm gone


It's that time
Big Mike and Teddy are on grime
I wanna try new things, they just want me to sing
Because nobody thinks I write rhymes
And now I'm back in the bits with my guy
Give me a packet of crisps with my pint
I hit my friends up, go straight to the pub
'Cause I haven't been home in time, yes, I
But that's my fault (Oh)
Grossed half a billi' on the Divide Tour (Oh)
Yes, I ain't kidding, what would I lie for? (Oh)
But now I'm back on the track with Big Michael (Woah)
He said, "Teddy, never get off your high horse
And never let 'em take your crown"
I've been away for a while, travelled a million miles
But I'm heading back to London town right now

Jet plane headed up to the sky (To the sky)
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high (Woop, woop)
We ain't hit a rave in a while (In a what?)
So take me back to London
Bass high, middle nights, ceilin' low (Ceilin' low)
Sweat brow drippin' down, when in Rome (When in Rome)
No town does it quite like my home (They don't)
So take me back to— Birmingham, 0121, stand up!


You better tell them the hooligan's here
My team can't lose when I'm here
Outside, quick twos and a beer
You see me when I choose to appear
Just paid a few bags for my carpet
Blud, take off your shoes when you're here
Yo, I can turn boos into cheers
Tiptronic man cruise through the gears
Rep blues when I'm here
It's Brum
Fam, are you dumb?
Red red wine or you want a redrum
You can be forty, you don't wanna war me
End of story, you're gunna get spun
Man smoke weed til my whole head's numb
Don't talk greaze 'cause I won't take none
VIP in my own section
Wild wild west with the old western, it's Brum!

Old school raving, back to scally
And the AP, packed with gally
Take me back to Manny
Blacked out Roll full of yack and maggy
And a S3 boot full of packs of Cali
Hit the booth, man, slap it, snap it
Bap bap, that's that, track wrapped, I'm happy
Some man are blessed, some are bad and trappy
Gets cold up north, pack your hat and trackie'
Huh, man was made to set pace
Young Aitch, I came for first place
Made a change to get paid
Fam, I stayed in my lane and came with that flame
Day to day we on stage
Make my K, then I skate and catch the next plane
Baking up when I wake
Rake it up, get it saved
It's make it or break


It's make it or break
Human man, still make a mistake
Mad now Aitch just made a mixtape
Told Jaykae to make the next eight
We 'bout to set pace'
I can't get about no more it gets bait
And I don't get head no more, I get face
She don't want him no more, she wants Jay
And she don't want me no more, she wants Aitch (Aye)
Jaykae, make a lot of P (Uh)
Go straight there if that's where I've got to be
Wait, stop, pop my collar, I'm a G
5 million minimum, what I wanna see
I ain't in it for the money, put that to bed
Tell mumsy that I'm on a track with Ed
Aim this one at your head
Write bars with a pen on a pad when the battery's dead

Jet plane headed up to the sky (0161)
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high (0121)
We ain't hit a rave in a while (Sounds of the S—)
So take me back to London (Woo)
Bass high, middle nights, ceilin' low
Sweat brow drippin' down, when in Rome
No town does it quite like my home (Like my home)
So take me back to London3Embed
14 No Name (The Bastard Executioner Theme Song) Lyrics
Born with a heart
That could ache more than beat
The mind of the killer
The soul of the meek
Born aimless and angry
Ran hard from the day
Left love at the crossroad
Into a man that I hate


Father, do you burn if your hand is in fire?
Does your head spin with rage when fooled by the liars?
Should I drop to my knees?
Scream your name out in vain?
Tell me good teacher, are we all just insane?


King of the kings, do you feel any pain?


I fight for the hope
That blood has a face
To give me a kiss
For the faith that I wait
Flock with no shepherd
Is a vulnerable game
I can live without heart, without love
But I do need a name

Father, do you burn if your hand is in fire?
Does your head spin with rage when fooled by the liars?
Should I drop to my knees?
Scream your name out in vain?
Tell me good teacher, are we all just insane?


King of the kings, do you feel any pain?
King of the kings, do you feel any pain?
King of the kings, do you feel any pain?6Embed
29 You Need Me, I Don’t Need You (Remix) Lyrics
I still got a rucksack with the old clothes, I rap with cold flows
I'm back with the most jokes, in fact you don't know
On tracks I throw blows to make my punchlines relevant
If you can't keep up you'll get none, you're celibate
My flow's developing, skin lacks the melanin
Give me a shot of adrenaline and I get it in
I do it for the hell of it
Ever since I hit the mainstream with The A Team I seem to sell a bit
I took what held me back with the women and then I packaged the image
Put in some content and I then I sold it back as a gimmick
The fact is this, I'll end up dating actresses
Wake up on dirty mattresses, I think I'll need to practice this
But I make shit happen, call me a laxative
World's on my shoulders, I don't even know what Atlas is
Hard bars sharp like a cactus is
I'm back to rappping, back to back cause I've been practicing
I'm back to sing this


You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
X2
You need me

I said you need 3 man I don't need 2
Not none of ya, unorthodox runner up
In my own gear like I'm stepping on a double clutch
No brakes, cut them up, the tyres stay screeching
Now I've found out being odd ain't even
I qualified for everything, long straight season
It's not a dilemma king, got a straight queening
You are what you eat, that's something to believe in
MC with the mic is MC dinner time
Now I'm feeling gassed, like, MC give me light
I didn't even have to do a disco rap
I bet I still end up with a Sisqó plaque
This is what happens when your gift is talent
And all you imagined exists, imagine
I never drop shit and I came from the back end
Now I've got the game in my hand, I'mma smash it




You need me, but I dont need you
D-E-V-L-I-N Ed and 32
Lyrically more capable to break 'em all
I won't have to amputate a lower limb to make them fall
Like autumn, check my post mortem
The game passed away upon the day I came and killed it for this fortune
I don't mean money, I mean luck
But now the clock's aviated
Everybody's time's up
Nothing's what I had and everything's what I gave
Like a sprinter near the finish line fighting for his place
Keep your diamonds and your chains
I can walk for any manner, any time of day and stay safe
Cause I get respected
While they get detested
Tell the truth there ain't nobody that done what Devs did
If you ain't on the tune or Eminem or 5'9
You ain't competition just a fish you're tryna bite a line

6 You Need Me, I Don’t Need You (Live Ustream Version) Lyrics
Now I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That’s you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud
I can’t, no, I won’t hush
I’ll say the words that make you blush
I’m gonna sing this now
See, I’m true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I’m real, I do it all, it’s all me
I’m not fake, don’t ever call me lazy
I won’t stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me


'Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me

I sing and write my own tune and I write my own verse hell
Don't need another wordsmith to make my tunes sell
Call yourself a singer-writer, you’re just bluffing
Name’s on the credits and you didn’t write nothing
I sing, fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to BRIT School
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can’t last, if I’m smoking on a crack pipe
And I won’t be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear in Wikipedia
And musically I’m demonstrating
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the enterprise when some fella filmed me
A young singer writer like a Gabriella Cilmi


'Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man

And all I want in this cold world is to make music and use it
Not to abuse it and get affected, infected with the who's who of music
Who did it, who is it, who's in it or what the hell does it matter?
Chitter chatter, don't matter what a yidder, yidder, yadder, it don't matter to me
All I want is a bit of dignity in me to battle this industry freely
To be me in this seedy, needy world, can you hear me?
Hey, so I keep singing that
When I first started this rapping shit I felt pressure from haters
Became invaded with sadists and just developed a hater radar
And made for the stars, kept my grind in the dark
And then appeared with a remedy kicking rhymes with a melody
Hennessey shots and... all these fools on the block
Who said you gotta be a gangster now to raise the top?
Just a normal, casual, usual, everyday type of guy
With my head in the sky, Ed Sheeran, Urban Angel coming ready to die
So see the signs, stand to the side
Open your eyes and take a look and realise
The resurrection's arrived and as the mist clears
I arise from my tomb in disguise, all alone, A lone star
Urban Angel rising from the ashes, surprising all haters
Guiding, now moving steady when we say


Ayy, ayy, we bring the stars out
We bring the women and the cars and the cards out
Let's have a toast of celebration, get a glass out
And we can do this until we pass out, pass out
Yeah, we bring the stars out
We bring the women and the cars and the cards out
Let's have a toast of celebration, get a glass out
And we can do this until we pass out

'Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man


My eyes are red, I've been burning
I've been burning
My eyes are red, I've been burning
I've been burning
My eyes are red I've been burning
I've been burning on a spliff off your high grade
My eyes are red I've been burning
I've been burning, burning, burning


Now where I come from burning weed it is a habit
A big fat bag of high grade weed, you know I got to have it
'Cause if I don't have it in my pocket I'm going to panic
'Cause like I said where I come from weed smoking is a habit
Yup, we'll do da bun in the place up in the hood
One of them things I have inherited like a ghetto man should
One of them things is smoking weed it yes it makes me feel good
Burning high grade sensimilla, yes it makes me feel
But me is a man, ah, talk about sensimilla is a drug
And if I start to smoke it I'ma-nna turn into a thug
Where I come from that they talking could that only get you mugged
Where I come from burning weed it is a blessing from above
Where I come from yes we bun it when we listen rub a dub
Where I come from yes we bun after we just-a make a love
Where I come from yes we bun it when the sun starts shine
I blaze high grade weed all the time


Now my eyes are red
'Cause you need me, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
And you need me, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man




'Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right
I won't stop until my name's in lights
At stadium heights, with Damian Rice
On red carpets, now I'm on Arabian Nights
Because I'm young, I know my brothers gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter, yeah
The game's over but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows but
I haven't got a house plus I live on a couch
So you believe the lyrics when I'm singing them out
Wow, from day one I've been prepared
With V05 wax for my ginger hair
Now I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of
What the future holds cause it's another day
Plus
I'll keep my last name forever, keep this genre pretty basic
And I'll be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Slipping into another rapper shoes using new laces
I'm selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the majors
Nationwide tour with Just Jack, still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the moustache
I hit back, when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago, but more people hear me though
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos
I'm always doing shows if I'm not I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up, call me Rufio
Melody music maker, reading all the papers
They say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevatorEmbed
23 TranslationsDeutschPenguins Lyrics
I met her smokin' a cigarette in a toilet cubicle
Red  dress, tattooed chest, she's beautiful
This  ain't the time or place to start a future, but, darlin', I don't care
Broken hearts can find a love to make them whole anywhere


Well, darlin', here we go again
We  are only man and woman and we all make mistakes
"Don't  you know we're only human?", is what I heard you say
And when I heard those words, I knew them, oh, I could feel your pain
'Cause  I have felt the same, no


Oh, she said we are penguins on the ice
We're not meant to fly, but God knows we can try
And I see a hope that's in her eyes
Oh,  can you see the love in mine?


She told about her mum and dad and they sound just like mine
Day by day, exchangin' names, and two souls intertwined
And we have both got it wrong from time to time, but let that go
We lead each other hand in hand as we mend our broken souls


Well, darlin', here we go again
Oh, we are only blood and bones that cover beatin' hearts
Scarred by sticks and stones, but we know who we are
And I could put you back together when you come apart
And we should make a start now, oh

Oh, she said we are penguins on the ice
We're not meant to fly, but God knows we can try
And I see a hope that's in her eyes
Oh, can you see the love in mine?


And it feels like we found serenity
And some things are not what they seem
My love, right now it's only you and me


Oh, she said we are penguins on the ice
We're not meant to fly, but God knows we can try
And I see a hope that's in her eyes
Oh, can you see the love in mine?
Oh, she said we are penguins on the ice
We're not meant to fly, but God knows we can try
And I see a hope that's in her eyes
Oh, can you see the love in mine?
Oh, can you see the love in mine?
Oh, can you see the love in mine?1Embed

You were loved before you had arrived
And every day that love just multiplies
Daddy made your bed and your lullaby
And Mumma made the mobile in the sky
And lovin' you is easy
But life will not always be
Fall into the world of your song
Whatever you feel could never be wrong


Come along for the ride
And in the shake of a lamb's tail, we'll go
Yeah, be still now and close your eyes


And dream
Hangin' out with the Sandman
You look so sweet, my child
Hangin' out with the Sandman
Although there's rain outside, you'll bе warm and dry
The thunder and the lightning won't hurt you now
So go to sleep, my lovе
Hangin' out with the Sandman


Chocolate-covered roof and candy cars
Rainbow sugar river we can sail upon
Marshmallow books and strawberries
Snowmen made of ice cream
Over the flower fields, we'll fly
We'll count the fish in the sky
Honeybees and birds sing your song
Whatever you feel can never be wrong

Come along for the ride
And in the shake of a lamb's tail, we'll go
Yeah, be still now and close your eyes


And dream
Hangin' out with the Sandman
You look so sweet, my child
Hangin' out with the Sandman
Although there's rain outside, you'll be warm and dry
The thunder and the lightning won't hurt you now
So go to sleep, my love

The thunder and the lightning won't hurt you now
So go to sleep, my love
Hangin' out with the Sandman

A lifetime is startin' to feel like
It's fallin' short of the mark
But it's all that we got
Every teardrop, every wrong turn
Made the moment we found
And it's comin' around, around, around, around, around


I don't wanna miss one thing
We can turn the whole world down
And listen to the in-between
We are, we are the sound
There's nothin' but the space we're in
The hurry and the noise shut out
Just stay here and be right now


The shadows cling to the ceiling
And fracture the light
That lands in our eyes
Every moment changes the whole view
And just when it ends
I feel it again, again, again, again, again


I don't wanna miss one thing
We can turn the whole world down
And listen to the in-between
We are, we are the sound
There's nothin' but the space we're in
The hurry and the noise shut out
Just stay here and be right now

Nothin' else matters
Nothin' else matters
Nothin' else matters
Stay here and be right now
Nothin' else matters
Nothin' else matters
Nothin' else matters
Just stay here and be right now


I don't wanna miss one thing
We can turn the whole world down
And listen to the in-between
We are, we are the sound
There's nothin' but the space we're in
The hurry and the noise shut out
Just stay here and be right now10Embed

How was I to know? It's a crazy thing
I showed you my hand and you still let me win
And who was I to say that this was meant to be?
The road that was broken brought us together


And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that would give you a diamond ring
When I fold, you see the best in me
The joker and the queen


I've been played before, if you hadn't guessed
So I kept my cards close to my foolproof vest
But you called my bluff (But you called my bluff)
And saw through all my tells (And saw through all my tells)
And then you went all in
And we left together


And I know you think that what makes a king
Is gold, a palace, and diamond rings
When I fold, you see the best in mе
The joker and the queen



And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hеarts that would give you a diamond ring
When I folded, you saw the best in me
The joker and the queen

29 TranslationsEspañolहिन्दी2step (Remix) Lyrics
I had a bad week
Spent the evening pretending it wasn't that deep
You could see in my eyes that it was taking over
I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment
You know you take all of my stress right down
Help me get it off my chest and out
Into the ether with the rest of this mess that just keeps us depressed
We forget that we're here right now


'Cause we're livin' life at a different pace
Stuck in a constant race
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break
Something's gotta change
We should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn
If we're missin' out on what the people think is right
Seein' through a picture behind the screen and forget to be
Lose the conversation for the message that you'll never read
I think maybe you and me
Oh, we should head out to the place where the music plays
And then


We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone, then loved
And all we need is us to go all

Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us (Baby)


Sun comin' up when we walk out, we lost the track of time
Everything that I'd been dealin' with ain't even crossed my mind
I don't see nobody in here but us, for real, for you I'm blind
We go anywhere, don't take much for us to catch a vibe
Come here, I need to tell you somethin', let me whisper in your ear
Do whatever to get you there, I'll put you on a Lear, yeah
Private island for a month straight, they'll think you disappeared
Lamb truck'll look good on you, I'm coppin' you that Urus
I think I'm 'bout ready to make love in this club
Only thing I need is my drink and my drugs
I done got on ten and forgot where I was
Some parts I don't like, but this part I love
Only me and my guys
I been havin' me a good time, you can see it all in my eyes
Two-steppin' with shawty, got her rockin' side to side
You should let me know when you get ready to ride 'cause


We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love (I love)
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone, then loved
And all we need is us to go all (All night)

Night, night

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh


Waking up, midnight November
And you're still in my bed
It's kinda rough, cause since I met ya
There's things we've never said


So if I go for a little while longer
When I'm home we can talk about the pitfalls of the road
If you say go, I would stop everything oh
My heart would play the role now
And act like it's never been broke


Though my soul, oh oh oh
Lately I really need to know
How long, how long, can we be touch and go
Oh my soul, oh oh oh
How long, how long, can we be touch and go

It's not enough, to say I want ya
Cause I'll say anything
I'm holding out, to feel without a doubt
I had have just been questioning it


If I go for a little while longer
When I'm home we can talk about the pitfalls of the road
If you say go, I would stop everything oh
My heart would play the role now
And act like it's never been broke


Though my soul, oh oh oh
Lately I really need to know
How long, how long, can we be touch and go
Oh my soul, oh oh oh
How long, how long, can we be


All of my bones, they scream I'm right
If you're taking me home to stay the night
Darling my soul would heal


If you say go, I would stop everything oh
My heart would play the role
And act like it's never been broke, though my soul
Lately I really need to know
How long, how long, can we be touch and go
Oh my soul, how long

19 TranslationsPortuguêsNew York Lyrics
Ooh, ooh, whoa, oh, oh, oh now now


Five drinks in on Friday night
We only came to dry your eyes
And get you out of your room
Now this bar has closed it's doors
I found my hand is holding yours
Do you wanna go home so soon?
Or maybe we should take a ride through the night
And sing along to every song that's on the radio
In the back of a taxi cab in Brooklyn
Oh no no, the sun could rise
Burning all the street lamps out at 3AM
So DJ, play it again


Until the night turns into morning
You'll be in my arms
We'll just keep driving
Along the boulevard
And if I kissed you, darling
Please don't be alarmed
It's just the start
Of everything if you want
A new love
In New York

Yesterday, gave me a call
Stressing out about it all
Said the world is moving too fast
And you don't know where to begin
'Cause you've spent a lifetime fitting in
Only to wind up on the other side
By yourself
And every day
Screaming out
To all the people that you used to know
From a window that looks upon Manhattan skyline
It's just the way that life goes
And you hear it in every song you know
So DJ, play it again


Until the night turns into morning
You'll be in my arms
We'll just keep driving
Along the boulevard
And if I kissed you, darling
Please don't be alarmed
It's just the start
Of everything if you want
A new life
In New York

And every song that plays
Is just like the day you had
And it's okay to cry
But I'm saying maybe that's
A waste of water
You know I'm here for you
In the back of the taxi cab tonight
In New York


It's just reached the morning
And you're still in my arms
And we've stopped driving
Down the boulevard
And I just kissed you, darling
I hope you weren't alarmed
It's just the start
Of everything that you want
A new love
In New York4Embed
19 Don’t (Rick Ross Remix) Lyrics
Hit the corner, burnin' rubber like a stunt driver
Burning marijuana, bitch, I'm a bit liver
Gotta keep a bitch in check, microphone check
Killed your boy's career, still no arrest yet
Snow white yacht in my red Yeezys
Ed Sheeran got the city streets tweakin'
On a back block you may catch the boss
M-cig, let it vape so we liftin' off
With a weapon, go to steppin' like I'm Kevin Spacey
No prom date, women they would love to hate me
It's such a pretty thing, life is such a bitch
Went to sleep as friends, waking up to this
See it my way or see me at the top
Built an empire, bitch, off a nickel rock
Microphone check, microphone check
We came to party, smoke until there's nothing left


I met this girl late last year
She said "don't you worry if I disappear"
I told her "I'm not really looking for another mistake"
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me "I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM"
Baby, if you wanted me then should have just said, she's singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe


And for a couple weeks I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him, how I was confused about
Now she should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe


(Knock knock knock) on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realised what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe20Embed

Major Lazer for the ladies
Ed Sheeran and Kranium
You know your body look good
So good, so good, yeah


The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like


Girl, you know I want your love

17 She Lyrics
I paid all my dues
And she wanted to know
That I’d never leave her
But now I’m ready to go
And strange as it seems
She’s endless to me
She’s just like paperwork
But harder to read


Patience's my enemy
And loving’s my friend
It’s harder to leave with my heart on my sleeve
Than to stay and just pretend
Oh, she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself


I made all my plans
And as she has made hers
She kept me in mind
But I wasn’t sure
I searched every room
For a way to escape
But every time I tried to leave
She keeps holding on to me for dear life
And blocking my way

Patience's my enemy
And loving’s my friend
It’s harder to leave with my heart on my sleeve
Than to stay and just pretend
Oh, she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself


And like the back of her hand
She already understands everything
"Won’t you stay?" She says
And she already knows how it goes
And where she stands
I’ll stay, anyway
Cause she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself
Oh, she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself
I know myself
Oh, she knows me like I know myself
I know myself
I know myself
I know myself4Embed

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead

Agárrame por la cintura y no me sueltes más
Sólo sígueme, sígueme"

We push and pull like a magnet do

9 2step (Ukrainian Remix) Lyrics
I had a bad week
Spent the evening pretending it wasn't that deep
You could see in my eyes that it was taking over
I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment
You know you take all of my stress right down
Help me get it off my chest and out
Into the ether with the rest of this mess that just keeps us depressed
We forget that we’re here right now


'Cause we're livin’ life at a different pace, stuck in a constant race
Keep the prеssure on, you're bound to break, somеthing's got to change
We should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn
If we're missin' out on what the people think is right
Seein' through a picture behind the screen and forget to be
Lose the conversation for the message that you'll never read
I think maybe you and me
Oh, we should head out to the place where the music plays
And then


We'll go all night
Two-steppin’ with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothin’ when I'm in your eyes, electrified
We’ll keep turnin' up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low, then up, alone, then loved
And all we need is us to go all

Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us


Сирени обірвали наш сон, у дві валізи все минуле
Далі go go, ти за кермо, у невідоме
І всі нерви в кулак, і не рви мене так
Я залишаюся вдихати дим
Останні запахи Dior із ним
Я пам'ятаю, ти хотіла в Рим
Все йде до того, що спочатку на Крим, ми свій двіж замутим
Ніхто не вийде із води сухим
Нас застав напряжний ранок як серіал-драма
Місяцями герої ми тут і ми тут шоураннери
Горить сюжет, скільки ще ракет
Мила, обіцяю, коли все мине
Я танцюватиму з тобою so slow
І цілуватиму тебе де любов-ов-ов
Знов і знов, чекай мене, коли все це мине
Я впаду з тобою в цей flow
Зацілую туди, де любов-ов-ов
Знов і знов, чекай мене, коли все це мине

Night, night
Two-steppin’ with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us to go all night
Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us to go all night4Embed
10 ...Baby One More Time Lyrics
Oh baby, baby
How was I supposed to know
That somethin' wasn't right here?
Oh baby, baby
I shouldn't have let you go
'Cause now you're out of sight, yeah


Show me how you want it to be
Tell me, baby, 'cause I need to know now, oh, because


My loneliness is killin' me, and I
I must confess I still believe, still believe
When you're not with me, I lose my mind
Gimme a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time


Oh, baby, baby
The reason I breathe is you
Yeah, you got me stranded
Oh, pretty baby
There's nothin' that I wouldn't do
It's not the way I planned it

Show me how you want it to be
Oh, tell me, babe, 'cause I need to know now, oh, because


My loneliness is killin' me, and I
I must confess I still believe, still believe
When you're not with me, I lose my mind
Gimme a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time


Oh baby, baby, how was I supposed to know?
Oh, pretty baby, I shouldn't let you go
Oh, I must confess, that my loneliness is killin' me now
Hit me, baby, one more time


My loneliness is killin' me, and I
I must confess I still believe, still believe
When you're not with me, I lose my mind
Gimme a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time
When I'm not with you, I lose my mind
Gimme a sign

35 Homeless Lyrics
Could I wake up next to you when we're hitting double figures?
Look into your eyes like I'm looking into double mirrors
Could you make it any clearer? Everything's such a blur
It's not my turn, it's hers to get hurt
On a late night, coming home from way too many train rides
Lace not as red as my face, I'm home at the same time
Highbury estate's fine, smoking like a dragon, but don't chase lines, hey


I haven't slept for the past week
Two hours ain't enough for me
I feel inspired, at quarter to three am
I haven't changed since our last meet
I'm still getting all my meals for free
I think I'm being shunned by my feet again


It's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
It's not a homeless life for me, yeah

And now I'm sitting on a night bus, flicking through my iPod
Feeling kinda tired so I try to close my eyes up
Driver, turn the lights off, lights on, on stage, mics on
Song plays, nice one, gotta keep my hype strong
Truth be, never went to UNI
People see right through me, but I'm not a fool, see
I'm never gonna do one, I'm gonna live past 22, done
Everything I need to except get a 2:1


I haven't slept for the past week
Two hours ain't enough for me
I feel inspired, at quarter to three am
I haven't changed since our last meet
I'm still getting all my meals for free
I think I'm being shunned by my feet again


It's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me, yeah

When I feel cold
You keep me warm
And I'm not looking for some loose change
Just wanna find a true mate who wants to be my duvet, yeah


It's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
It's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
It's not a homeless life for me, yeah11Embed
24 Gold Rush Lyrics
Smoke alarm went off at nine
I woke up, wiped the sleep out of my eye
She left a note "I'll be back in 5"
Well, I'm still waitin' for that moment to arrive, hey


I was told to put my job in front of you
But it won't hold me like you do


But I do it for the love, waitin' on the gold rush
Keep it on the edge, smokin' on a roll up
When I see my friends, all they say is hold up
Ed, remember the time
When we were in school listenin' to grown-ups?
Didn't learn a thing, but then again, you know what?
You know how to sing, but, you don't know anything other than that
So maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
And maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way you wanna be loved

I never told her that I liked
The way she dances slightly out of time
And pretends she knows the words to a song she's never heard
But I tell her all the time, hey


I was told to put my job in front of you
But it won't hold me like you do


But I do it for the love, waitin' on the gold rush
Keep it on the edge, smokin' on a roll up
When I see my friends, all they say is hold up
Ed, remember the time
When we were in school listenin' to grown-ups?
Didn't learn a thing, but then again, you know what?
You know how to sing, but, you don't know anything other than that
So maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
And maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way you wanna be loved
But I do it for the love, waitin' on the gold rush
Keep it on the edge, smokin' on a roll up
When I see my friends, all they say is hold up
Ed, remember the time
When we were in school listenin' to grown-ups?
Didn't learn a thing, but then again, you know what?
You know how to sing, but, you don't know anything other than that
So maybe you should learn to love her

4 Love Yourself (Live) LyricsHi, I'm Ed Sheeran, in session here and this is my cover... kind of... of Justin Bieber's 'Love Yourself...



For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't


And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that


My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own


'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from


And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that


My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own


'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?


'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
Oh, if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself1Embed
26 One Night Lyrics
Lying in a bedroom, lighting up a Benson
Face hair is growing, so I cut it with a vengeance
Hey, did I mention, as she makes an entrance
Said I had a tendency to finish off her sentence?
Oh, well, she's a local girl
No make-up 'cause she knows me well
Hair tied up in elastic band
With a kiss on the cheek for her one-night man
Is it fast food? I'll regret it after
And I needed money but I'm too shy to ask her
So she buys me chips and cheese
And I tell her that I love her and she's all I need
I take it with a cold glass of the fruit and the barley
She's still a sucker for the apple and Bacardi
Heading to the party, sitting in the car seat
B.E.P. on radio, it makes me feel naughty and lastly
She knows me well
Bit of a catch to have a local girl
Hair tied up in elastic band
With a kiss on the cheek for her one-night man


I don't wanna go alone
I don't wanna go alone
No, I don't wanna go alone

Tell her that I love her, tell her that I need her
Tell her that she's more than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near
Tell her that I want her, tell her that I need her
Tell her that she's more than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her more than anyone else
If you don't, I'll tell her myself


And we've got that love in us, so if the drink kill us
We're gonna dance all night 'til the floor feel us
If we talk outside, so you hate wasps, too?
I don't really dance, so I'll just watch you
Are you taking me back tonight?
Tell me if that’s alright, I don't wanna be here
I'm not the sofa type
Tell me if you have a toothbrush you don't mind sharing
She said, "I wanna take off what you're wearing"


And I don't wanna go alone
I don't wanna go alone
I don't wanna go alone

Tell her that I love her, tell her that I need her
Tell her that she's more than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near
Tell her that I want her, tell her that I need her
Tell her that she's more than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her more than anyone else
If you don't, I'll tell her myself


She's like the fast food, I'll regret it after
And I needed money but I’m too shy to ask her
But she buys me chips and cheese
So I tell her that she's all I need


Tell her that I, tell her that I
Tell her that she's more than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near
Tell her that I, tell her that I
Tell her that she's more than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her more than anyone else
If you don't, I'll tell her myself
Now tell her that I love her, tell her that I need her
Tell her that she's more than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near
Tell her that I want her, tell her that I need her
Tell her that she's more than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her more than anyone else
If you don't, I'll tell her myself11Embed
18 F64 Lyrics
Yo, Jam, this is a letter to you
It's been a while, but it's been hard for me to get in the booth
And since we last spoke, I've become a father of two
Tryna live life with a smile, but that's been harder to do
'Cause all I wanna do is talk about you
But these tears won't let me talk about you
We should've known that we'd be lost without you
Therapy sessions, diggin' deep in depression
I got a life full of blessings, but this just breaks my fuckin' heart
At your birthday, couldn't even crack a smile
I just cried and left the party, Neesh, I'll see you in while
Headed to the mural, got some jerk wings and plantain
'Cause that is the way that me and you would celebrate it
I never knew you touched the stuff, 'cause you'd always bad me up
If you saw me more than drunk, you always hated what it does
Before Lyra, I just stopped, I haven't even wanted one
I can't get over this, it's fucked, man, I wished I'd known
And yo, we cried for nine nights in your family home
Laid you to rest in the ground but without a stone
You know it hits me most at moments now when I'm alone
Every morning, I remember that you're really gone


'Cause it's been a long night and I cry 'cause I miss my brother
You know for life, got your sis and mother
And day and night, it still hits that you're gone
And right now I'm spillin' tears in my cup
You left the world 'fore you met Jupiter
Wish you'd have known you would be godfather
You would've loved lovin' my little girls
If not for them, I'd be done with the world

Was there two hours after you passed
Speedin' east to west, silent in the back of the car
Was at your mum's, there all week, tryna make sense but I can't
And although it's been a year, still feel the pain in my heart
'Cause you were there from the start
The day we met, yeah, I moved in and we were never apart
People assumed that we were lovers, but we're brothers in arms
Symbiotic bond of love and gave each other a chance, my god, ah
Fuck sake
Lately I've been cryin' so much, my lungs ache
Teardrops all over my shirt like blood stains
And I know to heal a heart, it must break
But I'm done prayin', they
Gave me a shovel at your burial
And watchin' you get lowered is somethin' I can't forget at all
And people find and stop me in the street and say it's terrible
But they don't know you like I knew you and they never will
No one saw the nights turn into day when we were battle rappin'
No one saw the belly laugh, and every train to somewhere random
No one saw the holidays, and then our first experience clubbin'
No one knew the things you did for me and never asked for nothin'
No one read the conversations of the moves that we were plannin'
No one knew about the way you felt the scene, left you abandoned
No one knew about your fears 'cause you would hide 'em with a smile
No one knew when people took an inch, you would give 'em a mile
'Cause that was always Jamal, SB to the crowd
They used to shout your net worth, but they don't mention it now
They hear about your good deeds and infectious smile
A golden heart that's still remembered is worth more than a crown
I promised sixty-four bars and now I keep it to Tanisha
Mummy, Isaac, the gang, but I just wish that you'd seen it
I can't accept that you're gone, or the grief that I'm feeling
I prayed to God for answers, but He still won't give me a reason
I think about you every day, nothing will take this pain away
I'll keep your legacy amazin', mate
The conversations at your grave's the only way to be close
I know you'll greet me with a smile on the day that I go

'Cause it's been a long night and I cry 'cause I miss my brother
And for life, got your sis and mother
You know I cry 'cause I miss my brother
My brother was SBTV1Embed
15 TranslationsDeutschСрпскиLife Goes On Lyrics
It hit like a train, I ran out of words
I got nothing to say, everything hurts
And I know love leads to pain
But memories serve our sweetest refrain, mmm


The waves came tumbling down
As you float away, I'm reaching for ya


To tell me how, how my life goes on with you gone?
I suppose I'll sink like a stone
If you leave me now, oh, the storms will roll
Easy come, hard go, then life goes on


I miss the flames, the heated reserve
Oh, I'd remember thе way that you put me first
And what a heart-wrenching shamе
That you'll never know, just like tears in the rain, mmm


A constant grey in the clouds
When I hear your name, I think of love

So, tell me how, how my life goes on with you gone?
I suppose I'll sink like a stone
If you leave me now, oh, the storms will roll
Easy come, hard go, then life goes on


Ah, yeah, life goes on
Ah, yeah


I watched the sun setting down
I am so afraid, I need you now


To tell me how, how my life goes on with you gone?
I suppose I'll sink like a stone
If you leave me now, oh, the storms will roll
Easy come, hard go, then life goes on
Easy come, hard go, then life goes onEmbed
18 TranslationsDeutschSalt Water Lyrics
There's still so far to go and I can't feel my toes
When the rain soaks through the heels and slips to the sole
Yeah, the blades are two feet tall
I wade in green, I'm movin' forward, to where? God only knows
Feel the wind's harsh refrain like the clouds gripped my face
Saying, "It's alright to run from all this pain"
Oh, and when it's time to go with one last breath that's in my lungs
I'll scream, "It's all for love," I'll scream, "It's all for love"


Come and kiss me, salt water
Oh, finally, I feel, at three or four degrees
I'm free in salt water
Embrace the deep and leave everything
It was just a dream


I can see it up ahead where the sky meets the ground
And after that, there's only moving grey
I am filled up with regret
With things I did or never said, just leave that, well, alone


And come kiss me, salt water
Oh, finally, I feel, at three or four degrees
I'm free in salt water
Embrace the deep and leave everything
It was just a dream

(Ah-ah)
It was just a dream
It was just a dream
(Ah-ah)
It was just a dream
Was it just a dream?


Now, I'm standing on the edge, gazing into hell
Or is it somethin' else? I just can't tell
When there's nothin' left, I close my eyes and take one step
And say, "Well, here it goes," I say, "Well, here it goes"


Come and kiss me, salt water
Oh, finally, I feel, at three or four degrees
I'm free in salt water
Embrace the deep and leave everything
It was just a dreamEmbed

Across the sea by the Tennessee skyline
They told me I'd find my hopes and my dreams
But I long to be, in the bed of my true love
Back where I came from, she's waiting for me


So I'll make my way through long winding country roads
But my heart still beats for my home and my English rose



I told my dad on the phone it's amazing
From the straight to the craziest places I've seen
But I long to be, in the arms of my true love
Like he loves my mother, he understands me


I spend my days, just traveling and playing shows
But my heart still beats for my home and my English rose


I met a man in the bar down in Memphis
He told me he went there to follow his dreams
He told me "son, you know I lost my true love
For the same exact reason that you crossed the sea"

And I found truth in people I barely know
But my heart still beats for my home and my English rose


Oh, my heart still beats for my home and my English rose
Oh, my heart still beats for my home and my English rose6Embed
11 I Don’t Care (Acoustic) Lyrics
I'm at a party I don't wanna be at
And I don't ever wear a suit and tie, yeah
Wonderin' if I could sneak out the back
Nobody's even lookin' me in my eyes
And then you take my hand
Finish my drink, say, "Shall we dance?" (Hell, yeah)
You know I love ya, did I ever tell ya?
You make it better like that


Don't think I fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say (Yeah)

We're at a party we don't wanna be at
Tryna talk, but we can't hear ourselves
Read your lips, I'd rather kiss 'em right back
With all these people all around
I'm crippled with anxiety
But I'm told it's where I'm s'posed to be
You know what? It's kinda crazy 'cause I really don't mind
When you make it better like that


Don't think we fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say, oh yeah, yeah
When we walked in, I said I'm sorry, mmm
But now I think that we should stay


'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear

15 Firefly Lyrics
I fell in love next to you
Burning fires in this room
It just fits, light and smooth
Like my feet in my shoes
Little one, lie with me
Sew your heart to my sleeve
We'll stay quiet underneath
Shooting stars, if it helps you sleep


And hold me tight, don't let me breathe
Feeling like you won't believe


There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I don't feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes
There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I don't feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes


Teach my skin those new tricks
Warm me up with your lips
Heart to heart, melt me down
It's too cold in this town
Close your eyes, lean on me
Face to mouth, lips to cheek
Feeling numb in my feet
You're the one to help me get to sleep

And hold me tight, don't let me breathe
Feeling like you won't believe


There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I don't feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes
There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I don't feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes


It's only been one night of love
And maybe that is not enough
Hold me tight, don't let me breathe
Feeling like you won't believe
Only been one night of love
Maybe that is not enough
Hold me tight, don't let me breathe
Feeling like you won't believe


There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I don't feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes
There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I don't feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes9Embed
24 Be Like You Lyrics
One, two, three


Unhappy days
That left us on the floor
And you squeeze me
Till you're not feeling sure
Everything will brighten up, if we go to Brighton I'll
Take you along the pier
Everything will lighten up, and if you feel too frightened I'll
Make things disappear, dear


Darling don't be nervous
I'll understand if you let me go
I did this on purpose
Now, 'cause when I'm missing you


I'll stop eating food and I'll squeeze into a dress
So I can be like you and then I'll see your bitterness
And why you're leaving too, maybe I'll put you to a test
And say that I love you, I think that I love you


Sunny days
That left my skin dark red
And you breathe me
Till these thoughts leave my head
If it gets too complicated I'll give up and be frustrated;
Can you see what's wrong?
If you feel like you've been jaded, and this love's too overrated;
See what's going on

And darling don't be nervous
I'll understand if you let me go
I did this on purpose
Now, 'cause when I'm missing you


I'll stop eating food and I'll squeeze into a dress
So I can be like you and then I'll see your bitterness
And why you're leaving too, maybe I'll put you to a test
And say that I love you, I think that I love you


Take me back to live at home
Take me back to Albert Road


'Cause when I'm missing you
I'll stop eating food and I'll squeeze into your dress
So I can feel like you and then I'll see your bitterness
And why you left too, I thought I’d put you to a test
And say that I love you, I think that I love you
And I'll stop eating food and I'll squeeze into your dress
So I can feel like you and then I'll see your bitterness
And why you left me too, I thought I’d put you to a test
And say that I love you, now it seems you loved me too11Embed
19 Spark Lyrics
We've been lost for a long time
In a rut, no escape signs
And, for love, we were so blind
Oh, I hate to see you cry
There've been times where the truth lied
Now, it's clear as a blue sky


Like a Band-Aid over deeper cuts, we tried
We couldn't stop the fate descending on the night


We'll build a fire and torch our old lives
And hope the spark survives
Use words as kindling, light up the night sky
Let the memories take flight
And hope the spark survives


Yeah, we hope the spark survives


Oh, I wonder, will we pull through?
All we ever do is argue
With not a lot, but we make do
How I wish you wouldn't say that
There are things you can't take back
When you leave, I always face facts

Like a hand that's trying to hold the water back
We couldn't stop the ocean leaking in the cracks


We'll build a fire and torch our old lives
And hope the spark survives
Use words as kindling, light up the night sky
Let the memories take flight
And hope the spark survives


Yeah, we hope the spark survives


We've taken roads (Oh, we've taken roads)
That led to confusion
But right now, that don't matter at all (Na-na)
We'll bring it back (Yeah, we'll bring it back)
Our love's no illusion
The higher we go, the harder we fall, and now


We'll build a fire and torch our old lives
And hope the spark survives
Use words as kindling, light up the night sky
Let the memories take flight
And hope the spark survives

Yeah, we hope the spark survives
And we hope the spark survivesEmbed
17 TranslationsСрпскиEnd Of Youth Lyrics
I've been depressed since you left, tried to fill the hole with wine
Stopped the drugs when she came, cleaned my act up overnight
If you reach with no reply, I'll see you when I see you, man
You can't talk me through the fall if we don't know if I can land
Tried to grow, but the past, it tears me down to size
Tell the world how to process, but don't take the same advice
Half remember what I say, then the morning's filled with fear
Can't get a handle on my grief when every memory turns to tears


It's been a long year and we're not even halfway there


Is this the endin' of our youth when pain starts takin' over?
I just don't know if I can ever just let it go
Everything's fallin' apart, when love is real, there's never closure
I guess it's all part of life, but I can't help but feel low


We spend our youth with arms and hearts wide open
And then the dark gets in and that's the end of youth


I've been lost since the teens, but pretend it's all alright
All my ups led to falls that led to trying to end my life
Just a boy at the start, they lent on like a man
You were meant to be my friend and not to take all that you can
Disengaged to create, try to reinvent the wheel
No one knows what they want, so I just give you what I feel
If I slip and get high, I know the low is always near
When I'm down, I never see you, when I'm up, you all appear

It's been a long year and we're not even halfway there


Is this the endin' of our youth when pain starts takin' over?
I just don't know if I can ever just let it go
Everything's fallin' apart, when love is real, there's never closure
I guess it's all part of life, but I can't help but feel low


We spend our youth with arms and hearts wide open
And then the dark gets in and that's the end of youth


Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh


It's been a long year and we're not even halfway there


Is this the endin' of our youth when pain starts takin' over?
I just don't know if I can ever just let it go
Everything's fallin' apart, when love is real, there's never closure
I guess it's all part of life, but I can't help but feel low

We spend our youth with arms and hearts wide open
And then the dark gets in and that's the end of youth
We spend our youth with arms and hearts wide open
And then the dark gets in and that's the end of youthEmbed

I am a poor, wayfaring stranger
Traveling through this world alone
And there's no sickness, toil, or danger

And I'm only going over Jordan

13 Everything You Are Lyrics
I didn't mean to break your heart, I was just lonely
And everybody falls apart sometimes
I know you found another one
But won't you just hold me tonight?
I wish I never called you up, and nobody told me
And they don't know we don't speak anymore
So take a good look at us
And won't you just hold me tonight?


And I will stop trying to fall in love again and keep it a secret
It never works out anyway
But I am not anything like I was
'Cause you are the only one for me, yeah


'Cause maybe I don't wanna lose a lover and a friend
In one night, if that's alright
I shouldn't have fucked with your mind
And your life too many times
Oh, maybe I don't wanna be lonely
Darling, you are my only love
Behind my truth lies
Everything you are

I never meant to sleep around, I was just lonely
And you did the same, again and again and again, woah, I know
So here's to the both of us
Here's to our story tonight


Oh, I will stop trying to fall in love again and keep it a secret
It never works out anyway
But I am not anything like I was
'Cause you are the only one for me, hmm, yeah


And maybe I don't wanna lose a lover and a friend
In one night, if that's alright
I shouldn't have fucked with your mind
And your life too many times
Oh, maybe I don't wanna be lonely
Darling, you are my only love
Behind my truth lies
Everything you are


When I see my future, it is with you
And we'll get there
And I want my children to be with you
And we'll get there, hmm, yeah

'Cause maybe I don't wanna lose a lover and a friend

15 TranslationsDeutschI Will Remember You Lyrics
I will remember you
In the way you'd want me to
But it's hard to come to terms right now
Sunset looked today
As if it knew you'd gone away
Now it's night, I hear the rain crash down


Oh, I'd cry, but this is more than just my pain
Oh, I could be a shoulder, not a burden
And it's time for me to call your son again
And say


She was the starlight in darkness
She was the first bloom in spring
An angel with a smile like electric light
All the time, hit her wings
She was the birdsong in morning
But now everything here has changed
All the world's less beautiful
Since you've been away


I will remember you
With white wine by the barbecue
On New York at the birthday do, downtown
All that comes to mind
When I think about the time
Is a memory of laughin' out loud

Oh, I wish, that I could take the pain away
And just talk to him in person
But it's time for me to call your son again
And say


She was the starlight in darkness
She was the first bloom in spring
An angel with a smile like electric light
All the time, hit her wings
She was the birdsong in morning
But now everything here has changed
All the world's less beautiful
Since you've been away


This doesn't make sense
I wish I could change it, but
I can't do anything
My heart is racin'
And my soul is achin', lover


She was the starlight in darkness
She was the first bloom in spring
An angel with a smile like electric light
All the time, hit her wings
She was the birdsong in morning
But now everything here has changed
All the world's less beautiful
Since you've been away

Hey, the world's less beautiful

3 We Found Love LyricsYellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive

It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Shine a light through an open door
Love and life I will divide
Turn away cause I need you more
Feel the heart beat in my mind

It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go


We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless placeEmbed
14 Dusty Lyrics
I heard you callin', now my eyes are open
The day is breakin' into powder blue
Sunlight is framin' our every moment
What a way to start off the day with you


Flick a finger
Start a discussion to pick a singer
This one, you'll love it, I had to bring her
Just let the speakers take you away


And drop the needle on Dusty
Frost on the leaves like a lake
The moment came out of nothin'
A beautiful smile on your face
Yesterday was a long night
But I got a feeling that the future is so bright
All of the pressure washed away in the low tide
But we gotta wait till our clothes are bone dry
So I'll drop the needle on Dusty


We were lost within a stormy ocean
Nobody knew what we were going through
We talk about it as we dip our toes in
Take a breath and brace for the waves with you

Flick a finger
Wait for the magic to do its thing, yeah
There's more than sadness we got within us
Let's put some colour into the grey


And drop the needle on Dusty
Frost on the leaves like a lake
The moment came out of nothin'
A beautiful smile on your face
Yesterday was a long night
But I got a feeling that the future is so bright
All of the pressure washed away in the low tide
But we gotta wait till our clothes are bone dry
So I'll drop the needle on Dusty


Nothing static on the stereo before today (Before today)
Both on the edge to throw it all away (Throw it all away)
I used to think that every situation stayed the same (The same)
But I can see it start to change (Start to change), okay


Drop the needle on Dusty
Frost on the leaves like a lake
The moment came out of nothin'
A beautiful smile on your face
Yesterday was a long night
But I got a feeling that the future is so bright
All of the pressure washed away in the low tide
But we gotta wait till our clothes are bone dry
So I'll drop the needle on Dusty

Drop the needle on Dusty
Drop the needle on DustyEmbed

Mm-mm-mm
Rrr, Cuz, Cuz, Cuz, Cuz
Teddyphotos


Känns som hennes hjärta sitter åt höger
Och när hon kommer, vet exakt vad hon söker
Jag behöver ingen stress, kallar hellre henne ex
Mannen, fuck alla ex
Hon vet jag älskar hela orten för mycket, mannen
Two-steppin' med den dära favorittabben
Älskar 180 lukten lika mycket som 450'n i luften
Finns en grej med tugget


'Cause we're livin' life at a different pacе, stuck in a constant race
Keep the pressurе on, you're bound to break, something's got to change
We should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn
If we're missin' out on what the people think is right
Seein' through a picture behind the screen and forget to be
Lose the conversation for the message that you'll never read
I think maybe you and me
Oh, we should head out to the place where the music plays
And then

We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone, then loved
And all we need is us to go all


Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us


It's like a bad dream
I thought that me and you was to meant to see the seven seas
Why would you let somebody between us?
Now I got many reasons for it not to be us
E-E-E-Every time dark night rises, you're my sunshine
Tell me what goes up that doesn't go down
We're supposed to go up, but she's too cold now
Why she even play me, are you crazy? Oh
Our love is a different type of drug
She made a gangster fall in love
I feel dumb and my heart is numb
You wanna get affection from a thug, hey
1.Cuz and Ed Sheeran, who would even fucking believe me?
Now they fiending to see me

We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low, then up, alone, then loved
And all we need is us to go all


Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us to go all night
Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah

24 Let It Out Lyrics
You give me life and a loss of oxygen
You treat me like I was in love again
And I hold you tight, tight enough to know
That you are mine, I'd never let you go


And it's you I miss
And it's you I miss


So let it out
I let it out now
I let it out
I let it out now, now


And you speak to me behind your darkened stare
And you let me be as if I wasn't there


It seemed perfect, a concept free from any regret
Another couple based on teen sex
You eejit, true I was just like you
We couldn't be torn apart, you see we were just like glue

It's you I miss
And it's you I miss, oh-oh


So let it out
I let it out now
I let it out
I let it out now, now


It seemed perfect, a concept free from any regret
Another couple based on teen sex
You eejit, true I was just like you
We couldn't be torn apart, you see we were just like glue


Like glue, we're like glue, we're like glue
Like glue, we're like glue, we're like glue
Like glue, we're like glue, we're like glue
Like glue, we're like glue, we're like glue

14 So Lyrics
I'm filled up with doubt
I have to move home
But I want to stay with you for all of the summer
I have my plan that you won't remember
If you want to see the world, then, please, ask your mother


I cannot hold your hand to watch you go
Oh, I am a liar, as you might know


I need you now
I need your touch and your lips
I need your smile and your kiss


'Cause you're so cool
You're so beautiful
You're so... and you're so...
You're so cool
You're so beautiful
You're so... and you're so...


Hmm-hmm-hmmm-hmmmm
Hmm-hmm-hmmm-hmm

I see your voice
And from my window
When it is late at night it'll show me your shadow
I have my plan that you won't remember
If you want to see the world and, please, ask your mother
Now, ah-oh-ah-oh


I cannot hold your hand, to watch you go
Oh, I'm a liar, as you might know


I need you now
I need your touch and your lips
I need that smile and your kiss

17 Sofa Lyrics
She's reinventing loving me
When we're resembling cutlery on the sofa
It must have been about 5:01 like my blue ripped jeans
And my eyes are closed and I'm way too tired
Hoodie still smells of the beach bonfire
On the sofa, where we lay
I wanna stay inside all day


And it's cold outside again
And we're both so high


We could fly to Berlin, Tokyo or Jamaica
We can go where you want, say the word and I'll take ya
But I'd rather stay on the sofa, on the sofa
On the sofa with you


When the morning comes
We're not watching Formula 1
It's not what we breathe for
So kick off the day with Friends on T4
Two, boiled and brew
Two sugars ain't too sweet for you
On the sofa, where we lay
I wanna stay inside all day

And it's cold outside again
And we're still so high


We could fly to Berlin, Tokyo or Jamaica
We can go where you want, say the word and I'll take ya
But I'd rather stay on the sofa
On the sofa with you


And it feels like I'm flying
And it feels like


We could go to Berlin, Tokyo or Jamaica
Through the streets of New York, that is where I will take ya
Paris, Rome, to Rio, passing through Las Vegas
We can go where you want, say the word and I'll take ya
But I'd rather stay on the sofa, on the sofa
On the sofa with you8Embed
14 Curtains Lyrics
Can you pull the curtains? Let me see the sunshine
I think I'm done with my hidin' place and you found me anyway
It's been forever, but I'm feelin' alright
Tears dry and will leave no trace and tomorrow's another day


Hide and seek, I am somewhere closed away
You won't believe how long it's been since I started the game
I can't be seen and you won't find me today
I've not been this low, but I'll be okay


"Are you alright?" Maybe don't ask
'Cause you know I never like to talk about that
Keep it inside, yeah, you say I always hold back
And I always wear long sleeves
Is it in your childhood? Somethin' happen in your past?
Well, the sadness, yeah, I promise that it won't last
And if I could, I would try to take it all back
There's still more underneath and that's when you say to me


"Can you pull the curtains? Let me see the sunshine
I think I'm done with my hidin' place and you found me anyway
It's been forever, but I'm feelin' alright
Tears dry and will leave no trace and tomorrow's another day"

Let me see the sunshine, shine, shine
Let me see the sunshine, shine, shine
Let me see the sunshine, shine, shine
Let me see the sunshine


Hide and seek, count to ten and close your eyes
Try to breathe, see a message and don't reply
Nice to meet, but in reality, say goodbye
Life can be so beautiful if you try


"Are you okay?" Yeah, I guess so
But on some days, I feel like I'm trapped in a hole
But I keep quiet, so the ones around me don't know
That the mountain feels so steep
And I'll say that I'm here to help to carry the load
And the outside rays, they are good for the soul
So, let's step out of the dark 'cause, in here, it's so cold
The day's not out of reach and that's when you say to me


"Can you pull the curtains? Let me see the sunshine
I think I'm done with my hidin' place and you found me anyway
It's been forever but I'm feelin' alright
Tears dry and will leave no trace and tomorrow's another day"

Let me see the sunshine, shine, shine
Let me see the sunshine, shine, shine
Let me see the sunshine, shine, shine
Let me see the sunshineEmbed
16 The Hills of Aberfeldy Lyrics
Oh, the leaves are covered in snow
And the water's frozen
Oh, I long for you to be the one that I'm holdin'
And warm me down to my bones
As you lay beside me, hold me close
Oh, the leaves are starting to fall
And the sun grows cold
And my heart might break from the weight of it all
For all that I know
You could be holding somebody else as close


And when I'm home, I'll hold you like I'm supposed to
Yet I know that I have never told you
Darling, we could fall in lovе 'neath the hills of Aberfеldy


Oh, the ground is slowly melting
And the sun beats strong
And I feel like my feet may have wandered too long
And I will remain here alone
'Cause I fear that you may have found someone


And when I'm home, I'll hold you like I'm supposed to
Yet I know that I have never told you
But darling, we could fall in love 'neath the hills of Aberfeldy
Darling, we could fall in love 'neath the hills of Aberfeldy

Wherever I go, I will always find
Another stranger to share in the weight of my crimes
And I know you will never find
Another heart that wants you more than mineEmbed

8 Fall Lyrics
You and I
Two of a mind
This love's, one of a kind
You and I
We’re drifting
Over the edge


And I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
If I fall for you
Would you fall too?


You and I
We’re learning to speak
With kisses on cheeks
You and I
We’re lifted
Over the edge


And I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
If I fall for you
Would you fall too?
And I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
If I fall for you
Would you fall too?

Would you fall too?
Would you fall too?
Would you fall too?
Would you fall too?6Embed
14 Colourblind Lyrics
Kaleidoscope love, yeah, that is you and me
Forever changing, we make life interesting
Some days, we're red and some days, we both think green
But I like the nights when we leave the canvas free


Grab a brush and see where the feelin' may lead
Nothin' is out of our reach
Our words are mixing the pigment we need
Can we get started?


I keep fallin' deeper in dark blue
Brighter than white, rainbows exploding
But I can't see nothin' еxcept you and your eyes
Maybе we'll just paint the night colourblind


In every spectrum, we find the millionth piece
Connect the dots and everything in between
Mmm, dull in the moment, you'll turn it golden leaf
You take the dark away and that's no easy feat


Pick an orange, watch the shade change in the heat
From yellow, purple and green
Your words are mixin' each pigment we need
Can we get started?

I keep falling deeper in dark blue
Brighter than white, rainbows exploding
But I can't see nothin' except you and your eyes
Maybe we'll just paint the night colourblind


Mmm
Maybe we'll just paint the night colourblindEmbed
15 Vega Lyrics
Rain keeps beating on the rooftop, muddying the glass
But, God, I love the sound of heaven
Sat cross-legged on the carpet
Listenin' to vinyl, trying to ignore the weather


This week was heavy, I buckled under all the weight
What can you do, but pray?
And count your blessings, it wasn't any other way
Don't leave it up to fate


Fighting the tide, but the waves, they will part
Light up the night, we were made to be stars
But it burns like hell to be Vega


Clouds keep forming over this house
Blocking out the sun, I'm trying to keep it all together
One door closes then one opens, gotta keep the focus
If we believe, then she'll get better


The days are long, but they pass within an instant, babe
It is the strangest thing
I'll count my blessings the day I see you smile again
This war we've got to win

Keep it inside, don't let no one see your heart
No one can judge, we're the same in the dark
Fighting the tide, but the waves, they will part
Light up the night, we were made to be stars
But it burns like hell to be Vega


Same problems, different options
Pain comes at a cost, but we've got this
Need rest, bite, bleed time dry
She'll be fine, she'll be fine
Same problems, different options
Pain comes at a cost, but we've got this
Need rest, bite, bleed time dry
She'll be fine, she'll be fine


Rain keeps beating on the rooftop, worrying to death
But I guess this is human nature
We are meant to shine like stars, but
That don't mean it don't burn like hell to be VegaEmbed
15 TranslationsРусскийRomanizationShivers (Remix) Lyrics
I took an arrow to the heart
I never kissed a mouth that tastes like yours
Strawberries and a somethin' more
Ooh, yeah, I want it all
Ударю по струнам
Ты сводишь меня с ума
Когда ты танцуешь под это, вот это да
Я помню тот вечер и тот переулок
Влюбились друг в друга и встретили утро


И встретили утро
Мы встретили утро, я
Влюбились в друг друга
Мы встретили утро
Мы встретили утро, е, а


Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back
And we'll say, "Ooh!"


— У! Или не… или как?
— У-у
— У
— Блин, как он это делает, я не понимаю. У, у-у, у-у, у-у. Блин
— У
— А-а-а

У, я кажется влюбляюсь в тебя
Когда ты рядом моё тело всё в мурашках
Baby, у
Она танцует до утра
И пока город засыпает едем дальше


Into the car
On the backseat in the moonlit dark
Wrap me up between your legs and arms
Ooh, I can't get enough
Е, а, пробегусь по клавишам, ударю по струнам
Ты сводишь меня с ума, когда под это танцуешь
И самый первый поцелуй где-то в городских переулках
Мы любили друг друга всю ночь, да, и встретили утро


Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back
And we'll say, "Ooh!"
У, я кажется влюбляюсь в тебя
Когда ты рядом моё тело всё в мурашках
Baby, у
Она танцует до утра
И пока город засыпает едем дальше
У, я кажется влюбляюсь в тебя
Когда ты рядом моё тело всё в мурашках

26 Lately Lyrics
I seem to find myself talking to the powers that be
Awaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees
Admiring the scene, inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe
Jet lagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep
Although my bloodshot whites and irises they never find any
Clock stops at times where the sun shine can blind many
Although my eyes are heavy, they won't be closing soon
Cause I heard that time waits for nobody, I suppose it's true
We make corrosive tunes with acid tabs and vocal booths
To see the flashing lights at photo shoots, we make our motive moves
I say whatever I feel to vent a rhyme
So I can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine
Cause real recognise real is what my father says
And I'll be sticking to this phrase until I pass away
Overworking, no sleep is just another way to die slow
But I'll just keep going strong and never let my eyes close


5 o'clock with lights off, interview with a vampire
Sleep is for the living and not a utensil that I require
I swear I said, that I'll sleep when I'm dead
Who's on the beat upon the feature with Ed?
It's D-E-V to the Zed
Over tired, pale faced like Michael Myers
Bags underneath my eyes can show the baggage I've acquired
And over the time within this maze I think you'll find you'll
Never find that peace of mind you seek to find until you're dying
Cause I got too much to stay awake for
To sleep, or even take four seconds out the game, it's time to wage war
Scissors, grab a sword, and sharpen up your hunting knives
Two psychopathic lyricists are driving on the hunt tonight
I'm hailing from the Essex and the East London border line
Villans never sleep, they mastermind in all sorts of crimes
Be wide awake just like you're snorting lines
Or get left mortified like you just seen the ghost of Jesus walking by

I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free
It could be
The times I'm living in
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free
It could be
The times I'm living in lately


I brush my teeth every night but still I wake up with a bad mouth
And the background is my past and my presence will bring it back out
Deliver the raps how I flow, I live with the rats now and those
That hate me call me Ron but they won't slither in too easy
Believe me I'm snake minded, be within this great time, be
On minimum wage, life is a prison escape that I'm in
It's all to do with timing not the label that you sign with
Then my mates are doing fine but then they never put the time in
I try to hide my cold side like when I flip my pillows
Some of the songs I write are real because the charts are filled with si-li-cone
I'm still broke without the money for a Mac Pro
Living out of three bags, no talk about my cash flow
Opposite of sober cause I never did my homework
Which has got me on the sofa, no degree but growing older
I played a fool to catch the wise, I will never tell a lie
I wake dead, take deep breaths, try to never die (never die)

Two guys with the same view, keep it tight like Scrooge
Making metaphors flow and move, like typhoons and tunes
And if we got our eyes on you, we'll catch you while you snooze
Times elapsing while you're catching Zed's, the masses like to move
We scan the situation, analyse information
And then decide what probably is most practical to do
Driven young gentlemen, I've hardly changed my bed sheets
At all over the last 12 months cause I haven't slept in 'em, true
I'm coming home, the lights are on, your rights are wrong, so I'm correcting 'em
We got the fans all like, "Oh wow it's Devs and Ed"
What less did you bloody expect from 'em?"
In the end sleep deprivation might just be our detriment
Fighting through writers block from 9 o'clock to 5 o'clock
And no way will I ever waste a second of the time I got
I keep my pupils engaged
Like a classroom in holy matrimony, but I'm only trying to stay awake


I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free
It could be
The times I'm living in
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free
It could be
The times I'm living in lately
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free
It could be
The times I'm living in
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free
It could be
The times I'm living in lately3Embed
15 Borderline Lyrics
Sadness always finds an in
Sneaks its way past, infecting everything
And every chapter has an end
But this is one momentous sequel, don't you think?


And the blackbirds, they fly
Like a frown on the skyline


Right now, I feel I'm runnin' from the light
Engulfed in darkness, shielded from my eyes
One foot in, one out, I'm stuck on the borderline
Which way will I?


Guess I should take this on the chin
But I don't even know how all of this began
And we are made to mould and bend
How can I wish for nothing when it's still a sin?


And right now, I feel I'm runnin' from the light
Engulfed in darkness, shielded from my eyes
One foot in, one out, I'm stuck on the borderline
Which way will I?
Tears never arrive, these ducts are dry
We are so blind waiting on the borderline
Waiting on the borderline

So I will pour another drink
And try to drown the pain with salt along the rim
And I'll shut off the things I think
'Cause nothing good will ever come from worrying


Right now, I feel I'm runnin' from the light
Engulfed in darkness, shielded from my eyes
One foot in, one out, I'm stuck on the borderline
Which way will I?
Tears never arrive, these ducts are dry
We are so blindEmbed
13 No Strings Lyrics
If we make it through this year
Then nothin' can break us
Trouble leaves, then reappears
But we've shown we can take it


We tear our hair out and overthink it
Work and get burnt out


But this is no strings, you are who I love
And that won't change when we're fallin' apart
Yeah, this is no strings, you are who I love
It's just growin' pains


If we make it through this year
We should celebrate it
Rarified atmosphere
Till now, we evaded


We tore the walls down to build them up
Never was in doubt

'Cause this is no strings, you are who I love
And that won't change when we're fallin' apart
Yeah, this is no strings, you are who I love
It's just growin' pains


We did not fight for love
Just to let it be defeated
What we're goin' through is common
But doesn't mean we don't feel it
It would be easy just to give it up
Guess we've got enough reasons
But every time that we have come undone


I'll say, "It's no strings, you are who I love
And that won't change when we're fallin' apart
Yeah, this is no strings, you are who I love
It's just growin' pains"Embed
10 You Need Me, I Don’t Need You (Live at the Bedford) Lyrics
Now I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show
Every night in front of a new crowd
That's new now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus, as I sing to you loud
And I can't, no, I won`t hush
I'll say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now
See, I'm true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me


Cause you need me, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you (at all)
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you (at all)
You need me

I sing and write my own tune and I write my own verse, hell
Don't need another word-smith to make my tune sell
Call yourself a singer-writer you're just bluffing
Your names on the credits and you didn't write nothing
I sing fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to Brit School
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can't last if I'm smoking on a crack pipe
And I won't be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia
And musically I'm demonstrating
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the Enterprise when some fella filmed me
A young singer-writer like a Gabriella Cilmi


Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, (at all)
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, (at all)
You need me

All I want in this cold world is to make music and use it
Not to abuse it and get affected, infected with the who's who of music
Who did it, who is it, who's in it or what the hell does it matter?
Chitter chatter, don't matter what a yidder, yidder, yadder, it don't matter to me
All I want is a bit of dignity in me to battle this industry freely
To be me in this seedy, needy world, can you hear me?
Hey, so I keep singing that
When I first started this rapping shit I felt pressure from haters
Became invaded with sadists and just developed a hater radar
And made for the stars, kept my grind in the dark
And then appeared with a remedy kicking rhymes with a melody
Hennesey shots and... all these fools on the block
Who said you gotta be a gangster now to raise to the top?
I'm just a normal, casual, usual, everyday type of guy...
My head in the sky... Ready to die
Ed Sheeran, Alone Star
Coming out here freestyling with the guitar
Cause I've forgotten the lyrics of this bit right here
So I freestyle off the top of the bit with the...


You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Mummy I've got the X if you're into taking drugs
Into having sex, I ain't into making love
Come give me a hug if you're into getting rough
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bubbly
Mummy I've got the X if you're into taking drugs
Into having sex, I ain't into making love
Come give me a hug if you're into getting rough

My eyes are red, I've been burning, I've been burning
My eyes are red, I've been burning, I've been burning
My eyes are red I've been burning, I've been burning on a spliff off your high grade
My eyes are red I've been burning, I've been burning, burning, burning


Now where I come from burning weed it is a habit
A big fat bag of high grade weed, you know I got to have it
Cos if I don't have it in my pocket I'm going to panic
Cos like I said where I come from weed smoking is a habit
Yup, we'll do da bun in the place up in the hood
One of them things I have inherited like a ghetto man should
One of them things is smoking weed it yes it makes me feel good
Burning high grade sensimilla, yes it makes me feel
But me is a man, ah, talk about sensimilla is a drug
And if I start to smoke it I'mma-nna turn into a thug
Where I come from that they talking could that only get you mugged
Where I come from burning weed it is a blessing from above
Where I come from yes we bun it when we listen rub a dub
Where I come from yes we bun after we just-a make a love
Where I come from yes we bun it when the sun starts shine
I blaze high grade weed all the time!
Now my eyes are red


Now my eyes are red
Cause you need me, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
And you need me, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man, I don't need you


Okay so this is the breakdown bit where we get a little bit funky. Ugh, and I forget about the whole week, you forget about the whole week, the whole weekend. Just forget about everything! 'Cause it's Sunday and we're all gonna get drunk after this and have a very, very good time and I'm not stressed anymore. We're just letting it unwind. I wanna split the room in the middle here. Who's up for that? Not, not, not literally. You don't have to literally divide. It's all good, all good. Peace and love, peace and love and harmony. What was I gonna say? This side, up there, are you with me? This side, up there, are you with me? Everyone scream as loud as you can! (screaming) Okay, so we found out that everyone's voices work. This side, I'm not gonna insult you but you are West Ham, okay? You're West Ham, yeah? You're West Ham Football Club. Get in the geezer mode, yeah? This side, you're Millwall, yeah? You two, you two hate each other. You two are gonna beat each other at whatever you do, no matter what. So if I give you something to sing, you have to sing louder than them. If I give you something to sing, you have to sing louder than them. Are you all up for that? Millwall, are you ready? (yeah!) West Ham, are you ready? (yeah!) Okay, West Ham, you sing this...

You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you

Millwall, you sing this:
My eyes are red!
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, my eyes are red!
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, (my eyes are red!)
(You need me, man, I don't need you)
(You need me, man, my eyes are red!)
You need me, man, I don't need you
Millwall are winning I think


I seem to find myself talking to the powers that be
Awaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees
Admiring the scene, inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe
Jet lagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep
Although my bloodshot whites and irises they never find any
Clock stops at times where the sun shine can blind many
Although my eyes are heavy, they won't be closing soon

You need me, man, I don't need you


I got my friend, very good friend Random Impulse. He's gonna come up and he's gonna spit a few bars on the beat. Everyone give it up for Random Impulse!


Yo!
In this game, I am my own damn man, no restriction, post or boundaries
Spouting heat, hungry and my circle always round to eat
Crossing circles, counting thousands at a thousand feet
Counting sheep and he's sound asleep
Summoned from the deep, now I float, to sink my boat, you'll need a thousand fleets
Walk on any beat and stomp it like a thousand feet
Talk is cheap, so I could treat you to my words for free
Now that I'm out, man, I ain't playing like I hurt my knee
It's common courtesy, I left you for a minute
Now I'm back and packing punches like I'm Popeye popping spinach
Eating every course... lunch, I ain't forgotten dinners
Play guitars as well as bars so you ain't rocking with beginners
Sorry, time's ticking, I can't mess with up-and-comers
National lottery business, only winners have my numbers
Man I'm nothing like you fronters, show you how it is
I can't really do nothing for you 'less you got something to give, Ed!


Cause you need me, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
And you need me, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me


I'll keep my last name forever keep the genre pretty basic
Gonna be breaking into other peoples tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rappers shoes using new laces
Selling CD's from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling CD's from my rucksack aiming for the majors
Nationwide tour with just jack, still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago
But more people hear me though
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos
I'm always doing shows if I'm not I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up call me Ruffio
Melody music maker
Reading all the papers
They say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator
Later!
Thank you... thank you so much! See you soon!Embed
9 Toughest Lyrics
I don't know what to think
The workout through the day
The doctor said it's cancer
And a baby is on the way
Life changes in a blink
Decisions to be made
They say radio's the answer
And that both lives can be saved


Points for timing, it cannot get worse
What the hell are we going to do?
But you're the type to defeat the hardest obstacles
Put in front of you


You are the toughest in the room
And I know that love will get us through
And life will overcome the pain that grows in you
'Cause you are thе toughest in the room
You show me strеngth I never knew
When love is on our side, there's just no way to lose
But I still can't help but break down


Still waiting on a call
Then an action plan is made
In the middle of a court case
Shows what really matters, babe
The specialist is enough
En route, we'll choose our child's name
'Cause we had enough surprises
For a lifetime, wouldn't you say?

The word he said, it had the utmost power
To change the world to blue
But you're the type to defeat the hardest obstacles
Put in front of you


You are the toughest in the room
And I know that love will get us through
And life will overcome the pain that grows in you
'Cause you are the toughest in the room
You show me strength I never knew
When love is on our side, there's just no way to lose
But I still can't help but break down


All night long
Tossin' and turnin' and beggin'
Please, hold on


'Cause you are the toughest in the room
I know that love will get us through
And life will overcome the pain that grows in you
'Cause you are the toughest in the room
You show me strength I never knew
When love is on our side, there's just no way to lose
But I still can't help but break downEmbed
14 Sycamore Lyrics
Sycamore in the summer bearing leaves
Swing, you're pushin' our daughter underneath
Flowers bloom in the garden, sway in breeze
Just imagine a world where we could be


Right now, in the waiting room, emotions runnin' wild
Worried 'bout my lover and I'm worried 'bout our child
And part of me was always in denial, it's gonna take a little while


But in our story, love in, love out
And we are glorious
Well, in our story, love in, love out
And we are glorious


Sycamore bringing shade from beating sun
Nothin' more than a word, a smoking gun
What a puzzlе is this to be in love
To be planting your roots, thеn dig them up


Waiting on professionals to tell you how it is
What's he gonna say after "I think you better sit"?
Brace yourself, something's about to hit
It's gonna take a little while

Well, in our story, love in, love out
And we are glorious
Well, in our story, love in, love out
And we are glorious
Well, in our story, love in, love out
And we are glorious
Well, in our story, love in, love out
And we are glorious


Sycamore in the field, a lonely tree
Darlin', what will become of you and me?Embed
12 Moving Lyrics
This is the last song I'm writin' 'bout you
Up to now, well, I'd never tried to
You don't feel any kind of pain like I do
So let's forget it even happened, babe
You're all I thought about whenever I woke
Then all I'd talk about whenever I spoke
All I'd sing when I would hit the high notes
But now it doesn't even matter


If you come back
It's like we never even had that
Every moment when you took my joy away
All the memoriеs mean nothin' from today
Up to now, I never hold back
Truе emotion made me feel sad
But I never wanna hear your name again
And go back to how it was before you came


Start movin' on, movin' on
I feel on a roll since you've been gone
Start movin' on, movin' on
Out of my life, life, where you belong

This is the last time I'm thinkin' 'bout you
I used to cry, but then, was it a crime too?
I spent a lifetime tryna make the right moves
And got myself caught in a pattern, babe
You take a smile and then you turn it to dust
You take what's golden and you, somehow, make rust
Every lie, it made it harder to trust
But now it doesn't even matter


If you come back
It's like we never even had that
Every moment when you took my joy away
All the memories mean nothin' from today
Up to now, I never hold back
True emotion made me feel sad
But I never wanna hear your name again
And go back to how it was before you came


Start movin' on, movin' on
I feel on a roll since you've been gone
Start movin' on, movin' on
Out of my life, life, where you belong

Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do (Hey)
Do-do-do-do-do (Hey, ooh)
Doo-doo-doo (Hey)
Do-do-do-do-do


Start movin' on, movin' on
I feel on a roll since you've been gone
Start movin' on, movin' on
Out of my life, life, where you belongEmbed
28 Bad Habits (Remix) Lyrics
Ooh, ooh


Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful


My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true
My bad habits lеad to you


(Woah-ooh, ooh-ooh
Woah-ooh, ooh-ooh)


Every pure intention еnds when the good times start
Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
It started under neon lights and then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Well, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you


Woah-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Woah-ooh, ooh-ooh
Woah-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Woah-ooh, ooh-ooh


We took the long way 'round
And burned till the fun ran out
We took the long way 'round
And burned till the fun ran out, now


My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to you

Woah-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Woah-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you, you!
Bad habits lead to you!
Know it's true, my bad habits lead to you!7Embed
10 Shape of You / XO TOUR Llif3 2017 VMAs Lyrics


The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like


Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead (Everybody, sing it loud)


I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like


Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead (VMAs, sing it loud, hey)


I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new (Uzi)
I'm in love with the shape of you

Come on, come on be my baby
Come on, I can't wait for long
You know I love your body but I hate that you a star
No, I do not really need you 'cause you know I ball
(I'm in love with your body)
Yeah, I'm in love with the shape of you
No, it do not matter if you're skinny or you're tall
If you're thicker than a snicker or you're small
Get the picture when I kiss you
Diamonds gleaming, they be shining on my wrist (My wrist)
And I don't know why they be always acting bitter (I don't know)
'Cause they know that I'm the one that's gonna get her




I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you shoulda never lied
Shoulda saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said, "Baby, I am not afraid to die"
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge

Phantom that's all red, inside all white
Like somethin' you ride a sled down, I just want that head
My Brittany got mad, I'm barely her man now
Everybody got the same swag now
Watch the way that I tear it down
Stackin' my bands all the way to the top
All the way 'til my bands fallin' over
Every time that you leave your spot
Your girlfriend call me like, "Come on over!"
I like the way that she treat me
Gon' leave you, won't leave me, I call it that Casanova
She say I'm insane, yeah
I might blow my brain out
Xanny, help the pain, yeah
Please, Xanny, make it go away
I'm committed, not addicted, but it keep control of me
All the pain, now I can't feel it
I swear that it's slowin' me, yeah


I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you shoulda never lied
Saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said: "I am not afraid to die."
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead, yeah
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead, yeah
All my friends are dead, yeah2Embed
4 You Need Me, I Don’t Need You - Live and in Session Lyrics
Now I'm in town, break it down
Thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night
In front of a new crowd
That's you now, ciao
Seems that life is great now
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud
I can't, no I won't hush
I'll say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now
See, I'm true
My songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue
I stick to other artists
I'm not you
No, that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing
And move to greener pastures
See, I'm real, I do it all, It's all me
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put
Give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me
Hey

You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you

You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man


I sing, I write my own tunes
And I write my own verse, hell
Don't need another wordsmith
To make my tune sell
Call yourself a singer writer
You're just bluffing
Name's on the credits
And you didn't write nothing
I sing fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to Brit school
I came fast with the way I act right
I can't last if I'm smoking on a crack pipe
And I won't be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia
And musically I'm demonstrating
When I perform live feels like I am meditating
Times at the Enterprise when some fella filmed me
Young singer/writer like a Gabriella Cilmi

You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you

You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man


Cause you need me, man I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you

My eyes are red, I've been burning, I've been burning
My eyes are red, I've been burning, I've been burning out
My eyes are red, I've been burning
I've been burning on a spliff of your high-grade
My eyes are red, I've been burning
I've been burning burning burning


Now, where I come burning weed it is a habit
A big fat bag of high-grade weed you know I got to have it
Cause if I don't have it in my pocket I'm going to panic
Cause like I say where I come from weed smoking is a habit
Yeah do da burn up the place up in the hood
One of the things that I've inherited
Like a ghetto man you should
One of the things is smoking weed
Yes it makes me feel good
But high-grade sensimilla, yes it makes me feel
Mommy, yes I'm gonna table sensimilla is a drug
And If I start to smoke I'm gonna turn into a thug
Where I come from all that talking
It could only get you mugged
Where I come from burning weed
It is a blessing from above
Where I come from, yes we burn it
When we listen rob a dove
Where I come from, yes we burn it
After we dash to make love
Where I come from, yes we burn it
When the sun does shine
I blaze high-grade weed all the time


Now, my eyes are red
Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, my eyes are red
Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, my eyes are red
Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, my eyes are red
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, my eyes are red
Eyes are red
Ooohh
Eyes are red
Eyes are red
Eyes are red
Eyes are red
Eyes are red
Eyes are red
Eyes are red
Eyes are red

Woah
Woah
Woah
Woah
Woah
Yeah


Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right
I won't stop till my name's in lights
At stadium heights, with Damien Rice
On red carpets, Now I'm on Arabian nights
Because I'm young I know my brother's gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height, and I'm going hyper
Never be anything but a singer/songwriter
Yeah, the game's over, but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track, without a loop pedal
People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows, but
I haven't got a house, plus I live on the couch
So, you believe the lyrics when I'm singing them out, wow
From day one I've been prepared
With VO5 wax for my ginger hair
So now I'm back to the sofa
Giving a dose of what the future holds-
Cos it's another day close, close, close, close brrrrr
I've still got a rucksack for the old clothes
I rap with the cold flows
I'm back with the most jokes
In fact, you don't know
On tracks, I throw blows to make my punchlines relevant
If you can't keep up you'll get none, you're celibate
Man, flows developing
Skin lacks the melanin
Give me a shot of adrenaline and I get it in
I do it for the hell of it
Cause ever since I hit the mainstream with the A team
I seem to sell a bit
I took what held me back with the women
And then I packaged the image
Put in some content
And then I throw it back as a gimmick
The fact is this
I'll end up dating actresses
Wake up on dirty mattresses
I think I need to practice this
But I make shit happen, call me a laxative
World's on my shoulders
I don't even know what Atlas is
Hard part's sharp like a cactus is
I'm back to rapping back to back
Cause I've been practising
I'm back to sing this, yes


You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you

You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man


I'll keep my last name forever
Keep this genre pretty basic
Gonna be breaking into other people's tune
When I chase it
And replace it with an elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rapper's shoes, using new laces
I'm selling CD's from my rucksack
Aiming for the papers
Selling CD's from my rucksack
Aiming for the majors
Nationwide tour with Just Jack
Still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the moustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago
But, more people hear me, though
According to the Myspace and Youtube videos
I'm always doing shows, If I'm not I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up, call me Ruffio
Melody music maker
Reading all the papers
They say I'm up and coming
Like I'm fucking in an elevator


You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you

You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need youEmbed
1 ContributorBrother’s Blood LyricsFull lyrics will be available upon release, stay tuned!

*Snippet*
Oh my brother, why you've been
It's been the longest time apart
And I remember the days we were running free
Long before you broke my heart

Oh my brother, why you've been
It's been the longest time apart
And I remember the days we were running free
Long before you broke my heartEmbed
10 Lego House (Gosling Remix) Lyrics(P Money)

I feel like I had plastic surgery, cause today I looked in the mirror an' realised I'm faced with neglection
Feeling like I'm in the belly of the beast, trying to get out, I don't even think it knows that it's pregnant
Stuck in the dream of deception, similar to a scene from Inception
Looking at reviews from the last show baffled, thinking "how come I didn't even get a mention?"
Shocking. I think somebody put too many plugs in my extension
I signed to music for twenty-three years, now I'm wondering why it doesn't want an extension
I'm being ignored, even the crowds just staring, I see the tension
Now I'm on the stage feeling like a mobile phone in the basement, cause I got no reception
Ah, no bars, get it?
Now I'm choking, no bars, get it?
It turned cloudy, no stars, get it?
I hit the ground so hard, headache
Ah, it's mad
I should be proud right now but I'm sad
Cause me and the world are out of touch, like the relationship between me and my dad

(Ed Sheeran)

I'm out of touch, in a cold December
Now
Keep Me Warm
I'm out of sight
With all these things I've done
Don't hold me down
It's more than I can take
Now
I'm out of sight
In a cold December
(P Money)

Uh, my mum walks past me. my brother Prays asking why I have left them?
I didn't know I broke up with my girlfriend 'til I saw her with someone else in Beckton
(Wow)
I text her, "you dissed it". She don't reply like it's none of my business
My mind goes round in circles, it keeps on rolling, rolling more than Limp Bizkit
Why'd you do me so wicked? Something must've happened, how did I miss this?
Love turns to pain, expressed with rage. I want justice but I got no witness (help)
Now I'm powerless. Probably why I'm fascinated with Misfits
I guess I'm single, not happy, cause my heart doesn't feel like triplets
Ah, FREE, nobody understands but me
I don't think I got no-one but myself, so when I'm broke I still say "I got P"
Ah, it's mad. I should be proud right now but I'm sad
Cause me and the world are out of touch, like the relationship between me and my dad

(Ed Sheeran)

I'm out of touch, in a cold December
Now
Keep Me Warm
I'm out of sight
All these things I've done
Don't hold me down
It's more than I can take
Now
I'm out of sight
In a cold December
(P Money)

So many thoughts battle me, got me holding my head in agony
Trying to put the pieces together and figure out if this nightmare is really reality
So many turning their back on me
(wait)
It's slowly coming back to me
All I can see is the word tragedy, but I didn't think there was a fatality
Uh, damn, I think I know why I don't see my dad
I think I know why my mum walks past
And why me and my girlfriend don't chat
See, all this time I thought I was mad
I know why I'm not proud and why I'm sad
I'm out of sight and touch, cause back in March I don't think I survived that crash

(Ed Sheeran)

I'm out of touch, in a cold December
Now
Keep me warm
I'm out of sight
With all these things I've done
Don't hold me down
It's more than I can take
Now
I'm out of sight
In a cold December
Cold December (repeat till fade)2Embed
21 Family Lyrics
Hmm, let me go
To see my family
Please, Father, let me go
As my mother sleeps


I don't know about James bond
But round here nobody lives twice
When you're gone, you're gone, without no bye
Cause only a judge can give you life
This is my advice
Trust me, I nearly lost my life
3 weeks after I got this ride
Pissed like I had way too much wine
Wished I didn't get one
Anyway, I was going to The Macbeth booked for a set
Even though I didn't have a set one
Skream hit the decks, I was like check one
Put on a show, but it weren't my best one
Left it, dropped off Blacks at his destination
Then I was off to the next one
20 minutes later I was on the M1
Tired, but I kept on going
Fell asleep without even knowing
No motion in my face
No movement in my legs, but the car still kept going
Woke up, lorry, flash
Panic, break, skid, crash
Skidded more, bang, smash
Out cold, ribs cracked, ouch
I was in so much pain
Crawled out of a Mégane that now looked like a Mini
When I was still on the first lane
Baffled, didn't even know my name
Fainted, too much shock in my brain
Surrounded by paramedics and feds
Trying to get up but fainted again

See, I just want you to take a sec and hear me out
Don't think I'm happy cos I smile when you see me out
I've had serious madnesses where I've nearly disappeared
And I'm begging Lord to save me and let me go


To see my family
And keep it inside
Dry eyes, while my brother weeps
Save my soul
Please, Father, let me go
Keep me safe, as my mother sleeps


Eyes closed, they just wouldn't open
I could hear voices and my phone ringing
Fighting for life, can't tell if I'm winning
One of the worst situations I've been in
I could hear all of the angels singing
But when they stopped humming
My brain turned on, started running
Still in pain, but it started numbing
The stone cold comeback I made was stunning
I still tried to do a few shows 'cos I didn't wanna tell them that I weren't coming
But I was left with a permanent problem
Nobody knows about the pain that I'm in (sly)
Ever so cunning
6 weeks later, jogging and running
I used the first aid kit like a drum set
Picked up the tools and I gave it a drumming
Trust me, when it comes to mistakes
You can't afford to let one in
Never done tunes for a while
The pipeline was blocked
So I learned and done a bit of plumbing
They say tomorrow never dies
But they forgot to tell you, you can
You can have a sicker clan than Wu-Tang
But when your time's up, that's it, it's you fam
You can try beg for another
Sometimes I'll be on my way to a show
Thinking "I just wanna see my brother"
Then do a U-turn, I'm gone, one up



To see my family
And keep it inside
Dry eyes, while my brother weeps
Save my soul5Embed
12 Wildflowers Lyrics
Ivy vines that clothe the tree, daisies look and take a peak
Sun takes colours from the green and bleaches
December white, a cotton dress, open lawn to make a nest
Try to think what I love best in your features


You were born to run and run till you find your fire
I saw what you'd become, I know, I know
Blossoming among the wildflowers, flowers


Daggers wide, they cut through skin, a new addition to your grin
To reach the end, we must begin to feel it
Lie and trace you on the grass, hair that makеs a question mark
You'll always be in my heart, I mеan it


You were born to run and run till you find your fire
I saw what you'd become, I know, I know
Blossoming among the wildflowers, flowers




You were born to run and run till you find your fire
I saw what you'd become, I know, I know
Blossoming among the wildflowers, flowersEmbed
10 Stoned Lyrics
I wasn't lookin' for a hideaway
I need the heat of a thousand bodies
Crowds will devour, I don't need breathing space
Consumed by hopelessness and all my worries


Save me, colours erase, nothin' will fill up the space
I'm drownin' under the waves and so out of place
I'm feelin' away, maybe this life was a waste
Should I just throw it away?


All my friends have settled and grown
And then there's me, here, dancin' alone
Fueled by heartbreak mixed with the chemicals
They are sleeping and I am stoned
All my friends have settled and grown
And then there's me, here, dancin' alone
Am I breathing into my detriment?
I'll keep bleedin' and I'll be stoned


I don't want to have to cry again
Well, say to them "Goodbye" and "I'm so sorry"
This pain crescendo's riding till the end
Keep telling myself that it's them and not me

Save me, colours erase, nothin' will fill up the space
Drownin' under the waves and so out of place
I'm feelin' away, maybe this life was a waste
Should I just throw it away?


All my friends have settled and grown
And then there's me, here, dancin' alone
Fueled by heartbreak mixed with the chemicals
They are sleeping and I am stoned
All my friends have settled and grown
And then there's me, here, dancin' alone
Am I breathing into my detriment?
I'll keep bleedin' and I'll be stoned




All my friends have settled and grown
And then there's me, here, dancin' alone
Fueled by heartbreak mixed with the chemicals
They are sleeping and I am stoned
All my friends have settled and grown
And then there's me, here, dancin' alone
Am I breathing into my detriment?
I'll keep bleedin' and I'll be stonedEmbed
10 TranslationsEnglish2step (Finnish Remix) Lyrics
I had a bad week
Spent the evening pretending it wasn't that deep
You could see in my eyes that it was taking over
I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment
You know you take all of my stress right down
Help me get it off my chest and out
Into the ether with the rest of this mess that just keeps us depressed
We forget that we're here right now


'Cause we're livin' life at a different pace, stuck in a constant race
Keep the prеssure on, you're bound to break, somеthing's got to change
We should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn
If we're missin' out on what the people think is right
Seein' through a picture behind the screen and forget to be
Lose the conversation for the message that you'll never read
I think maybe you and me
Oh, we should head out to the place where the music plays
And then


We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone, then loved
And all we need is us to go all

Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us


Mä pakenin mun ongelmii
Viikonloppuihi ja sumusii tunnelmii
Ylianalyyttine ja ahdistukseen taipuvaine
Jonku mielestä vaa onnekas paskiaine
Mut ne ei tiiä kaikkee, yeah
Muista et menestys ja menetys kulkee käsikädes
Kohtalohan ei koskaa erehdy
Ja ihan sama mitä teet
Aina joku dumaa
Sä voit rakastaa tai vihaa mua
Mä teen silti musaa


Todellisuus hämärtyy
Taas yks uneton yö, mut mulla on syy
Muuki ku tää kakskytneljä-seiska työ
Se oot sinä, sun kanssa pysyy kirkkaana mun pää
Kenenkään muun kaa en haluu elää tätä elämää

We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone and loved
And all we need is us to go all


Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us to go all night
Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us to go all nightEmbed
9 Wake Me Up (Live at the Bedford) Lyrics
On the last few days of LA, I got taken into this guy's house and he was sponsored by an alcohol company---quite a few actually---and uh-- got pretty wasted, umm-- all times and I was sitting underneath a tree with my phone just putting in lyrics, "Bah! This is how I feel. Bah!" And uh... I came up with this song and it is called "Wake Me Up"
Because I was really pissed, it is quite silly. Bear that in mind


I should ink my skin with your name
And take my passport out again
And just replace it
See I could do without a tan
On my left hand
Where my fourth finger meets my knuckle
And I should run you a hot bath
Fill it up with bubbles

Cause maybe you're loveable
Maybe you're my snowflake
And your eyes turn from green to gray
And in the winter I'll hold you in a cold place
And you should never cut your hair
Cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder


And you will never know
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up

And would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me
Could you make me a cup of tea
To open my eyes in the right way
And I know you love Shrek
Because we've watched it 12 times
And maybe we're hoping for a fairytale too
And if your DVD breaks today
You should've got a VCR
Because I've never owned a blue ray, true say

I know I've always been shit at computer games
Because your brother always beats me
And if I lost, I go across and chuck all the controllers at the TV
And then you laugh at me
And be asking me
If I'm gonna be home next week
And then you lie with me till I fall asleep
And flutter eyelash on my cheek between the sheets


And you will never know
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up

And I think you hate the smell of smoke
You always try to get me to stop
But you drink as much as me
And I get drunk a lot
So I take you to the beach
And walk along the sand
And I'll make you a heart pendant
With a pebble held in my hand
And I'll carve it like this necklace
So the heart falls where your chest is
Now a piece of me is a piece of the beach
And it falls just where it needs to be
And rests peacefully
So you just need to breathe to feel my heart against yours now
Against yours now
Maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
Maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up


Girl me wann fi hold yuh
Put me arms right around ya
Girl you give me the tightest love me eva get inna my life
Girl me just wann fi  squeeze yah
Put me arms right around ya
Girl you give me the tightest love me eva get inna my life
Oh in my life, oh
Oh in my life, oh
Oh in my life, ooh oh

Maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
Maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up

Shock, horror, I’m down, lost, you’re not around
There’s a lump in my chest that sends cold through my head, and
My mind shuts sound out
I’m on auto-pilot, and my tongue's gone silent
Just switch it off and lay it down
Lay it down, next to you and me


I don’t know when I lost my mind
Maybe when I made you mine, woah
I don’t know when I lost my mind
Maybe it was every time that you say, you say, you say
That I miss you and I miss you


These words mean nothing to me
I’m just sitting on a fence of how it used to be
These three words are aching, constrict and suffocating
My mind is racing with the picture I’m painting
And my belly’s sick to its stomach
When I remember all the times he was with you when you laid it down
When you lay down next to me


I don’t know when I lost my mind
Maybe when I made you mine, woah
I don’t know when I lost my mind
Maybe it was every time that you say, you say, you say
That I miss you, more than I let on
I kissed you far too long
I’ll let go as soon as you do
See I know we’re not through

I don’t know when I lost my mind
Maybe when I made you mine, woah
I don’t know when I lost my mind
Maybe it was every time that you say, you say, you say
That I miss you and I miss you


I don’t know when I lost my mind
Maybe it was every time that you say, you say, you say
That I miss you3Embed
14 Where We Land Lyrics
Treat me beneath this clear night sky
And I will lie with you
I start to feel those butterflies
When I’m next to you


Tell me your secrets
Give me a friend
Let all the good times flood in
Do I love you? Do I hate you?
I can’t make up my mind
So let’s free fall and see where we land


It’s been this way since we were young
We’ll fight and then make up
I’ll breathe your air into my lungs
When I feel your touch


Tell me your secrets
Give me a friend
Let all the good times flood in
Do I love you? Do I hate you?
I can’t make up my mind
So let’s free fall and see where we land

Da da da da, da da da da
Da da da da
Da da da da, da da da da
Da da da da


Tell me your secrets
Give me a friend
Let all the good times flood in
Do I love you? Do I hate you?
I can’t make up my mind
So let’s free fall and see where we land3Embed
18 Goodbye to You Lyrics
Hey, can you hear me
I just wanted to let you know, hmm


I hope you can hear what I write to you
How could I say goodbye to you?
When I'm a life that came out of the inside of a life that was inside of you
I gotta respect the way you provided food, for the whole fam
You came over a moon rush supporting a mar jays old man
Cold double 8, 8 kids bare wheels
Plus racists full of hatred in your own plant
3 jobs in a day
Rest in life in you working but you were never stress free
Just locked in a cage slaving
They said they were gold in the pavements
But you came and saw the road to amazement
Broke your heart
But still you were prone to last and your sorrow was over fast
I hope your listening right
I still think of you every Sunday
No one can top your chicken and rice
Even through the darkness times
You held us all up because your vision was bright
I knew your strength was your wisdom inside
You never let anyone see your heartache
You just got on with it
Anyone tells me that they knew you said you were beautiful
And your words you would stand strong with it
Cause they were like warmth on a winter night
But I was just too young to go on with it
And there somethings I could try to do
But it's an impossible task for me to even try to say goodbye to you
I couldn't do that, I owe my life to you

And of the pieces of my soul
(Because I need a sign, I hope this pain will heal in time)
You know I never want to be alo-oh-oh-one
I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there?
Can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
Or feel the chill of your warm embrace?
Can I say goodbye to you? Ohh


I think you phoney
I was younger with the knowledge of things that I know now
I would be by your side when you needed me
Instead of asking you "Nan can I go out?"
Standing in a road with the gangs that I know now
Everyone's missing you loads, Jessica's grown up
Warreen, Lauren and Alex are fine and I'm living with hope
It's been a while since I've seen C and the mouths
I miss seeing a family, being a family
And us agreeing with smiles how it used to be as a child
But as time goes by, the bridge seems longer
Family problems have never been funny
In my heart the only one that dissed me was Sonia
She took all our inheritance money
Left the rest of us to pick up the pieces
I never forgive the way she betrayed us
There ain't a big enough reason
Before I sell out my fam I'll be giving up breathing
But I guess that everyone's different
Or should I say no one's perfect?
She had happiness in front of her
But chose to ride the wave that no ones surfing
Since you gone the foundations crumbled
So building it back up is my next step
I got all the bricks and the cement but
It's hard when it's done, I don't know what to expect
So give me the strength that I need to perform this task
Make it right, I must do
And I ask cause I trust you
It goes way beyond a song when I say I love you

And of the pieces of my soul
(Because I need a sign, I hope this pain will heal in time)
You know I never want to be alo-oh-oh-one
I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there?
Can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
Or feel the chill of your warm embrace?
Can I say goodbye to you? Ohh


It's just for now so I should hush
I'll never get enough, I'll see you when I see you but
I miss you, oh how I miss you
It's just for now so I should hush
I'll never get enough, I'll see you when I see you but
I miss you, oh how I miss you


There ain't enough words to describe
How sorry I am for the pain that I caused
Sorry for when I stuck up my own blood
We were young and he said it was raping his broad
And for the day police came to the door
I'm sorry for being such a bad youth
Stealing from your purse and making you mourn
I never been able to say this before
Cause I was so inconsiderate
You loved me unconditionally
And I took advantage of it like a idiot
Not seeing the pure soul that I was living with
I really hope that you can forgive me
You going away was a punishment
But I won't let go I'm holding you with me
But I still fight the emotions within me

I can see the stars as the cold wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there?
And can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down your face
Feel the chill of your warm embrace?
And can I say goodbye to you?
I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there?
Can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
Or feel the chill of your warm embrace?
Can I say goodbye to you?6Embed
8 Candle In The Wind LyricsGoodbye Norma Jean
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
Oh the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend never did

Goodbye Norma Jean
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
Goodbye Norma Jean
From the young man in the 22nd row
Who sees you as something as more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend never did
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend never didEmbed
13 TranslationsDeutschWelcome To The World Lyrics
Welcome to the world
I heard your heart beat and lost every word
Just stood there quietly taking in the sound
Of our love
This is gonna hurt
But I'll stand beside you, for better or for worse
And I will find you whenever you're lost
I'll be right here


And ooh, I know that everything's changin'
Ooh, and I don't wanna miss a thing
Ooh, I know that life won't ever be the same
And this love won't ever go away


Welcome to the world
Through all the pain, you're a diamond in the dirt
Don't let them change you, words are only words
Just like I loved you
And yes, you were the first
Brought a new beginning, bright and unreserved
A beautiful red flower in the earth
Will grow, and I know

Ooh, I know that everything's changin'
Ooh, and I don't wanna miss a thing

8 Sing (French Remix) Lyrics
It's late in the evening
Glass on the side
I've been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignorin' everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
And I don't wanna know
If you're gettin' ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no-man's land
And for the longest time, lady


I need you darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin'
Won’t you let me know
If you love me
Come on, get involved
Feel it rushin' through you
From your head to toe


SING!
LOUDER!
SING!

J'étais à l'affût dès que je l'ai vu dans le fumoir
Elle m'a dit : « Tu me plais, j'ai peur de te blesser, fuis moi »
C'était comme un frisson qui m'sortait d'un puits sombre
Une impulsion puissante de mon intuition
Ton cœur est brisé, laisse-moi réparer tout ça
La souffrance à tes côtés me paraît douce
Elle m'a dit : “ C'est de la parlotte, chéri ”
Oui, mais on est séduits l'un par l'autre, chérie
Allez, montre-moi...
Je ne vais pas m'étendre, non
Allons se détendre, elle m'a
Demandé que je l'étrangle tendrement
Alors on cède aux vices sans trop discuter
Elle le sait d'office grosses cuisses pour m'exciter
J'ai mis en scène les prémisses de cette promiscuité
On s'est rien promis, on s'aime pour mieux s'quitter






Can you feel it?
All the guys in here don't even wanna dance
Can you feel it?
All that I can hear is music from the back
But can you feel it?
Found you hidin' here so won't you take my hand, darlin'?
Before the beat kicks in again
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

3 Masters of War (Cover) Lyrics
Come ye masters of war
You that build the big guns
You that build the death planes
You that build all the bombs
You that hide behind walls
You that hide behind desks
I just want you to know
I can see through your masks


You that never done nothin'
But build to destroy
You play with my world
Like it’s your little toy
Put a gun in my hands
And you hide from my eyes
And you turn and run farther
As the fast bullets fly


Like Judas of old
You lie and deceive
A war can be won
You want me to believe
But I see through your eyes
And I see through your brain
Like I see through the water
That runs down my drain

You fasten all the triggers
For the others to fire
Then you sit back and watch
As the death count gets high
And you hide in your mansion
While the young people’s blood
Flows out of their bodies
And is buried in the mud


And you’ve thrown the worst fear
That can ever be hurled
Fear to bring children
Into the world
For threatening my baby
Unborn and unnamed
Well, you ain't worth the blood
That runs in your veins


How much do I know
To talk out of turn
You might say that I’m young
You might say I’m unlearned
But there’s one thing I know
Though I’m younger than you
Even Jesus would never
Forgive what you do

Let me ask you one question
Is your money that good?
Will it buy you forgiveness
Do you think that it could?
Well, I think you will find
When your death takes its toll
All the money you made
Will never buy back your soul


And I hope that you die
And your death'll come soon
And I'll follow your casket
In the pale afternoon
And I’ll watch as you’re lowered
Down to your deathbed
And I’ll stand over your grave
To make sure that you’re dead


Cool
He's an intense guy, isn't he?Embed
12 Fire Alarms Lyrics
The rain won't stop falling
It's harder than before
This car keeps on stalling
Pedal to the floor


And what I need to know
Is if you love me and I
Really need to know
Is if you want me when you
Call
If you want me when you
Call


We were young and we were foolish
School books in our arms
Dodging homework, dodging classes
To set off fire alarms


And what I need to know
Is if you love me and I
Really need to know
If you need me when you
Call
If you want me when you
Call
We are waving
Our lives away
We are waving
Our lives away
We are waving
Our lives away
We are waving
Our lives away
We are waving
We are waving

We are waving
We are waving
We are waving
We are waving

And what I need to know
Is if you love me and I
Really need to know
If you need me when you call
And what I need to know
Is if you love me and I
Really need to know
If you need me when you call
What I need to know

21 Radio Lyrics
Hi, my name is JME
There was a time when radio played me
'Cause my music came from my heart
It was real to me, but now it's a par
I'm here struggling, keeping it real
While the rest of them are hustling, seeking a deal
Sometimes I sit back and think
"JME just do one tune, make a couple Gs and chill"
The reason I started making music is the exact same
Reason that I'll never do it, I swear
I didn't go through all of that for this
I'll give that a miss, that's just how it is
I'm fair, straight, who can tell me different?
Look at me, determined, man on a mission
My music is me, and I am my music
So like it or lump it, I'ma do this


I never had a playlist in my heart (Oh, woah, oh)
Now I need an A list just to chart (Oh, woah, oh)
But I've been famous from the start (Oh, woah, oh)
How am I gonna make my mark? Oh, oh


Are you gonna play me though?
This song was never meant for the radio
I get it in forget a radio spin, I'm just doing my thing
And I don't have time for a playlist
And how much will you pay me though
If this song was not a hit on the radio?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Thank God for night clubs and the raves
'Cause I don't think they like us on the airwaves
Unless we water it down
But cordial music is boring me now
I swear, I guess it matters what your goal is
Or in this music scene, what your role is
I'm still trying here, 'cause I'm a pioneer
I use my mouth less than I use my eyes and ears
See, I'm just telling you the truth
Can't shoot the messenger, bulletproof booth
You won't hear me on the radio
But go to the rave, and the crowd, they're raising roof
Why is that? What's going on there?
To tell you the truth, I don't really care
I am my music, my music is me
Like it or not, this is how it's gonna be


I never had a playlist in my heart (Oh, woah, oh)
Now I need an A list just to chart (Oh, woah, oh)
But I've been famous from the start (Oh, woah, oh)
How am I gonna make my mark? Oh, oh


Are you gonna play me though?
This song was never meant for the radio
I get it in forget a radio spin, I'm just doing my thing
And I don't have time for a playlist
And how much will you pay me though
If this song was not a hit on the radio?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I feel it on the airwave, spinning on the dial
Bleeding through the speakers, written by the pile
So won't you hear me out?
Never feel it from the bass line, feel it in the club
Maybe I could take time singing for the dub
So won't you hear me out?


Are you gonna play me though?
This song was never meant for the radio
I get it in forget a radio spin, I'm just doing my thing
And I don't have time for a playlist
And how much will you pay me though
If this song was not a hit on the radio?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Are you gonna play me though?
This song was never meant for the radio
I get it in forget a radio spin, I'm just doing my thing
And I don't have time for a playlist
And how much will you pay me though
If this song was not a hit on the radio?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh2Embed
5 Galway Girl (Martin Jensen Remix) Lyrics
I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance


You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
"I just want to dance"
"I just want to dance"
"I just want to dance"
"I just want to dance"
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl
Galway Girl, you're my pretty little Galway Girl


You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
Acapella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me

You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
"I just want to dance"
"I just want to dance"
"I just want to dance"
"I just want to dance"
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl
Galway Girl, you're my pretty little Galway Girl


And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night


She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
"I just want to dance"
"I just want to dance"
"I just want to dance"
"I just want to dance"
With my pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl

6 Perfect (Mike Perry Remix) Lyrics
I found a love for me
Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine


Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight
Darling, you look perfect tonight


Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect tonight


Darling, you look perfect tonightEmbed
3 Hallelujah LyricsI heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Maybe there's a god above
But all I ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
It's not a cry you can hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

You said I took the name in vain
Well, I never really knew that name
But if I did, what really is it to you?
I've seen your flag on the marble arch
Love is not some victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew her
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah

6 You Need Me, I Don’t Need You (True Tiger Remix) Lyrics
Right now it's the millitant spot with Fizzer and Dot
We've got a villainous plot to make billions watch
Bringing the hot flows skipping across
Delivering some of the illest bars, killing them off
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, yeah we're doing the damn thing
Man think we need them but onna that thing
Nah I'm back in this raptures, double my ad-libs
Got them all banging the anthems having a madness
For me the music's the thorn in my vein
Calling my name, yeah, we're lord of the raves
I swear down I got them all talking my name
Been working all year it's the ultimate gain
Uh, look I don't need you making us angry, we were so peaceful
You don't really wanna see us get so lethal, any foe to approach
Will be ghosted and don't be fooled, yes, people


'Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you

You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me

Yeah, yeah y'all messed up everybody's hyped
Even a blind man can see the devil in my eyes
Many were the times that he saw me stepping on the mic
Setting it alight, come up with the energy and vibe
Feel like I'm back from a coma, stronger than ever
Songs are forever so I'm living longer than ever
Any genre, whatever, I'll be setting off a bomb
Cause my longevity's just too long for a measure
Well I'm setting off better, I'm taking over faster
Showering down, you better put your umbrella on
Yeah I'm stepping up a level, got my foot on the pedal
I'm coming to be the better vision than  when I'm spitting
They had to resist because they need a stage to perform
Case and a cord, you won't see me pace through the door
Thinking I'm gonna be rich so I'm chasing the Forbes
Spreading like a plague, songs getting played when I 


'Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don’t need you

You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me

Yo, living out our days in 
As if I went crazy in a whip crashing the ride
Double "P" when we enter that's passion and pride
They ain't gotta life cause they let that battery die
I'm a shooting star that ain't catching your eye
An assassin with lines and immaculate rhymes
They all say they're the truth but it's actually lies
So we hit them with a punch like a Cassidy line
Yeah I tried to relax but you can feel the anger inside
Raging like I stand on the right, yeah my stamina is high
Yeah I'm living like I stand with the Mayans
So think twice cause our plans are defiant
It's blatant you need me, who's this face on the TV?
Come on, we're taking it easy
Got kids in the school exchanging the CD
Love hearing the bars, impatient to cheer me

'Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you

You need me, man, I don’t need you at all

7 Drunk in Love/1 + 1 (Acoustic Cover) Lyrics
I've been drinking, I've been drinking
I get filthy when that liquor get into me
I've been thinking, I've been thinking
Why can't I keep my fingers off it, baby? I want you, na-na
Why can't I keep my fingers off it, baby? I want you, na-na
Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feeling like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashing lights, flashing lights
You got me faded, faded-faded, baby, I want you, na-na
You got me faded, faded-faded, baby, I want you, na-na
Drunk in love, I want you

We woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh baby, drunk in love
We be all night, last thing I remember is our
Beautiful bodies grinding up in that club, drunk in love

And we be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

We be all night, and everything all right
No complaints from my body, so fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinking, park it in my lot, 7-11
I'm rubbing on it, you rubbing on it, if you scared, call that reverend
Boy, I'm drinking, get my brain right, gangster wife
Louis rags, he sweat it out, he sweat it out, I'm with that
Boy, I'm drinking, now I'm on the mic to my boy's toys
Then I fill the tub up halfway then ride it with my surfboard
Surfboard, surfboard
Graining on that wood, graining, graining on that wood
I'm swerving on that, swerving, swerving on that
Big body just graining on that wood-wood-wood-wood-woooood


We woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh baby, drunk in love
We be all night, last thing I remember is our
Beautiful bodies grinding up in that club, drunk in love

Now we be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

I don't know much about love but I - know I've been shot by you
I don't know much about Algebra but I know 1+1 is two
Cause we ain't got nothing without love
And baby you got enough for the both of us

Cause we be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love5Embed
1 ContributorWish You Were Here LyricsSo, so you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell
Blue skys from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?
And did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?
How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls
Swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
Running over the same old ground
What have we found?
The same old fears
Wish you were hereEmbed

The more that I know you, the more I want to
Something inside me’s changed
I was so much younger yesterday

Emotional earthquake, bring on disaster

Something inside me’s changed
I was so much younger yesterday

7 Addicted Lyrics
I think I took too much
I'm addicted to your touch
But I'm crying
In shame again


And now I'm high as a kite
And I know I might be gone
When you get home


Oh well, we've come this far
You're my Venus
And I'm your Mars
And we've passed the moon and stars
And I'm gone


But now I'm high as a kite
And I know I might be gone
When you get home
I'm high as a kite
And I know I'm almost gone
When you get home

So please come homeEmbed
6 I Love You Lyrics
I'm standing on a mountain
Waiting for you to come
You were sitting counting
The days that I had gone
The note I wrote
I wrapped up in a cigarette
Burned away the memories
I tried to forget
But not yet


Wishing my life away
But these three words
I have to say to you
My baby blue
You know it's true
I love you
I love you


How can I tell you?
I don't know what to say
This chance that I won't miss
But I miss you anyway
I feel your pain
It's turning me insane
Thrown away
I had to take the last train home
But then you came

Wishing my life away
But these three words
I have to say to you
My baby blue
You know it's true
I love you
Wishing my life away
These three words
I have to say to you
My baby blue
You know it's true
You know it's true
I love you
I love you
I love you1Embed
12 Nightmares Lyrics
They tell me you can only dream when you fell asleep
But now I'm working to achieve, but sleep is the only thing I never see
And I vowed that my breathing will never cease
To the retrieve then I can't let them be
I won't let 'em leave and I had the same feeling since 17
But I wasn't ready then like when a lemon's green
Now I'm in the magazines almost every week
Cause I'm getting heat like in Tenerife
Right now it's better than it's ever been
Never fade like a plant that's evergreen
It's what I hoped in my heart, but my self doubts are getting me
Faith in my crafts getting dark by the day and I'm getting weak
Cause I'm new, I'm not where the stars be
They chase dreams together like a slumber party
And now I'm on my own, even though I'm smooth sailing
I'm scared to sing, cause my nightmares'll fade in


When the darkness creeps in
I feel my nightmares watching me
And when my dreams are sleeping
I feel my nightmares watching me
I feel my nightmares watching me
I feel my nightmares watching me
Watching me

You better wake up cause I A.M making moves
And even when I'm dozing I'm breaking rules
I'm only hitting the sack when I'm training
Too busy tryna keep up with the latest snooze
Made my bed and that's where I'm heading
I fly straight but the best man I embed 'em
Married to the game was a quiet wedding
And I had to fight to get her, I am tekken (taking)
Control of my inception
Cause they're try to hit my misses with my erection
See they better marry Donna cause when I strike, back
Not even Argentina's gonna cry for them
See I'm awake at night, with the ammunish
Cause the haters know where the family lives
Anyone I catch playing knock down ginger
Is gonna lose a lot more, than Annie did
They say sleep is the cousin of death
But I ain't hearing that shh... cousin, I'm—
Gang signs I'm in LA reading (LA Reid'n)
I'm a CEO, mother suckers I'm next (Sway)


When the darkness creeps in
I feel my nightmares watching me
And when my dreams are sleeping
I feel my nightmares watching me
I feel my nightmares watching me
I feel my nightmares watching me
Watching me

They're watching me, they watch me sleep
Let me go
I fell asleep on myself, woke up in reality
And daydream about losing my sanity
I've been rhyming forever, got a blind flow
So I can see an off note with my eyes closed
But to achieve your dreams you can't doze off cause you dream a sleep
I ain't nodding off but I'm nodding to the beat
I be shocking in my sheets, when I should have been asleep
See, all the dreams I'm fond of
You placed me in the team insomnia
Now, I'm Mr hard worker
In my nightmares I'm Mr can't turn up
And I missed my chance, worst luck
Trying to hit women like Mr Ike Turner
Yeah, but I walked from that ish
Now they gotta put me to rest, mattress


When the darkness creeps in
I feel my nightmares watching me
And when my dreams are sleeping
I feel my nightmares watching me
I feel my nightmares watching me
I feel my nightmares watching me
Watching me1Embed
12 You Lyrics
The thoughts I have could be clear ones, they can seem vivid
The goals I reach are not near ones, the further the limit
I block her out so when I'm looking though my mind she ain't in it
Can I be free for a minute? Can I be me for a minute?
The thoughts I have can be dark ones, even be smart ones
I know I'm gonna have a couple straight from the heart ones
Tell you what I think, I will until I depart mum
It's you that I live for, I'm the first and the last one to love you lots
What's better than thinking about the ones you love?
Nothing much when you're thinking about the ones you love
I feel the same when I'm on the floor, see the sun above
Unconditional like bills payed when I've run 'em up
No one here to help you pay now you're gonna moan
No one here to save the day now you're all alone
Wish I was born with a golden spoon in my mouth
Fact is, I wasn't so I'm coming from a quarter zone


And when the sun falls down I'll be up again, and never close my eyes
And if the dawn might break I'll see nothing when, nothing when
My thoughts are only you, and my mind is over you
My thoughts are over you, and these words are all for you now, for you


I wanna see you happy, I wanna see you smile
Cause you've been trespassing and you won't leave my mind
Now I've been thinking about this, you told me say "Yes Nan"
I'm 31 now, I'm still saying "Yes Nan"
You had to replace my mum, dad, two parents in one
I know you're proud staring at your grandson, I found a job I like
Got the flat, the cars to buy got the quad I like
And cause of you and Kylie it's in every single song I write
Had a golden life, wanted people to honour mine
Tell 'em while I'm here cause one day I'm gonna die
And when I'm gone I want my music to play
And when my people listen to this track it's gonna make 'em wanna cry
I ain't gonna lie, I think about the scene I made
I say the game's better, it's a must now I've gotta fly
My talents gonna shine real shortly, fam i know it
I work round the clock I don't stop at night

4 We Are Lyrics
Oh oh, Oh oh
Oh oh, Oh oh
Oh oh, Oh oh
Oh oh


Leaves have fallen to the ground
And now there's no one else around
To hear the cry
Oh oh
I saw your body
I saw your face
Loss of presence
Loss of grace
Behind those eyes
Oh oh


And we break down
We lose touch
Sometimes
We are
Alone


Oh oh, Oh oh
Oh oh, Oh oh
Oh oh

I miss your laughter
I miss your tears
I miss your rambling
About your fears
Your smile
The crowd has gathered
All around
No one's speaking
No one makes a sound
And I...


And we break down
We lose touch
Sometimes
We are
Alone
We break down
We lose touch
Sometimes
Alone
Alone now...


They're never gonna change you
They're never gonna change me
They're never gonna change us
We'll always stay the same


We break down
We lose touch
Sometimes
We are
We break down
We lose touch
Sometimes
We are
We break down
We lose touch
Sometimes
We are
AloneEmbed
8 2step (Italian Remix) Lyrics
I had a bad week
Spent the evening pretending it wasn't that deep
You could see in my eyes that it was taking over
I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment
You know you take all of my stress right down
Help me get it off my chest and out
Into the ether with the rest of this mess that just keeps us depressed
We forget that we're here right now


'Cause we're livin' life at a different pace, stuck in a constant race
Keep the prеssure on, you're bound to break, somеthing's gotta change
We should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn
If we're missin' out on what the people think is right
Seein' through a picture behind the screen and forget to be
Lose the conversation for the message that you'll never read
I think maybe you and me
Oh, we should head out to the place where the music plays
And then


We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone, then loved
And all we need is us to go all

Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us


Quando mi dai poco voglio troppo da te, però
Quando mi dai troppo non capisco cos'è
Vorrei sparire di botto
Come la pioggia d'agosto
Poi dimostrarti che torno
In fondo l'amore è il ritorno, però
Siediti che ti racconto
Come si può nella vita stare in piedi
Senza che nessuno paghi per te il conto
Ed esser oggi quel che tu sognavi ieri?
Come ho fatto a non vederlo nei miei occhi
Che ho già dentro quel che io cercavo fuori?
Dai, sarà che c'ho il destino in tasca
E lo decido io se un giorno questo cambia


We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone and loved
And all we need is us to go all night

Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us to go all night
Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us to go all nightEmbed
13 Drown Me Out Lyrics
I'm in so deep
Omar Epps could relate to my situation on a real
Pain ain't the emotion I want to feel, but I'm thriving off it
So it's only right I like this topic, I be on a hill
Keeping my head above water
I can't afford to ever get caught in a corner
So I move with the force of a sorcerer
It's dark when I'm about, just me, myself and my shadow
And I'm parro, running out of ammo
And it seems like everyone around me's on the same path so it's narrow
The less then the better
More proof for the last one left
So they want to leave me as wet as an umbrella
I play fool to catch wise, how they ever gonna guess I'm clever?
How can I be at my best with this pressure?
I've got a lot to lose
So when I watch the news, my minds infected with terror
No wonder I'm under stress
I got my door kicked down by a bunch of feds
And when they left, it looked like I'd had a rave
And invited more than a hundred guests
I shoulda bust the back door and jumped the fence
It's easier when you look back shoulda, woulda, coulda
But I bet you can't bring should, woulda could back
Back to 15, 
I said to myself that I'm more than a hoodrat

Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you will never drown me out
Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you will never drown me out, out, out
You won't drown me out, out, out
You won't drown me out


You can never drown me out, the water supply's too low
And I'm round about 6-1, 10 stone
I've never seen someone drown without
A sufficient amount of liquid in their lungs
And I'm an MC, my mouth can vouch
Do I sound like I'm choking?
Seriously, do I sound like I'm joking? I'm floating
Even though they want to send me to the bottom of the ocean
But I am a ship that sunk many years, blud, I'm maintaining
Plain sailing, no commotion
Like a dolphin when it's in motion
Nothing can't break me, so why would I show them I'm broken?
No real stress, no, my skin ain't close to corrosion
Fuck them all, this ain't tug of war, still they'll get roped in the open
I don't want to reveal my violent side, but I swear that I will soon
If the Lord above don't provide a sign, then I'mma kill you
Arm for arm, eye for eye
I just want to live my life
But they don't want to see this guy survive

5 Amsterdam (Sweet Mary Jane) Lyrics
I woke up early looking out my window
At the Amsterdam sky
Oh baby I was high last night
Café clouds and red lights
When I gotcha in mind
You slowed down time
Oh baby I was out of my mind
Sing a song cover and hold me tight


I drill you deep into my chest
That’s where it feels the best
You can remove all the scars
Stop them from breaking my heart
Been on a hurting spree
That brought out the worst in me
Cause I don't want to be alone


Cause everyday that I'm breathing I think you are the one
I love the way that your sweet words just roll off of my tongue
Feel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs
Sweet Mary Jane won’t you sing me another song


Café clouds and shooting stars are floating across the sky
Oh baby what a beautiful sight
But we're only satellites
Oh di ba di ba oh la lights
Oh baby I am so damn high
Have you seen my eyes

With the beat beat of my heart
You take me back to the start
Where everything began
Holding you inside my hands
Between my fingers and thumb
I seal you in with my tongue
Cause I don't want to be alone


Cause everyday that I'm breathing I think you are the one
I love the way that your sweet words just roll off of my tongue
Feel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs
Sweet Mary Jane won’t you sing me another song


Na na na na na Sweet Mary Jane
Na na na na na Sweet Mary Jane
Na na na na na Sweet Mary Jane
Na na na na na Sing another song


Mary Jane
I've been hoping alone
Mary Jane
Since you came along
Mary Jane
I'm almost home
Mary Jane
Sing another song

Cause everyday that I'm breathing I think you are the one
I love the way that your sweet words just roll off of my tongue
Feel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs
Sweet Mary Jane won't you sing me another song


Cause everyday that I’m breathing, sweet mary jane
I love the sound of your sweet words, sweet mary jane
Feel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs
Sweet Mary Jane won’t you sing me another song2Embed
4 I Will Take You Home Lyrics
I stole a car last night
Don't know where we're gonna go
But go ahead and drive
I will take you home
Honey, it's cold outside
And your jumper's torn
But darling, hold on tight
I will keep you warm


And we will cry
'Til this fire is drowned
And we will write
All our memories down
And we will drive 'til these tyres wear out
But darling I, I will take you home


If we could drive all night
Until the sun is shown
I'll see it in your eyes, yeah
They will take me home
Honey, it's so damn bright
Daylight's taking over again
Just follow the signs
They will lead us home



And we will drive 'til our tyres wear out
And we will write all our memories down
And we will cry 'til this fire is drowned
But darling I, I will keep you warm
Oh darling I, I will keep you warm
Darling I, I take you home4Embed

9 Photograph (Felix Jaehn Remix) Lyrics
Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It's the only thing that makes us feel alive


We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen, still


So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me, that's okay baby
Only words bleed inside these pages
You just hold me
And I won’t ever let you go
Wait for me to come home


Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of ya
And it's the only thing to take with us when we die

Oh you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul


Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home


When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
Wait for me to come homeEmbed
9 You Break Me Lyrics
Well my friend it seems we’ve come too far to disagree
My knees feel weak and I fell too fast
The tide is high but we swam in too deep
To catch your breath you tear me apart piece by piece
You can take away all this mess
And I could never think anything less of you


‘Cos you break me
You numb me
You still seem to stun me
This pain has outrun me
You are all I have left


The tide flows out as I leave empty rooms
To spur this on we left that room too long
You open wide and all the lies flow out
To eat you whole
But we both know that you’re too cold
And she said ‘I can put away all those lies
And show you there’s no surprise in me’


Well still, you break me
You numb me
You still seem to stun me
This pain has outrun me
You are all that I have left

Exorcise these demons
But they keep talking to me
I am no believer
But I believe you will relieve me
I believe you will relieve me
And that’s what’s going on




You break me4Embed
10 The City (Live at Sticky Studios) Lyrics
This city never sleeps
I hear the people walk by when it’s late
And sirens bleed through my windowsill
I can’t close my eyes
Don’t control what I’m into
And this tower is alive
The lights that blind keep me awake
My hood up and lace untied
Sleep fills my mind
Don’t control what I’m into


London calls me a stranger, a traveller
This is now my home, my home


I’m burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
And I’m blazing on the street
What I do isn’t up to you
And if the city never sleeps then that makes two


The pavement is my friend
It will take me where I need to go
So I find it trips me up
And puts me down
This is not what I’m used to
And the shop across the road
Fulills my needs and gives me company
When I need it
Voices speak through my walls
I don’t think I’m gonna make it
Past tomorrow

And London calls me a stranger, a traveller
This is now my home, my home


Burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
And I’m blazing on the street
What I do isn’t up to you
And if the city never sleeps then that makes two


And my lungs hurt
And my ears bled
With the sound of the city life
Echoed in my head
Do I need this
To keep me alive?
The traffic stops and starts, but I
Need to move along


I’m from a city where the rain won’t cease
Pollution in the air matches that on the street
The black smoke gets your head into a muddle, like
Walking into elephant syringes in the puddle, like
I was a country boy when I moved out
Grew up too fast for my family to find out
Now I try to stop my music running into nosedives
Can’t resort to arrogance with white lies
This city won’t erase me
But I can’t help to see how this dark city changed me
It’s all the same see, music is my life, but
Now I try to fight whatever I need to hide from
North, South, East, West, London’s my home now
Knees weak, but we never slow down
Now I start to do my music properly
And stay from all the negative shit that will follow me

And London calls me a stranger
This is not my home, home


Burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
And I’m blazing on the street
What I do isn’t up to you
And if the city never sleeps then that makes two
Burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
And I’m blazing on the street
What I do isn’t up to you
And if the city never sleeps then that makes two1Embed
7 Candle in the Wind (2018 Version) Lyrics
Goodbye Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name


And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did


Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
Oh the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did


Goodbye Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
Goodbye Norma Jeane
From the young man in the 22nd row
Who sees you as something more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe


And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever didEmbed
5 Move On Lyrics
Now it seems I’ve been young, dug my hole in the ground
To me there’s only up, there ain’t no point in looking down
However hard I try, I only get weaker
Seems my lies and worries got my mind in a sleeper hold


What you gotta do is never get yourself down
Bastards do that for you, get you deeper in the ground
Keep out of trouble, ain’t no trouble being pure
Seems like all you bastards gave me something to ignore now


Move on, forget it
Now move on, forget it


When I first started this rapping shit I felt pressure from haters
Became invaded with sadists and just developed a hater radar
And made for the stars, kept my grind in the dark
And then appeared with a remedy kicking rhymes with a melody
Hennesey shots and Glocks, all these fools on the block
Who said you gotta be a gangster now to raise to the top?
I'm just a normal, casual, usual, everyday type of guy
With my head in the sky
Ed Sheeran, Urban Angel coming ready to die
So see the signs, stand to the side
Open your eyes and take a look and realise
The resurrection's arrived
And as the mist clears, homie I arise
From my tomb in disguise
I'm all alone, Alonestar
Urban Angel rising from the ashes
Surprising all haters, guiding, advising them all to steady move
Now back up

Move on, forget it
Now move on, forget it


All I want in this cold world is to make music and use it
Not to abuse it and get affected, infected with the who's who of music
Who did it, who is it, who's in it, who…what the fuck does it matter?
Chitter chatter, don't matter, yidder, yidder, yadder
It don't matter to me
All I want is a bit of dignity in me to battle this industry freely
To be me in this seedy, needy world, can you hear me?
Yeah, yeah, can you hear me?


Keep out of trouble, ain’t no trouble being pure
Seems like all you bastards gave me something to ignore now


Move on, forget it
Now move on, forget itEmbed
5 2step (Spanish Remix) Lyrics
I had a bad week
Spent the evening pretending it wasn't that deep
You could see in my eyes that it was taking over
I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment
You know you take all of my stress right down
Help me get it off my chest and out
Into the ether with the rest of this mess that just keeps us depressed
We forget that we're here right now


'Cause we're livin' life at a different pace, stuck in a constant race
Keep the prеssure on, you're bound to break, somеthing's gotta change
We should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn
If we're missin' out on what the people think is right
Seein' through a picture behind the screen and forget to be
Lose the conversation for the message that you'll never read
I think maybe you and me
Oh, we should head out to the place where the music plays
And then


We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone, then loved
And all we need is us to go all

Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us


Otra noche que no duermo imaginando que tu vida sin mí sería más fácil
Otros concierto', otras ciudade', otra dosi'
Otro intento que va a quedar en un "casi"
Dejando el móvil encendido por si
Llama' para preguntar qué tal me van todo' mis male'
Dime si piensas en mí cuando por la' noche' sale'
Que yo cancelo lanzamiento' y festivale'
Por ti-i-i-i, i-i-i-i-i-i
Vuelvo a la isla que nos vio crecer
A recordarme que por ti fue por que empecé


We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone, then loved
And all we need is us to go all

Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us to go all night
Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us to go all nightEmbed
3 Wonderwall LyricsToday is gonna be the day that they're gonna give it back to you
By now you should've somehow realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

Backbeat the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out
And I'm sure you've heard it all before but you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead the way are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how...

I said maybe...
You're gonna be the one that saves me...
And after all...
You're my wonderwall...

Today was gonna be the day but they'll never bring it back to you
By now you should've somehow realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead the way are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how...
I said maybe...
You're gonna be the one that saves me...
You're could have be the one that saves me...
And after all...
You're my wonderwall...
You're my wonderwall...
You're my wonderwall...
You're my wonderwall...Embed
5 Open Your Ears Lyrics
Can’t get you off my mind
Look at me and you will find
Time after time it seems
I’ll say what I don’t mean
In your world we were the same
In mine now you’re the one to blame
You can’t remember my name
We’re lost, it’s such a shame


Listen to me
Stop making me see
What I’ve been waiting for
Listen to me
Stop making me see


I’m strong yet proud
I’m quiet yet loud
And I’m everything
You want in me
I’m small yet tall
I have it all
And I’m everything
You want me to be

Listen to me
Stop making me see
What I’ve been waiting for
Listen to me
Stop making me see


And I still feel like
I need you still
And I still feel like
I’m on some pill
And I still feel like
I need you still


Listen to me
Stop making me see
What I’ve been waiting for
Listen to me
Making me seeEmbed

3 Tattoo (Demo) Lyrics
Mmm, yeah you burned me again
Well, I don't wanna know where you've been
Mmm, how is your new best friend?
And do you know I will treat you like him?
And I know


You're under my skin
Running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way that you loved me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo on my skin
Running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way that you loved me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo to remind me
A tattoo to remind me
A tattoo to remind me


Apologies for the way I've been
I couldn't wash you off my skin
No I, I couldn't live without you
Mmm, tears and eyes can dry
But I know I'm burning like the wire in light bulbs
It could be in the way you bleed me
And I know

You're under my skin
Running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way that you loved me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo on my skin
Running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way that you loved me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo to remind me
A tattoo to remind me
A tattoo to remind me




You're under my skin
Running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way that you loved me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo on my skin
Running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way that you loved me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo to remind me
A tattoo to remind me
A tattoo


Under my skin and running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way you loved me
I guess you had to leave a tattoo to remind me1Embed

4 Don’t/Loyal/No Diggity/The Next Episode/Nina LyricsI met this girl late last year
She said don't you worry if I disappear
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jump right in
A week later returned, I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause 'til the moment was right

I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10
Baby bring a lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets 'til the late AM
Baby if you wanted me then you should've just said
She's singing
Ah lah

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lah
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah
For a couple weeks I
Only want to see her
We drink away the days with a take-away pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha
All over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes the same day ah
Those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on the couch
But we should get on a plane
Or we'll be missing it now
I wish I'd have written it down
The way that things played out
When she was kissing him how
I was confused about
She should figure it out while I'm sat here singing
Ah lah

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lah
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah
(knock, knock, knock)
On my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder
I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realise what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
All this time God knows I'm singing
Ah lah

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lah
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lah
Don't fuck with my love
These girls ain't loyal
That heart is so cold
This girl ain't loyal
Ah lah

Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah

Shorty get down, good Lord
Baby got 'em open all over town
Strictly biz she don't play around
Cover much grounds
Got game by the pound
Getting paid is her forte
Each and every day true player way
I can't get her outta my mind (say what)
I think about the girl all the time
East side to the west side
Push your fat rides it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash
Stacking up the cash
Quick when it comes to the gas
By no means average
She's on when she's got to have it
Baby you're a perfect 10
I wanna get in
Lemmi get down so I can win, sing it

I like the way you work it (no diggity)
I got to bag it up
I like the way you work it (no diggity)
I got to bag it up (bag it up now)
I like the way you work it (no diggity)
I got to bag it up (bag it up)
I like the way you work it (no diggity)

Top Dogg, bite em all, yeah we burning shit up
D-P-G-C now we turning shit up
C-P-T, L-B-C, yeah we hookin back up
And when they bang this in the club baby you got to get up
Thug dealers drug dealers yeah we livin it up
My life, yo' life, boy we livin it up
Takin chances while we dancin in the party fo' sho'
Slip my hoe a forty-fo' and she got in the back do'
Bitches lookin at me strange but you know I don't care
Step up in this motherfucker just a-swangin my hair
Bitch quit talkin, quick walk if you down with the set
Take a bullet and take it down with this jet
Out of town, put it down for the Father of Rap
And if yo' ass get cracked, bitch shut yo' trap
Now get back, come back that's the part of success
If you believe in the S you'll be relievin your stress

It goes na-na-na-na-na
It's the motherfuckin D-O-double-G (snoop doooooog)
Na-na-na-na-na
You know I'm mobbin with the D.R.E

Heyo heyo heyo heyoooooo
Damn that girls looks good
Heyo heyo heyo heyoooooo
Play on, play on, play on
Heyo heyo heyo heyoooooo
Damn that girl looks good
Heyo heyo heyo heyoooooo

I met you when I was a teen
But then you were one as well
And I could play a guitar
Just like ringing a bell
Sometimes I wonder
In any other summer could you have been my part time lover
To me listening to Stevie Wonder
Under the covers where we used to lay
And re: stacks is what the speakers played
I'd be on tour almost every day
When I was home up in my flat is where we used to stay

Just watching the DVD, smoking illegal weed
Getting high as two kites when we needed to breathe
We used each other's air just for the people to see
And stayed up all night like when we needed to sleep
We'd go anywhere, our minds would take us
And I said you are beautiful without your make-up
And you don't even need to worry about your weight cause
We can all be loved the way that God made us
And time's the only reason that we could break up
Cause you would always tell me I'm away too much
Distance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane
Or make a mistake, say it again

Oh Nina
You should go Nina
'Cause I ain't never coming home
Nina oh, won't you leave me now
And I've been living on the road Nina
But then again you should know Nina
Cause that's you and me both
Nina oh, won't you leave me now
Now

And every weekend in the winter
You'd be wearing my hoodie
With draw strings pulled tight
To keep your face from the cold
Taking day trips to the local
Where we'd eat on our own
Cause every day when I was away
We'd only speak on the phone

Watching Blue Planet
Creating new habits
Then as if we were two rabbits
And then you'd vanish back to the burrow with all the Celtics
I disappear
You call me selfish, I understand
But I can't help it
I put my job over everything
Except my family and friends
But you'll be in between forever
So I guess we'll have to take a step back
Overlook the situation
Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications
And I'm not saying we should be taking a break
Just re-evaluating quick before we make a mistake and it's too late
So we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on the plane
But in a day we'll have to say it again

Oh Nina
You should go Nina
'Cause I ain't never coming home
Nina oh, won't you leave me now
And I've been living on the road Nina
But then again you should know Nina
Cause that's you and me both Nina
Uh won't you leave me now
Now

Love will come and love will go
But you can make it on your own
Sing that song, go, oh won't you leave me now
People grow, and fall apart
But you can mend your broken heart
Take it back, go, oh won't you leave me now

Oh Nina
You should go Nina
'Cause I ain't never coming home
Nina oh, won't you leave me now
And I've been living on the road Nina
And then again you should know Nina
Cause that's you and me
Both in a road, won't you leave me now
NowEmbed

3 Happier (Acoustic) Lyrics
Walking down 29th and park
I saw you in another's arm
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier
Saw you walk inside a bar
He said something to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah, you look happier, you do


Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're moving on with someone new


'Cause baby you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Hey yeah, hey yeah


Sat in the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself
You're happier, aren't you?

Oh, ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody need you like I do
I know that there's others that deserve you
But my darling, I am still in love with you


But I guess you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I’ll feel it too
I could try to smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Hey yeah, hey yeah


‘Cause baby you look happier, you do
I knew one day you’d fall for someone new
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do
Just know that I’ll be waiting here for youEmbed
4 Balance LyricsPerfect time to be trying
But we need to wait and read between the lines
Stay inside, windows dying
I don't want to see the sadness in your eyes
You could say we got a long way to go
I won't
'Cause when tomorrow comes you'll never know
And you know

And even though we're waiting on a miracle
Well I believe in us
Just be here with me and turn the world off
And that will be enough

We could take a day, imagine it
Make paper planes and fly
Stare off into space
Go to a place that all the hurt will die
Balance, all in everything
Balance, see what the dawn brings

Stage fright, need direction
Every second wasted is a little lie
Your mood is my reflection
And though I get it wrong you know I really try
Everyone around us seems to know
What we don't
Maybe in a week it'll be exposed
Let's hope
Up until now I was never spiritual
But I believe in love
Just be here with me and lay within my arms
And that will be enough

We could take a day, imagine it
Make paper planes and fly
Stare off into space
Go to a place that all the hurt will die
Balance, all in everything
Balance, see what the dawn brings

Balance, all in everything
Balance, see what the dawn brings

Perfect time to be trying
But we need to wait and read between the lines
Stay inside, windows dying
Windows dying
Windows dyingEmbed
6 Moody Ballad of Ed Lyrics
Come on now, dry your eyes
I'm sick of all your lies
I've grown to despise you
Already sick of what you're saying
Hoping now I'm only praying
My baby's gone away
And I've already packed my bags


You didn't know me
(I've run away)
You couldn't show me
(What you have to say?)
My one and only
Has gone away
Far away


You'll never leave me alone
Now I'm off on my own
I'll never ring your phone again
And still you keep on crying
If I said I loved you, I'd be lying
You need to dry your eyes
And I've still got to pack my bags

You didn't know me
(I've run away)
You couldn't show me
(What you have to say?)
My one and only
Has gone away
Far away

You didn't know me
(I've run away)
You couldn't show me
(What you have to say?)
My one and only
Has gone away
Far awayEmbed
4 In Memory Lyrics
I write this song in memory of
The wayward smile, the boy we won’t forget
The soul you took away from us
The river flows the tears that we wept


Missing you
Is all that needs to be said
More than blue
The words inside my head
And I know that you're gone
And I know that you're gone


The cheeky smile of jokes and laughs
The memories of times we crossed the line
The stepping stones across my mind
Washed away, we all now feel so blind


Missing you
Is all that needs to be said
More than blue
The words inside my head
And I know that you're gone (Goodbye)
And I know that you're gone (Goodbye)
And I know that you're gone (Goodbye)
And I know that you're gone (Goodbye)Embed
9 2step (German Remix) Lyrics
Two-steppin' with the woman I love, love
Yeah, los gehts, los gehts


I had a bad week
Spent the evening pretending it wasn't that deep (Wasn't that deep)
You could see in my eyes that it was taking over
I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment
You know you take all of my stress right down
Help me get it off my chest and out
Into the ether with the rest of this mess that just keeps us depressed
We forget that we're here right now (We forget)


'Cause we're livin' life at a different pace, stuck in a constant race
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break, something's gotta change
We should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn
If we're missin' out on what the people think is right
Seein' through a picture behind the screen and forget to be
Lose the conversation for the message that you'll never read
I think maybe you and me
Oh, we should head out to the place where the music plays
And then


We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone, then loved
And all we need is us to go all

Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us (Los geht's)


All we need is love
Doch liebe fällt so schwer bei den Problemen in mein' Kopf (Kopf)
PTSD hält mich wach am Block
Mein Herz ist 26, meine Seele 52 (Yeah)
Ich weiß, nicht alles, was ich mache, ist vernünftig (No)
Du warst so wie Weed, wir kannten uns nur flüchtig
Doch dann wurd ich süchtig, seitdem trägt das ganze Früchte
Mit dir halt' ich es einhundert, weil du warst immer echt (Real)
Ich hab' hundert K in Duffle-Bag (Bag)
Sie gibt mir ein'n Haargummi, ich pack's um die Racks
Ich weiß, spar'n wär nicht schlecht, doch

5 Lego House (Acoustic) LyricsI'm gonna pick up the pieces
And build a Lego house
When things go wrong we can knock it down
My three words have two meanings
There's one thing on my mind
It's all for you
And it's dark in a cold December, but I've got ya to keep me warm
And if you're broken I will mend ya and keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done, I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done, I think I love you better now
I'm gonna paint you by numbers
And colour you in
If things go right we can frame it, and put you on a wall
And it's so hard to say it but I've been here before
And I'll surrender up my heart
And swap it for yours
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done, I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done, I think I love you better now
Don't hold me down
I think my braces are breaking and it's more than I can take
And it's dark in a cold December, but I've got ya to keep me warm
And if you're broken I will mend ya and keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done, I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done, I think I love you better now
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done, I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done, I think I love you better now
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done, I will love you better nowEmbed
6 Bad Habits (MEDUZA Remix) Lyrics
Yeah


Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful


My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to you
My bad habits lead to you


You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
We, we, we, we, we


We took the long way 'round
Burned 'til the fun ran out, now

Every purе intention ends when thе good times start
Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
It started under neon lights and then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far


My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to you
My bad habits lead to you


You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
We, we, we, we, weEmbed
2 Take It Back (SBTV extended version) LyricsI'm not a rapper I'm a singer with a flow
I've got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics you know
You'll find me ripping the written out of the pages they sit in
I never want to get bitten
'Cause plagiarism is hidden
Watch how I sit on the rhythm
Prisoner with a vision
Signs of a label
But didn't listen to any criticism
Thought you knew but you didn't
So perk your ears up and listen
Studio is a system
And you could say that I'm driven
And now it's onto the next saga
We drink the best lager
I'll never try to win you over like your stepfather
I do my own thing now
And get respect after
And I'm avoiding the 'caine
Like it was Get Carter
For four years I never had a place to stay
But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded
Like a paper weight
At 16 years old yeah I moved out of my home
I was Macy Gray I tried to say goodbye and I choked
Went from sleeping at a subway station
To sleeping with a movie star
And adding to the population
Not my imagination
I don't wanna relax
Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax?
I take it back now
Mmmm come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No

I take it back with the rhythm and blues
With my rap pack I'll be singing the news
Tryna act like Jack Black
When I bring it to school
I make a beat with my feet
By just hittin' the loop
Bringing the lyrics to prove
That I can fit in these shoes
I give you the truth through the vocal booth
And stars burst out on the scene
Like an opal fruit
They try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot
But then again that's what they're supposed to do
And I'm supposed to be calm
I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm
Whispering everything that happens
Is from now on
I'll be ready to start again
By the end of the song
This is like claiming I handled it wrong
But then I've never had an enemy
Except the NME but I'll be selling
Twice as many copies as their magazines'll ever be
With only spectacles ahead of me
And festival fees are healthier than a Dalmatian on Pedigree
Singing for the masses rubber dingied rapids
I keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic
I'm battling for respect and I don't know if I have it
This song's from the heart cover the planet
I take it back now
Mmmm come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No
And take it back now

Now I don't ever wanna be perfect
'Cause I'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless
And I accept the fact that someone's got to win worst dressed
Taking my first steps into the scene giving me focus
Putting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton
Considering a name change thinking it was hopeless
Rhyming over recordings, avoiding tradition
'Cause every day some lyrics and a melody could be written
Now absence can make your heart ache
But drinking absinthe can change your mind state
Vividly need to let my liver be
And I'll say it again living life on the edge with a close handful of friends
Is good advice from the man that took his life on the road with me
And I hope to see him blowing up globally
'Cause that's how it's supposed to be
I'm screaming out vocally
It might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams
But, but I just write schemes
I'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans
Madison Square Garden is where I might be
But more likely
You find me
In the back room of a dive bar with my mates
Having a pint with McDaid
Discussing records we made
And every single second knowing
That we'll never betray
The way we were raised
Remembering our background
Sat down
That's how we plan it out
It's time to take it back now
Mmmm come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No

Mmm come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No

My dreams keep me awake at night
Written in rhymes, 'til I deliver the hype
Am I just living the lie
With this you must know that the number's just sold whoa
Will keep me going through the tough times, dream with me
We forget 90 per cent of it when we wake
But the other 10 per cent it never fades
Dreaming dreams, day to day goals
Stay awake loads, try to make the cut like the
Paper or razor blade, oh, never give up
And just remember just to hold out more
A couple years ago
I couldn't just control that thought
You'd find me buskin' on the street
When it was cold outdoors
And now I'm sweating on the stage of a sold out tour
Writing love songs for the sake of it
Never to make a hit
You can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick
I'm not a rapper I'm a singer, I just take the piss and
Most of these other guys are kids that Pulses
Little sister has to babysit, that's just the way it is
Dreams you own, just set your goals
And have the utmost faith in it; tread your own path
You'll never make it as a follower, you'll never know
Where you will go or where you will be tomorrow rha1Embed
1 ContributorYou Need Me LyricsNow I'm in town, break it down
Thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That's you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus, as I sing to you loud
And I can't, no, I won't hush
I'll say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now

See, I'm true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
I'm real, I do it all, it's all me
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me

'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you

You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me
I sing and write my own tune
And I write my own verse? Hell
Don't need another wordsmith to make my tune sell?
Call yourself a singer-writer
You're just bluffing
Your name's on the credits and you didn't write nothing
I sing fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to Brit School
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can't last if I'm smoking on a crack pipe

And I won't be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia
And musically I'm demonstrating
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the Enterprise when some fella filmed me
"A young singer-writer like Gabriella Cilmi"

'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you

You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me
Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right
I won't stop till my name's in light
At Stadium Heights with Damien Rice
On red carpets, now I'm on Arabian nights
Because I'm young and all my brothers gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I'm gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter
The games over but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal

People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows
But I haven't got a house plus I live on the couch
So you can read the lyrics when I'm singing them out
Wow

From day one, I've been prepared
With vo5 wax for my ginger hair
So now I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of what the future holds
Cause it's another day
Plus I'll keep my last name forever keep the genre pretty basic

Gonna be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rappers shoes using new laces
Selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the majors
Nationwide 'til we're Just Jack, soon as I get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago
But more people hear me though
According to the Myspace and YouTube videos
I'm always doing shows, if I'm not I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up call me Ruffio
Melody music maker
Reading all the papers
They say I'm up-and-coming like I'm fucking in an elevator
Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you

You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need youEmbed
6 I’m Glad I’m Not You Lyrics
It’s been a while since we were here
Been too long my fear is
Holding back the memories of your eyes
Scattered notes and broken glass you had left for  me
All that’s left is shattered hearts
It’s plain enough for us to see that
You’ve got me
You’ve got me


We’re just friends tangled up in loose ends
I feel it coming around again
Let me know where you let your heart go
And I will just pretend
That I have never felt this way
Since you I have never felt this way
Since you
I feel strange
Playing games
It’s no fuss
I’m not in love


Twisted tunes, a melody of spite
If you give me the words then I might
Let go unknown feelings
Telling me that I cannot fight
When you speak that shite
Let go unknown feelings
Telling me that
You’ve got me
You’ve got me

We’re just friends tangled up in loose ends
I feel it coming around again
Let me know where you let your heart go
And I will just pretend
That I have never felt this way
Since you I have never felt this way
Since you
I feel strange
Playing games
It’s no fuss
I’m not in love


I lost it in your kiss, your lips
Sweetness, in your smile
Your words make me whole
But your scars demand a healer’s touch
It’s true
I’m glad I’m not you3Embed
2 She Looks So Perfect Lyrics
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey hey


Simmer down, simmer down
They say we’re too young now to amount to anything else
But look around
We worked too damn hard for this just to give it up now
If you don’t swim, you’ll drown
But don’t move, honey


You look so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now that I’m so down
Your lipstick stain is a work of art
I got your name tattooed in an arrow heart
And I know now that I’m so down
Hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey


Let’s get out, let’s get out
'Cause this deadbeat town’s only here just to keep us down
While I was out
I found myself alone just thinking
If I showed up with a plane ticket
And a shiny diamond ring with your name on it
Would you wanna run away too?
'Cause all I really want is you

You look so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now that I’m so down
I made a mixtape straight out of ‘94
I’ve got your ripped skinny jeans lying on the floor
And I know now that I’m so down
Hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey


You look so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now that I'm so down
Your lipstick stain is a work of art
I got your name tattooed in an arrow heart
And I know now that I’m so down


Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
You look so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now that I’m so down (hey, hey)
Your lipstick stain is a work of art
I got your name tattooed in an arrow heart
And I know now that I’m so down
Hey, heyEmbed
4 2step (French Remix) Lyrics
I had a bad week
Spent the evening pretending it wasn't that deep
You could see in my eyes that it was taking over
I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment
You know you take all of my stress right down
Help me get it off my chest and out
Into the ether with the rest of this mess that just keeps us depressed
We forget that we're here right now


'Cause we're livin' life at a different pace, stuck in a constant race
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break, something's gotta change
We should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn
If we're missin' out on what the people think is right
Seein' through a picture behind the screen and forget to be
Lose the conversation for the message that you'll never read
I think maybe you and me
Oh, we should head out to the place where the music plays
And then


We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time (Mmh)
But we know what it feels to be low, then up, alone, then loved
And all we need is us to go all

Night, night (Mmh)
Two-steppin' with the woman I love (Mmh)
Night, yeah
All we need is us (Mmh)


Elle me donne beaucoup plus de love depuis qu'j'suis dans le top stream (Love)
Je souris plus trop car mes émotions se supplient (Car mes émotions se supplient)
C'est vrai qu'j'ai beaucoup d'choses à perdre mais c'est tout pour la gagne
Que le bon Dieu me pardonne
Oh no (Mmh), ça fait qu'empirer ('pirer)
Toute une famille qui sèche ses larmes devant les huissiers (Oh no)
Grandi là où c'est chaud mais j'ai soigné mes bobos en encaissant du seille-o
On cache nos faiblesses pour pas finir manipuler
R.I.P aux soldats qu'on a perdu en cours de route (R.I.P aux soldats)
Constamment donner de l'amour


We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time (Mmh)
But we know what it feels to be low, then up, alone, then loved
And all we need is us to go all (Yeah)

Night, night (Mmh)
Two-steppin' with the woman I love (Mmh)
Night, yeah
All we need is us (Mmh)


Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us to go all night
Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us to go all nightEmbed
4 Way Home Lyrics
Well I once heard a story 'bout a run-down home
Where a man and his thoughts lived all alone
He tried to live, no effort was shown
He's slowly finding a way back home


He had a nice family with smiles and frowns
They never could solve his way to be down
'Cause he's one dog who don't want a bone
He's slowly finding a way back home
He had a nice house with windows and doors
He said to his wife "What's mine is yours"
But the seeds of deception are soon to be sown
He's slowly finding a way back home
His children have left but the rooms are still there
His misses the noise and the scents in their hair
But far from the nest the babies have flown
He's slowly finding a way back home
His wife was an angel sent from above
He never returned her kisses or love
But soon he'd found that she'd overgrown
This man who's finding a way back home
So the leaves are all dead in this broken man's June
The rain will still fall on the sunny afternoon
He stares at the floor, no more to roam
He's slowly finding a way back home

Well I once heard a story 'bout a run-down home
Where a man with regrets lived all alone
He tried to live, no effort was shown
He'll never find his way back homeEmbed
4 The A Team (Acoustic) Lyrics
White lips, pale face
Breathing in the snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, day's end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men


And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us


Cause she's just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple of grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly

Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone


And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us


Cause she's just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple of grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly

An angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eyes and hoping for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line


And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us


And we're all under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple of grams
And we don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
Fly, fly
For angels to fly
To fly, to fly
For angels to dieEmbed
5 Typical Average Lyrics
Strings on my guitar are rusty
Even my best friends don't trust me
Everybody thinks I must be crazy


Cause, I'm your typical average teen
If you know what I mean
(Typical average teen)
Cause, I'm your typical average teen
If you know what I mean

Everything's in a haze
Yeah, the drink's got me in a daze
Everything's blurry
Oh, what's happened to me?


Say, I'm your typical average teen
If you know what I mean

Now, I'm your typical average teen
If you know what I mean

4 Smile Lyrics
Just give me a pen and I’ll write my worries
Now and again I’ll try and not see that you don’t care
Taking the time to taste and savour
Life’s bitter wine and childish behaviour
But you don’t care


And hey, I don’t speak that language of youth
And hey, oh not the one that speaks truth
And hey, I lay in this world for a while
When all is lost just smile


They’ve written the dates and the times to follow
See all the fakes that look so hollow
But you don’t care
What ever happened to the youth and culture?
Wear chains and the same fecking Lonsdale jumper
So you don’t care

1 ContributorGrow Back LyricsFell out of love with her
Just to trip straight back in
Times like this don’t come round here
And chances are slim

But eventually
You’ll be mine

Love stole my sympathy
When she belonged to him
But now I will feel the soft touch of her lips again
But chances are slim

But eventually
You’ll be mine
I won’t miss a thing
If you’re mine

I don’t care if you’re lost
Cause in our hearts we both know that
We both know that

All I see, is you
And I miss this
And we can't see this through
We can’t fix this
Love
It won't grow back
She said it's time for a quick cigarette by the bike shed
She asked me if I’d regret it all and I said
I replied no love this about as far as it goes
See me going by the thought of you and it shows
She said you weren’t even listening
I might be too much right now man it’s sickening
Can’t believe I’m running from her
I’m stranded, her beauty is too much to bear
And oh I think I want her
And oh I swear she’s never been deep in before
And oh I think I need her
I can’t tell her I want her it's not right in summer
I think that I need her

I won’t miss a thing
If you’re mine
I don’t care if you’re lost
Cause in our hearts we both know that
We both know that

All I see is you
And I miss this
And we can't see this through
We can’t fix this
All I see is you
And I miss this
And we can't see this through
We can’t fix this
Love, it won't grow back
Your love hit me like a punch in the nose
Baby your love deals the hardest blowsEmbed
5 Yellow Pages Lyrics
I felt the fall on my breast
At the bottom of my stomach
She put my hand on her chest
While she looked into my eyes
You rescued me
And called up these words in threes
And you know I can’t forget it
And 10 months on you liberate truth
See, I was wrong on how I hate you
And it’s the worst thing that I did


When I read through you
You weren’t translated
So I looked up love in the Yellow Pages
So I’d be free from it


See, all this truth sparks lies in me
Just to demonstrate, aggravate sympathy
The key is just to ignore
Even if this time has made me unsure
And 12 months on I’m back in my mood
See, I got drunk and said I loved you
And it’s the worst thing that I did

8 Sara Lyrics
Sara, what you do is enlighten my mind
Oh wow, I said
Sara, what you do is make my soul unwind


Hey now ‘Cos your hair is blonde, your eyes are blue
Half the guys I know are after you
Cheer me up when I’m in a mood
So I thought I’d write a song for you


And may I say, you look like an angel today
May I say, take me to the place where your mind lays
If only to make you smile today
‘Cos you are great, I thought I’d say that


Sara, reminds me of drunken talks in a hammock
Behind a can of Strongbow
Oh wow, I said
Sara, you say that you don’t look good when you do
Even with that soul


Your hair is blonde, your eyes are blue
Half the guys I know are after you
Cheer me up when I’m in a mood
So I thought I’d write a song for you

And may I say, you look like an angel today
May I say, take me to the place where your mind lays
If only to make you smile today
‘Cos you are great, I thought I’d say that


May I say, you look great
May I play this to make your dayEmbed
5 The A Team (Live at the Bedford) Lyrics
Hello, everyone! Yay, we're so near the time for Ed! It's so exciting! Woohoo! Um... just wanted to say a couple more things: just remember that we are filming this for a DVD that you guys are going to be able to buy and tonight is being recorded for a live EP that you guys will also be able to buy so... I think we'd all agree that we're all a part of something really special because we're going to be able to take tonight home in a few weeks (cheering) So yeah, big honor for us all to be here and... I just want to personally say a big thank-you to Ed for asking me to um-- host tonight because it's just amazing and I think he's fantastic and I feel honored to be here. So that's it! It's time to welcome the fantastic Ed Sheeran to the stage. Make some noise!


White lips, pale face
Breathing in the snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, day's end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men


And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us


Cause she's just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple of grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly

Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone


And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us


Cause she's just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple of grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly

An angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eyes and hoping for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line


And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us


And we're all under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple of grams
And we don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
Fly, fly
For angels to fly
To fly, to fly
For angels to dieEmbed
4 You Need to Cut Your Hair Lyrics
Well I walked from my house to yours
In a warm cold April rain
We barely went outdoors
And your family took the blame
Take time to be with you
She can only glare
I’m a bad influence, that’ll do
‘Cos I need to cut my hair
Wash my mouth, change my clothes
Just don’t talk to those friends of yours
Tell them not to come here anymore
Time to go, don’t be slow
This’ll only take a mo’
Take yourself right out of my door


It’s just that they don’t care
Dad said beware, watch your back
Just don’t reply to that woman there
And even if she makes a fuss
Just ignore that trust
And don’t give in to lust
And leave that one alone
The girl’s trouble

Time spent in burnt-down shed
Add up near two days
Fall down and cut my head
Take time to misbehave
Spend time and be with you
She can only glare
‘Cos you’re a bad influence, that’ll do
Boy you need to cut your hair
Wash your mouth, change your clothes
Just don’t talk to those friends of yours
Tell them not to come here anymore
Time to go, don’t be slow
This’ll only take a mo’
Take yourself right out of my door




This is the dancing song
Close your eyes
Hypnotise to the beat
And the movement of the week
Do that shuffle of your feet
And pound out the fever, either
Dance as you’re a true believer
Cleaner lives are what you don’t see
Fell the weight, gravitate
Feel the pace of me
This world is 2D
The only thing that’s free in life is love
And that don’t come cheap

5 The West Coast of Clare LyricsSorrow and sadness, bitterness, grief
Memories I have of you
Won't leave me in peace
My mind was running back
To the west coast of Clare
Thinking of you
And the times we had there

I walked to Spanish Point
I knew I'd find you there
I stood on the white strand
You were everywhere
Vivid memories fade
But the mood still remains
I wish I could go back
And be with you again

In Milltown there's a pub
It’s there that I sat down
I see you everywhere
Your face is all around
The search for times past
Contains such sweet pain
I'll banish lonesome thoughts
But they’ll return again
I walk along the shore
The rain in my face
My mind is numb with grief
Of you there is no trace
I'll think of this again
In far off lands I roam
Walking with you
By this cold Atlantic fog

Sorrow and sadness, bitterness, grief
Memories I have of you
Won't leave me in peace
My mind was running back
To the west coast of Clare
Thinking of you
And the times we had thereEmbed
5 The City (Live at the Bedford) Lyrics
This city never sleeps
I hear the people walk by when it's late
Sirens bleed through my windowsill
I can't close my eyes
Can't control what I'm into
This tower is alive
The lights that blind keep me awake
With my hood up and lace untied
Sleep fills my mind
Can't control what I'm into


London calls me a stranger
A traveler
This is now my home, my home


I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps
Then that makes two


The pavement is my friend
And it will take me where I need to go
I find it trips me up
And puts me down
This is not what I'm used to
The shop across the road
Fulfills my needs and gives me company
When I need it
Voices speak through my walls
I don't think I'm gonna make it
Past tomorrow

London calls me a stranger
A traveler
This is now my home, my home


I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps
Then that makes two


And my lungs hurt
And my ears bled
With the sound of the city life
Echoed in my head
Do I need this to keep me alive?
The traffic stops and starts
But I need to move along


I’m from a city where the rain won’t cease
Pollution in the air matches that on the street
The black smoke gets your head into a muddle, like
Walking into elephant syringes in the puddle, like
I was a country boy when I moved out
Grew up too fast for my family to find out
Now I try to stop my music running into nosedives
Can’t resort to arrogance with white lies
This city won’t erase me
But I can’t help to see how this dark city changed me
It’s all the same see, music is my life, but
Now I try to fight whatever I need to hide from
North, South, East, West, London’s my home now
Knees weak, but we never slow down
Now I start to do my music properly
And stay from all the negative shit that will follow me

London calls me a stranger
This is not my home, home


I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps
Then that makes two


I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps
Then that makes two

That was fun!Embed
4 Misery Lyrics
Well, I've walked this street
Well, I've walked this street before
And everyone's locked up their door
Cause they heard me coming
And I've been running
From what?


I don't know if she's there
Or if she cares
It's taken you a long time to see
You've got a goldfish memory
This song's for you, not for me
In misery


You said we went too fast
And you said we wouldn't last
Now I've put the past behind me
And I'm running
From what?


I don't know if she's there
Or if she cares
It's taken you a long time to see
You've got a goldfish memory
This song's for you, not for me
In misery

It's taken you a long time to see
In misery
And everyone's locked up their door
Cause they heard me coming
And I've been running
From what?


I don't know if she's there
Or if she cares
It's taken you a long time to see
You've got a goldfish memory
This song's for you, not for me
In misery


You said we went too fast
And you said we wouldn't last
Now I've put the past behind me
And I'm running
From what?


I don't know if she's there
Or if she cares
It's taken you a long time to see
You've got a goldfish memory
This song's for you, not for me
In misery

It's taken you a long time to see
In misery1Embed
5 2step (UK Remix) Lyrics
I know I promised you the world when I didn't have it
You say I'm a liar, I don't care but that's a bit dramatic
You know I've got enough stress, I'm living post-traumatic
I know we're bigger than a picture or a silly caption
I like you in real life, I'm bendin' over backwards
And love the way you love me, I find you so attractive
Flight mode, we don't need no distractions
And we ain't walkin' down the street unless you hold my handgun
Maybe I'm just a schmuck who really can't believe his luck
But he's just hopin' he's enough, feel like me, we had it hard
So we learned to adjust and take thе smooth with the rough
Your skin's smooth to the touch, I got juice in my cup
Shе know I ain't like them fools in the club
I'm grindin' so we got a house on the hill
A boat for the cane and a pool for the a tub
'Til then I'm two-steppin' in the mud


We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone, then loved
And all we need is us to go all

Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us


What do you reckon, is it just me?
Words are weapons and occasionally they cut deep
Crisis of confidence, it tends to come when I feel the dark and I open my heart
If you don't see it, you should trust me
I feel like I got nothin' left right now
Except this beauty in her dress right now
She got me feelin' like the best, and the rest are just less than she needs
So we press play and step to the beat


'Cause we're livin' life at a different pace, stuck in a constant race
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break, something's gotta change
We should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn
Head out to the place where it plays and


We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone and loved
And all we need is us to go all

Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us to go all night
Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us to go all nightEmbed
7 Diary Lyrics
Your love is the strongest thing I know
I reckon it's been doing weights
Eating raw eggs in its cereal
And running ten miles a day
And your love has a driving ban
From trying to steer intoxicated with another love inside her hands
And your love is a friend of mine
So we'll take it care tonight


If you could only say the words
I'd take it and I'd write it down
And hold it deep inside of me
Until the day you found me out
But I know your love
And that's why


I could be your diary
Baby if you open me up
Keep it inside me
I'll give you the world
Just give me the words
And I could be your diary
Baby if you open me up
Keep it inside me
I'll give you the world
Just give me the words

And your love
Has never been my enemy
Used to hold me
And promise it would never leave
Never been better since all the therapy
To read the words between the lines
And take away my melody
And your love
Told me it was turning to a different page
And you know, if I let you go
I'll still keep you safe






You are the one I fall asleep with
But never wake up to
Cause work is something you must do
I trust you like you trust me
It must mean true love
It does exactly what it says on the tin
Let me begin
You are the one I watch the movies with
For recognizing my love for Kiera Knightley for what it truly is
Just an excuse so I don't have to watch Love Actually again
But you're actually the same
It's just to spite me
And we eat ice-cream with fishes in it
Until the dishes finished
Playing computer games although I know I'll never win it
I tried to make tea once for you in bed
But all I did was spill it
So you made it for me instead
Let me in bed
If you get in ahead of me
It's better to do
Yeah, love is ahead of the truth
But in love
We are better in two
I'll be the newcomer
Stuck in heaven with the devil in you

1 ContributorLast Night LyricsI went out late last night
And cold air met me
Lost a grip on my shoes
Walked home in bare feet

And I'll stay awake
Till the morning greets me
And I'll stay away, out

Tonight, this day won't end
The fire keep burning now

I'm never gonna leave here, tonight
I'm here again, the fire keeps burning now
I'm never gonna leave here

Let the dark cover me
And hold me tight
Hear the words in my sleep
Close your eyes for a second life within

And I'll stay awake till the morning greets me
And I'll stay away out, tonight

This day won't end, the fire keeps burning out
I'm never gonna leave here, tonight I'm here again
The fire keeps burning out
I'm never gonna leave here
Outside, in the winter, in the cold, I have not been asked where to go, and so, oh
I am here alone, waiting for tonight, waiting for tonight
And day, to end, the fire is burning now

I ain't ever gonna leave here now, and I'm here again
Oh, oh I ain't ever gonna leave here

Tonight, I'm out to meet ya
Tonight, I will feel no cold
Tonight, I'll ignore that my feet hurt
And I'll be no more, without youEmbed
4 Fear LyricsIs this a joke that no one's laughing at?
Throwing good energy after bad
Take the credit and then fade to black
I guess this time it's going outside
You take the beating they give
But you didn't do anything criminal
They live in a bubble that nothing can penetrate
Never allowing to slip at all
You're only human, they bleed just like you do
And you're not immune to their ridicule
If they have a thought don't mean that it's right
Because they said out loud, now

Fear is a joy killer
So fuck what they say
No winnеr, lost spirit
From words on our page
They only say you can't do
When thеy can't do it
Don't let it get to you babe
Fear is a joy killer
So fuck what they say

Don't let the dark around us get to you
You were born incredible and free
A wise one can argue or respect a fool
From far away it's difficult who you see
You keep your mouth shut
Head down trying to deal with all the subliminals
Avoid any trouble
Don't giving in to the hate
You cannot play but their hidden rules
You're only human, they bleed just like you do
And you're not immune to their ridicule
If they have a thought don't mean that it's right
Because they said out loud, now
Fear is a joy killer
So fuck what they say
No winner, lost spirit
From words on our page
They only say you can't do
When they can't do it
Don't let it get to you babe
Fear is a joy killer
So fuck what they say

Woo-oo-oo-oo-oo
So fuck what they say
Woo-oo-oo-oo-oo

Fear is a joy killer
So fuck what they say
No winner, lost spirit
From words on our page
They only say you can't do
When they can't do it
Don't let it get to you babe
Fear is a joy killer
So fuck what they say

Woo-oo-oo-oo-oo
So fuck what they say
Woo-oo-oo-oo-oo

3 Beyond the Pale Lyrics
Just lay it all down on me
It’s getting harder for me to breathe
Just want to know if it will be
Just want to know if it is me


And you know I’ve learned from my mistakes
And how much have I got to lose?
You find my heart is hard to break
Can’t keep playing the fool


Breathe in, exhale
To turn to move beyond the pale
Flag up, set sail
To find what’s there beyond the pale


I feel like I’ve gone to the end of the world
What do I have to do?





What can I do
Just to let you know
That you’re in my mind?
To try and justify
The way you liberate me
Every timeEmbed
3 Scars Lyrics
You've got scars on your body and your soul
Bruises on your back now
Broken heart with nowhere to go
Living in a high-rise flat
Torn apart, so keep on keeping it together
Nothing is forever you know
You can start again like this, like this


Now I see blood in the sky
Blood in my eyesight
And everything's turning to red
So we'll beat it away, color the nightlife
And light me up, burn me today
I'm seeing blood in the skyline
Stuck in the right mind
Afraid again to leave any dream
And replace it with anything better
So get up
And take away your scars


You can never be alone if you're bleeding with the skyline
Waiting for the right time
When the night's already gone
It's been traveling without your mind now
Let it let go and fuel you like petrol
You find so much beauty in what makes you mental
Your friends know it's only
A state of mind, you're only getting by
By always getting high, that's why

Now I see blood in the sky
Blood in my eyesight
And everything's turning to red
So we'll beat it away, color the nightlife
And light me up, burn me today
I'm seeing blood in the skyline
Stuck in the right mind
Afraid again to leave any dream
And replace it with anything better
So get up
And take away your scars


I can take away your scars
I can take away your scars2Embed
2 Beautiful People (Acoustic) Lyrics
L.A. on a Saturday night in the summer
Sundown and they all come out
Lamborghinis and their rented Hummers
The party's on, so they're headin' downtown
Everybody's lookin' for a come up
And they wanna know what you're about
Me in the middle with the one I love and
We're just tryna figure everything out


We don't fit in well 'cause we are just ourselves
I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
This is my only fear: that we become


Beautiful people
Drop top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
"What d'you do?" and "Who d'you know?"
Inside the world of beautiful people
Champagne and rolled-up notes
Prenups and broken homes
Surrounded, but still alone
Let's leave the party

That's not who we are (We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful
Yeah, that's not who we are (We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful


Mmm, L.A. drove for hours last night and we made it nowhere
I see stars in your eyes when we're halfway there
I'm not fazed by all them lights and flashin' cameras
'Cause with my arms around you, there's no need to care


We don't fit in well, cause we are just ourselves
I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
This is my only fear: that we become


Beautiful people
Drop top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
"What d'you do?" and "Who d'you know?"
Inside the world of beautiful people
Champagne and rolled-up notes
Prenups and broken homes
Surrounded, but still alone
Let's leave the party

That's not who we are (We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful, yeah
Yeah, that's not who we are (We are, we are, we are)

We are, we are, we are

7 2step (Indian Remix) Lyrics
I had a bad week
Spent the evening pretending it wasn't that deep
You could see in my eyes that it was taking over
I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment
You know you take all of my stress right down
Help me get it off my chest and out
Into the ether with the rest of this mess that just keeps us depressed
We forget that we're here right now


'Cause we're livin' life at a different pace, stuck in a constant race
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break, something's gotta change
We should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn
If we're missin' out on what the people think is right
Seein' through a picture behind the screen and forget to be
Lose the conversation for the message that you'll never read
I think maybe you and me
Oh, we should head out to the place where the music plays
And then


We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone, then loved
And all we need is us to go all

Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us


बातें मुझे कुछ हैं कहनी
रोका ख़ुदको है मैंने कई बार, अब लगता है बोल दूँ
जिनको भी है ग़लतफ़हमी
चलो, उनकी भी आँखें अब मैं खोल दूँ
जो भी मैं हूँ, मेरे दम पे
हाथ रखा ना किसी ने मेरे सर पे
जीते दिल मैंने काम से
जुड़ गए हज़ारों-लाखों fans मेरे नाम से
दिल से जो गाया मैंने गीत तो हटाया मुझे उनसे
उमर में हूँ छोटा, थक गया था सुन-सुन के
चल, जाने दे ना, यार, मुझे मिल गया तेरा प्यार


So, we'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time (Dips and falls in our time)
But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone, then loved
And all we need is us to go all

Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us to go all night
Night, night

1 ContributorForever Lyrics(intro)

Ooooh darlin' (x4)

(Verse 1)

Its 4AM beneath the stars under the night,
and you're here, and you're here.

With candles lit the room is dark the moon is light,
we can lay here, we can love here...



Forever,
is all i ever want,
so be careful,
when you're giving it to someone.

Ooooh darlin' (x2)

(Verse 2)

I bought some food, a change of clothes, a little wine,
and a blanket,
and we used them all...
I dreamt the day away on a planet full of life,
and just stayed there,
i fell in love there.



Perfect comes near,
perfect just for one,
and forever, is all i ever want,
so be careful,
when you're giving it to someone.

Ooooh darlin' (x2)

We're lying down her cheek is resting on my shoulder,
play with her hair, i adore her.
This is the single sweetest love I've ever known yeah,
we can stay here, run away dear.



Love knows no fear,
Father doubted some,
forever, is all i ever want,
so be careful,
when you're giving it to someone.

1 ContributorDon’t 
I met this girl late last year
She said, "Don't you worry if I disappear"
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, "I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in bеtween the sheets till the late AM"
Baby, if you wantеd me then you should have just said, she's singing


Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

And for a couple weeks, I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before, a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But, me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him, how I was confused about
Now she should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing


Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

(Knock, knock, knock) on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next (You bastard)
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat (You bastard)
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realized what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late, if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singing


Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babeEmbed
2 Perfect Duet (Live) Lyrics
I found a love for me
Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me
’Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowin' what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine


Baby, I’m dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, "Darling, you look perfect tonight"


Well, I found a man stronger than anyone I know
I shares his dreams, I hope that someday we'll share a home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are just kids, but we're so in love
Fightin' against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be your girl, you'll be my man
And I see my future in your eyes

And, baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight




Baby, I’m dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, while listenin’ to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And (he/she) looks perfect tonight
You look perfect tonightEmbed
5 Don’t (Don Diablo Remix) LyricsAh- la-la-la-la-la
I met this girl, i late last year
She said dont you worry if I disappear
I told her Im not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend
Thinking that the trouble would wait
But then, I jump right in a week later return
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time, for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause
Until the moment was right
I went away for months
Until our paths crossed again
She told me I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10
Baby bring a lemon and a bottle of gin
We´ll be in between the sheets until the late AM
Baby if you wanted me then you should´ve just said
Shes singing
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
Dont fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I dont wanna know that, babe
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
Dont fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I dont wanna know that, babe
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
For a couple weeks i
Only want to see her
We drink away the days with a take away pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now shes staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha
All over the track like a feature
Never want to sleep I guess that I dont want to either
But me and her we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes the same day
Those shows have never been what its about
But maybe well go together and just figure it out
Id rather put on a film with you and sit on the couch
But we should get on a plane or well be missing it now
Wish Id have written it down the way that things played out
When she was kissing him How?!
I was confused about
She should figure it out while Im sat here singing
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
Dont fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I dont wanna know that, babe
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
Dont fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I dont wanna know that, babe
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
*Knock, knock, knock* on my hotel door
I dont even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder
I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed thats all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course
Its not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun
And I thought you were different
This is not the way you realize
What you wanted
Its a bit too much, too late if Im honest
All this time God knows Im singing
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
Dont fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I dont wanna know that, babe
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
Dont fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I dont wanna know that, babe
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
Dont fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I dont wanna know that, babe
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
Dont fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I dont wanna know that, babe
Ah- la-la-la-la-laEmbed
4 Insomniac’s Lullaby Lyrics
I'm getting very edgy
'Cause you're trying to take this from me
And it’s something that I wanted so bad
'Cause you're the definition
Of someone who has to ruin
The best thing that I ever had
'Cause you're a jealous girl, and all I can say is
It’s your fault but partially mine (Your fault but partially mine)
For losing hope, for not treating you right
But that will disappear in time


All I gotta do is pass you by
Never say what's wrong whenever I say "Why?"


Standing in the corner
Shadowed by the light
To you I seem much smaller
But I know it might be you
How much better could I do
To be myself, not someone else?
I’m losing sleep, I live only for the week


I've grown to ignore you
'Cause when I seem to bore you
You pretend that you’re not interested
Your eyes start to twinkle
Your smile starts to widen
And I just seem to try and forget
But you pay me no attention
Even though I do (Even though I do)
But I don’t care as long as you’re mine
It’s happening every time

All I gotta do is pass you by
Never say what's wrong whenever I say "Why?"


Standing in the corner
Shadowed by the light
To you I seem much smaller
But I know it might be you
How much better could I do
To be myself, not someone else?
I’m losing sleep, I live only for the week


And I'm falling harder now it seems
My slip-ups haunt me in my dreams
And I can't sleep although I think I can
It's insomnia I think I have
But who cares when I'm not your man?


Standing in the corner
Shadowed by the light
To you I seem much smaller
But I know it might be you
How much better could I do
To be myself, not someone else?
I’m losing sleep, I live only for the weekEmbed
1 ContributorTake It Back / Superstition / Ain’t No Sunshine LyricsI'm not a rapper I'm a singer with a flow
I've got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics you know
You'll find me ripping the written out of the pages they sit in
I never want to get bitten
Cause plagiarism is hidden
Watch how I sit on the rhythm
Prisoner with a vision
Signs of a label
But didn't listen to any criticism
Thought you knew but you didn't
So perk your ears up and listen
Studio is a system
And you could say that I'm driven
And now it's onto the next saga
We drink the best lager
I'll never try to win you over like your stepfather
I do my own thing now
And get respect after
And I'm avoiding the 'caine
Like it was Get Carter
For four years I never had a place to stay
But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded
Like a paper weight
At 16 years old yeah I moved out of my home
I was Macy Gray I tried to say goodbye and I choked
Went from sleeping at a subway station
To sleeping with a movie star
And adding to the population
Not my imagination
I don't wanna relax
Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax?
I take it back now
Mmmm come on and take it back love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love
No

I take it back with the rhythm and blues
With my rap pack I'll be singing the news
Tryin' act like Jack Black
When I bring it to school
I make a beat with my feet
By just hittin' the loop
Bringing the lyrics to prove
That I can fit in these shoes
I give you the truth through the vocal booth
And stars burst out on the scene
Like an opal fruit
They try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot
But then again that's what they're supposed to do
And I'm supposed to be calm
I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm
Whispering everything that happens
Is from now on
I'll be ready to start again
By the end of the song
Since they are claiming I handled it wrong
But then I've never had an enemy
Except the NME but I'll be selling
Twice as many copies as their magazine will ever be
With only spectacles ahead of me
And festival fees are healthier than a Dalmatian on pedigree
Singing for the masses rubber dingied rapids
I keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic
I'm battling for respect and I don't know if I have it
This song's from the heart cover the planet
I take it back now
Mmmm come on and take it back love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love
No
And take it back now

Now I don't ever wanna be perfect
Cause I'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless
And I accept the fact that someone's got to win worst dressed
Taken my first steps into the scene giving me focus
Putting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton
Considering a name change thinking it was hopeless
Rhyming over recordings, avoiding tradition
'Cause every days some lyrics and a melody can be written
Now absence can make your heart ache
But drinking absinth can change your mind state
Vividly need to let my liver be
And I'll say it again living life on the edge with a close handful of friends
Is good advice from the man that took his life on the road with me
And I hope to see him blowing up globally
'Cause that how it's supposed to be
I'm screaming out vocally
It might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams
But, but I just write schemes
I'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans
Madison Square Garden is where I might be
But more likely you find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates
Having a pint of McDaid discussing records we made
And every single second knowing that we'll never betray
The way we were raised remembering our background sat down, that's how we plan it out
It's time to take it back now
Mmmm come on and take it back love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love
No

Mmm come on and take it back love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love
No

Very superstitious, writings on the wall
Very superstitious, ladders bout' to fall
Thirteen month old baby, broke the lookin' glass
Seven years of bad luck, the good things in your past

Believing things that you don't understand
Then you suffer
Superstition ain't the way
Superstition ain't the way
Superstition ain't the way
Superstition ain't the way
Superstition ain't the way

My dreams keep me awake at night
Written in rhymes, 'til I deliver the hype
Am I just living the lie
With this you must know that the number's just sold whoa
Will keep me going through the tough times, dream with me
We forget 90 per cent of it when we wake
But the other 10 per cent it never fades
Dreaming dreams, day to day goals
Stay awake loads, try to make the cut like the
Paper or razor blade, oh, never give up
And just remember just to hold out more
A couple years ago
I couldn't just control that thought
You'd find me buskin' on the street
When it was cold outdoors
And now I'm sweating on the stage of a sold out tour
Writing love songs for the sake of it
Never to make a hit
You can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick
I'm not a rapper I'm a singer, I just take the piss and
Most of these other guys are kids that Pulses
Little sister has to babysit, that's just the way it is
Dreams you own, just set your goals
And have the utmost faith in it; tread your own path
You'll never make it as a follower, you'll never know
Where you will go or where you will be tomorrow rha

Superstition ain't the way
Superstition ain't the way
Superstition ain't the way
Superstition ain't the way
Superstition ain't the way

Superstition, babe
Superstition, babe
Superstition, babe
Superstition, babe
Superstition, babe
Superstition, babe
Superstition, babe
Superstition, babe

Cause ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Cause ain't no sunshine when she's gone
She's always gone too long
Anytime she goes away

I wonder this time where she's gone
Wonder if she's gone to stay
Cause ain't no sunshine when she's gone
She's always gone too long
Anytime she goes away

And I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know

I know, I know, know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, know

Hey, I oughta leave young thing alone
But ain't no sunshine when she's gone

Oh anytime she goes away
Superstition ain't the way
Oh anytime she goes away
Superstition ain't the way
Oh anytime she goes away
Superstition ain't the wayEmbed
5 Postcards LyricsFace me, are you tired of living?
Replace, she was so unforgiving
And I’m so frustrated, so dilated
And she’s telling me I’ve wasted my time
And I’m running back like, just to face the facts right
To tell me your voice takes me through the night

Your smile and your memory
Simply eases me to sleep
In my ear while the whispering
Melts my heart on every beat

Still you’re singing lullabies and postcards to this place
And we’re asking for so much more
Now you’re bringing smiles and laughter to this face
While bad memories are in pieces on the floor

Face me, are you tired of living?
Replace, she was so unforgiving
And I’m so frustrated, so dilated
And she’s telling me I’ve wasted my time
And I’m running back like, just to face the facts right
To tell me your voice takes me through the night

Time past, heal this broken heart
Pulled away that sellotape
Take your time, ‘cos I won’t mind
I doubt if I even know that I’m awake
And still you’re singing lullabies and postcards to this place
And we’re asking for so much more
Now you’re bringing smiles and laughter to this face
While bad memories are in pieces on the floorEmbed
2 Fall Down LyricsIn hotel rooms far away from home
I miss you, more than you will know

Shine a light
Just one side
To think again
That your mine
It's high time
I'm far away from home

Tell me that there's no where left to land
And I'll fall down

Catch me with the strength of your own hands
And I'll fall down

Oh I need you, without you I'll fall apart
And last winter, I need you to feed my heart

But all the night
Sky blue
Stars are bright
Shine through
Like you
And I'm far away from home
Tell me that there's no where left to land
And I'll fall down

Catch me with the strength of your own hands
And I'll fall down

Tell me that there's no where left to land
And I'll fall down

Catch me with the strength of your own hands
And I'll fall down

4 Ours LyricsOne, two, one, two

Good news, in a month we'll know
The due date's the same
And the MRI can wait
The drive there was long
But the drive back relief flooded over us
And we will pay in 

Oh I love you
I will not stop saying that
Moments we can't take back
Forward from this hour, minute, second
What would I do
If you don't guide the way home
I know I should stay strong
If only for now

Living like life is fleeting
In a blink it all could change
So just grab all you can take
Feeling like time is speeding
All I know is that tomorrow
Is not promised, but today
Today is ours
Today is ours
It's assumed, better to be certain
It drives us insane
All the plates that we spin
Perspective's a bitch
Never her game played
But the smallest things
We won't let them in

Oh I love you
I will not stop saying that
Moments we can't take back
Forward from this hour, minute, second
What would I do
If you don't guide the way home
I know I should stay strong
If only for now

Living like life is fleeting
In a blink it all could change
So just grab all you can take
Feeling like time is speeding
All I know is that tomorrow
Is not promised, but today
Today is ours

And I want to see the sun rise and set
Count the stars
Today is ours
What if right now is all that we get
The let's start
Living like life is fleeting
In a blink it all could change
So just grab all you can take
Feeling like time is speeding
All I know is that tomorrow
Is not promised, but today

Living like life is fleeting
In a blink it all could change
So just grab all you can take
Feeling like time is speeding
All I know is that tomorrow
Is not promised, but today
Today is ours
Today is oursEmbed
5 I Never Fell Lyrics
If you wanna put this on me, that’s fine
I never blamed you for anything at all, in my life
Things we try to do won’t work
So can you help me out?
Things we try to do won’t work
So can you help me out?


And say if you love somebody new
So even in my mind it’s true
Cause I have fallen for you
Say if you love somebody new


See I wanna take her to the Get Cape. Wear Cape. Fly Show
I could have taken anyone there
But I like the way she brushed her hair back
I never trust, begin to realize
How fast I would turn an eye
I was blind to all, yeah I saw all




Seeing this fake heart break
And stomach ache has got me
Acting like a pregnancy

I never fell for you, you tripped me
Cause even in my mind, in my mind
I never fell for you, you tripped me
In my mind it's true, in my mind now
I never fell for you, you tripped me
Even in my mind, in my mind
I never fell for you, you tripped me
In my mind now, my mind
I never fell for you, you tripped me2Embed

2 Castle On The Hill (Nevada Remix) Lyrics
When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I


Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home


I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill


Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when


We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill


One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home


And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill2Embed
4 Bad Habits (Acoustic Version) Lyrics
Ooh, ooh


Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful


My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's truе
My bad habits lead to you


Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you

Evеry pure intention ends when the good times start
Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
It started under neon lights and then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far


My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you


Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh


We took the long way 'round
Burned 'til the fun ran out, now

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you


Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

6 2step (Australian Remix) Lyrics
I had a bad week
Spent the evening pretending it wasn't that deep
You could see in my eyes that it was taking over
I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment
You know you take all of my stress right down
Help me get it off my chest and out
Into the ether with the rest of this mess that just keeps us depressed
We forget that we're here right now


'Cause we're livin' life at a different pace, stuck in a constant race
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break, something's gotta change
We should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn
If we're missin' out on what the people think is right
Seein' through a picture behind the screen and forget to be
Lose the conversation for the message that you'll never read
I think maybe you and me
Oh, we should head out to the place where the music plays
And then


We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone, then loved
And all we need is us to go all

Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us


We can stay up till the sunrise, kick it in the late night
Just you and me, don't have to be shy, baby
Don't be shy, baby
It's a time like this, baby
Free my mind with a kiss, I'm in bliss
Yeah, this is Heaven, baby
And I don't wanna miss what we have right now
So tell me, would you stay up? (Stay up)
Late night, talkin' till we make trust (Make trust)
Baby, tell me, would you be the one, be my one? (Be the one)


We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone, then loved
And all we need is us to go all

Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us to go all night
Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us to go all nightEmbed
4 Fall (Live at the Bedford) Lyrics
You and I, two of a mind
This love's one of a kind
You and I, we're drifting
Over the edge


And I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
And if I fall for you
Would you fall too?


You and I learning to speak
With kisses on cheek
You and I we're drifting over the edge


And I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
And if I fall for you
Would you fall too?


And I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
And if I fall for you
Would you fall too?

Would you fall too?
Would you fall too?
Would you fall too?
Would you fall too?1Embed
1 mall Bump - Live From Wembley Stadium Lyrics
Now, Wembley, I've not played this song in a...
Around two years, maybe, maybe longer
But I feel like playing it today
Let's see how it goes


You're just a small bump unborn
In four months you're brought to life
You might be left with my hair
But you'll have your mother's eyes
I'll hold your body in my hands, be as gentle as I can
But for now you're a scan of my unmade plans
A small bump in four months, you're brought to life


And I'll hold you tightly
I'll give you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you


'Cause you are my one and only
And you can wrap your fingers round my thumb
And hold me tight
You are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb
And hold me tight
And you'll be alright

Oh, you're just a small bump unknown, you'll grow into your skin
With a smile like hers and a dimple beneath your chin
Finger nails the size of a half grain of rice
Eyelids closed to be soon opened wide
A small bump, in four months you'll open your eyes


I'll whisper quietly
I'll give you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you


'Cause you are my one and only
And you can wrap your fingers round my thumb
And hold me tight
You are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb
And hold me tight
And you'll be alright


You can lie with me
With your tiny feet
When you're half asleep
I'll leave you be
Right in front of me
For a couple weeks
So I can keep you safe

'Cause you are my one and only
And you can wrap your fingers round my thumb
And hold me tight
You are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb
And hold me tight
And you'll be alright


You were just a small bump unborn
Four months then torn from life
Maybe you were needed up there
But we're still unaware as why2Embed
4 Quiet Ballad of Ed Lyrics
In shadow there lies hope
Cut tension with a knife
I find it hard to cope
Stop playing with my life
You analyse my fears
Analyse my dreams
Choke on burning tears
Through my silent screams


Things aren't what they seem


Tell a hundred craftsmen to work on me
Tell this army of angels to make me breathe
Open doors just to take away the key
I'll let you all see that I'm doing better


Watch me fall
As I stumble at your feet
Always losing in this game
Your lies cut me deep
And you don't even know my name
With your consistency
To always make me crawl
And my durability
Not affected at all

Still, things aren't what they seem


Tell a hundred craftsmen to work on me
Tell this army of angels to make me breathe
Open doors just to take away the key
I'll let you all see that I'm doing better
That I'm doing better


Feel the pain
On my brain
Feel the strain
As I start to decay
Feel the strain
Every passing day
Feel the pain
As I start to decay


And tell a hundred craftsmen to work on me
Tell this army of angels to make me breathe
Open doors just to take away the key
I'll let you all see that I'm doing better
That I'm doing betterEmbed
4 Bonus Track Lyrics
I want to be real
Not some conscience to myself
The way you worship, never ending
Some idol who's pretending to be true
How you put upon yourself
A man who never seems
To answer to you words
So go and make me over


I'm a fly upon your neck
You can't control me
I have my words, my voice
My strengths, my choice
And I can cut as deep
Just as deep as I need


Don't want your advice
'Cause I've made up my own mind
The way you bore me with the stories
Of far and distant times
I've heard it before
So don't try that on me
The way you worship, never-ending
Some idol who's pretending to be true
It could be you
Brainwashed by the lies
It's no surprise
That you'd wanna waste your time

I'm a fly upon your neck
You can't control me
I have my words, my voice
My strengths, my choice
And I can cut as deep
Just as deep as I needEmbed
3 The City (Remix) Lyrics
Hey, look, it's funny how the city where the Queen sleeps still ain't got clean streets
But there ain't a day when she ain't got clean sheets
And homeless people roll with needles
And you've gotta pay tax when you own a vehicle
Tube fare doubles up every two years
And the buses upstairs is a no-go area
The man are like "pass me your mobile, hear me now"
And chew the crunch on the credit
You can't get a roof over your head, you're stuck in the debit
But every single month they come for the debit
Direct action, if you don't play they
Dive in, snatch things and they don't say
Now the crib's vacant, victim of inflation
The black letters turn red cause they've been patient
And that six years' rent has just been wasted, wasted, wasted


London calls me a stranger, a traveller
This is now my home, my home
I’m burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I’m blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
If the city never sleeps then that makes two

And my lungs hurt and my ears bled
With the sound of the city life echoed in my head
Do I need this to keep me alive?
The traffic stops and starts but I need to move along


Hey, look, I'm from a city full of jammed up traffic, night buses
All-night clubbers, Kings Cross to all-night lovers
That knew when to pay rent and stay in their apartment
Talented buskers playing that guitar riff
The church pastor's still praying for answers
Way too much congestion, they're charging
Way too much for petrol, I'm laughing
But there ain't no funny side
It's like winter all year, there ain't no summer time
Stone Island jacket, keep warm
And all phone lines are tapped, you've been warned
And also mind the gap and keep calm
Cause one wrong move on the train, big beard
And it's gunshots, two in your brain, it's weird
So as much as I'm in love with this city
Just maybe I've had enough of the city

4 Pause Lyrics
You know I got to get away
To find some peace and sanity
I've been playing hide-and-seek too long
Shaking, making, everybody waking
Setting the hi-fi bleed
Keeping me back
While you’re spinning my track
That'll knock you off your feet
Monkey see what monkey do
But I'm a monkey telling you
I just think that we should take a break
Tickity-tock the clock with the hip-hop
And Alonestar backing me up, we won’t stop
I gotta be searching for my peace of mind
Now let the track rewind


And play, let the music play
It came, so let the music say what it feels
Shame, shame it took too long
To see that you were wrong
Now turn the song back on


This is Alonestar coming at you with a new style
Kicking dust, ready to bust, it's Urban Angel
Artistic, flipping the script
Who'd you really want to get it with? Ed and Alonestar
We're like live wires sparking, ready to blow
We've already sown our seeds, we're just waiting to grow, blow
We're gonna lift you like a shock to your body
Metaphorical speech when we come and see you ducking for cover
Sheeran Lock coming ready to rock
With Urban Angel and Alonestar and Ed, keep it locked
Let the beat pump, drop the bass but don't stop
We're kicking the sound, let the bass bins pound
We're gonna roll, can you feel me now with my body?
Get down to the sound
It's Ed Sheeran in the place and Alonestar rising up
We gotta rise up, I said rise up

And play, let the music play
It came, so let the music say what it feels
Shame, shame it took too long
To see that you were wrong
Now turn the song back onEmbed
4 Get Over It LyricsStarted off with one kiss
Standing in a red dress
Silhouette the sunset
Ripple in the breeze
Finished with a book and
Saying better off friends
Even though you weren't friends
Before you'd ever meet

Lovers to strangers
Watch how it changes
It's such a shame
To end like this
To end like this
Get over it

I know we failed, at least we tried
Oh I, I know we did
Yeah your words will bruise my pride
Tonight it stings a bit
In a losing state of mind
I cry "Is that all there is?"
And it hurts to say goodbye
But I'll get over it

Shouting from a sentence
But it's not the way you meant it
Should have given more attention
In to the little red lights
I no longer know you
I used to love the old you
But I guess I should have told you
Way before tonight
Lovers to strangers
Watch how it changes
It's such a shame
To end like this
To end like this
Get over it

I know we failed, at least we tried
Oh I, I know we did
Yeah your words will bruise my pride
Tonight it stings a bit
In a losing state of mind
I cry "Is that all there is?"
And it hurts to say goodbye
But I'll get over it

One day there will be someone else
In your life
And I know my love it can't be helped
Tonight
I knew you better than I know myself
But it's time
Yeah, it's time
To get over it

I know we failed, at least we tried
Oh I, I know we did
Yeah your words will bruise my pride
Tonight it stings a bit
In a losing state of mind
I cry "Is that all there is?"
And it hurts to say goodbye
But I'll get over itEmbed
2 Sunburn - deluxe edition LyricsYou're not her
Though I try to see you differently
I tow the line
You see, I'm searching for what used to be mine

I saw your eyes
And then I saw her staring back at me
And I will try to find another one
Who suited me as well as her

I've moved far away from you
And I want to see you here beside me, dear
But things aren't clear

When we never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I'd miss you
I miss you

She was mine
I was hers
And all that's in between
If she would cry
I would shelter her
And keep her from the darkness that will be
If I moved far away from you
And I want to see you here beside me, dear
But things aren't clear,oh

We never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I'd miss you
And I miss you

Don't drop me in
It's not my turn
If you cut deep
Then I might learn
If you scar and leave me
Like a sunburn

Don't drop me in
It's not my turn
If you cut deep
Then I might learn
You scarred and left me
Like a sunburn
We never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I'd miss you
I miss youEmbed
1 aturday LyricsOn Saturday I know that you're coming up to see me
When I go away things will change
And you'll never know it was easy
It won't help pretending that we'll stay close
I can't help thinking that
I try to pretend that it's your loss
And I never know, oh I'll never know if it will work
There's no better time
She's still thinking I'm too far away
Understanding why she's not thinking I'm a fool to wait
And I left her today
And I left her today
Come Sunday I'll see that one day you'll rescue me
And when I leave again I'll feel strange
And I'll never know, oh I'll never know if you're in love again
I can't stop being a fool for you
I won't help thinking that
Still I am falling for her and she did too
Oh I'll never know, oh I'll never know if I'm in love
There's no better time
She's still thinking I'm too far away
Understanding why she's not thinking I'm a fool to wait
But I left her today
There's no better time
She's still thinking I'm too far away
Understanding why she's not thinking I'm a fool to wait
But I left her todayEmbed
1 ContributorHold On Lyrics
It's alright to cry
Even my dad does sometimes
So don't wipe your eyes
Tears remind you you're alive
It's alright to die
'Cause death's the only thing you haven't tried
But just for tonight
Hold on


So live life like you're giving up
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart


It's alright to shake
Even my hand does sometimes
So inside we'll rage
Against the dying of the light
It's alright to say
That that's the only thing you haven't tried
But just for today
Hold on

So live life like you're giving up
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart
Hold onEmbed
2 Shape of You (NOTD Remix) Lyrics
The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like


Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead


I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your, love with your body
In love with your body, body, body
In love with your body, body, body
In love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with shape of you

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like


Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead


I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your, love with your body
In love with your body, body, body
In love with your body, body, body
In love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with shape of you

Body
In love with your body, body, body
In love with your body
In love with your body, body, bodyEmbed
5 TranslationsPortuguês2step (Brazilian Remix) Lyrics
I had a bad week
Spent the evening pretending it wasn't that deep
You could see in my eyes that it was taking over
I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment
You know you take all of my stress right down
Help me get it off my chest and out
Into the ether with the rest of this mess that just keeps us depressed
We forget that we're here right now


'Cause we're livin' life at a different pace, stuck in a constant race
Keep the prеssure on, you're bound to break, somеthing's gotta change
We should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn
If we're missin' out on what the people think is right
Seein' through a picture behind the screen and forget to be
Lose the conversation for the message that you'll never read
I think maybe you and me
Oh, we should head out to the place where the music plays
And then


We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone, then loved
And all we need is us to go all

Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us (Chefin)


Uma Lamborghini preta, você vem?
Ou quer andar na minha Mercedes-Benz?
Eu sou tão novo enriquecendo os bem
Olha o relógio, tem o Rolex, te dei
Pisando fofo, tenho um Jordan que é tão raro
E tu olha pra quem? (Chefin)
Eu fui de cara no teu colo
E tu me fez refém (Prr, prr; ahn, ahn, ahn, ahn)
Agora olha a madrugada, vem
Não é a mesma longe de você
Olhando o tempo, eu pude perceber
Que algumas coisa' tem que se esquecer
'Tava bolando umas coisa', pensando em um futuro
Mandei mensagem p'ra saber de tudo (Ahn, ahn)
Só que no fundo, isso dava um duro (Oh)
Pra poder explicar tudo (Ah)
Que você tinha através da passagem (Oh, oh)
Pedindo um trocado pra ficar na party (Ah)
Vou continuar (Ah, ah, pow, pow, pow, pow)

We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love (Prr)
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified (Ahn, ahn)
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night (Ahn, ahn, ahn, ahn, ahn, ahn-ahn)
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time (Yeah, ayy)
But we know what it feels to be low then up (Oh, oh), alone, then loved
And all we need is us to go all (Ayy)


Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us to go all night (Two-step)
Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love (Two-step)

4 The Sea Lyrics
Pass me a drink
You say it's gonna take a while
Your consciousness sinks
Tears from a crocodile


You're wasting your time
Giving me the speech
You try to, don't reach
Your smile
You're holding your tears
Your inside is dead
You're eating your fears
In a cigarette
You've waited too long
To finally see
The sunshine in the rain
Is as deep as the sea


I've taken the blow
It's all down on paper
Had fun in the snow
But no "see you later’"

You're wasting your time
Giving me the speech
You try to, don't reach
Your smile
You're holding your tears
Your inside is dead
You're eating your fears
In a cigarette
You've waited too long
To finally see
The sunshine in the rain
Is as deep as the seaEmbed

I love you dearly through here and there
What can I do to make you share?
What can I do to make you care?

5 Shivers (Acoustic Version) Lyrics
I took an arrow to the heart
I never kissed a mouth that tastes like yours
Strawberries and a somethin' more
Ooh, yeah, I want it all
Lipstick on my guitar (Ooh)
Fill up the engine, we can drive real far
Go dancin' underneath the stars
Ooh, yeah, I want it all
Mmm, you got me feelin' like


I wanna be that guy, I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile, I wanna feel like I'm
Like my soul's on fire, I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah, you got me singin' like


Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give me thе shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And whеn they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back
And we'll say, "Ooh, I love it when you do it like that"
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back

Into the car
On the back seat in the moonlit dark
Wrap me up between your legs and arms
Ooh, I can't get enough
You know you could tear me apart (Ooh)
Put me back together and take my heart
I never thought that I could love this hard
Ooh, I can't get enough
Mmm, you got me feelin' like


I wanna be that guy, I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile, I wanna feel like I'm
Like my soul's on fire, I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah, you got me singin' like


Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks

Baby, you burn so hot, you make me shiver
With the fire you got, this thing we started

You know you make me shiver, -er, -er
Baby, you burn so hot, you make me shiver
With the fire you got, this thing we started
I don't want it to stop

5 Billy Ruskin Lyrics
Mr. Ruskin, come and paint my picture
We're losing sleep 'cos we steal the week
Now who's your best friend? Can you introduce me?
See, I can't seem to even let you breathe


When I dance with Billy Ruskin in my mind's eye
Please let me forget that I'm standing on my own
And I am my own best friend and I need me to see
That I am more than what is hiding in me


Come and show me if you can
See I know you're me, but I can't seem to understand
If you know me, place my hand on mine
And we will resurrect the time
That we lost when you left my mind
It's psycho-paranoia disappearing in time
Come and show me what makes you tick
I need you to get out of my mind quick


When I dance with Billy Ruskin in my mind's eye
Please let me forget that I'm standing on my own
And I am my own best friend and I need me to see
That I am more than what is hiding in meEmbed
4 Oh No LyricsThink it's written on a notebook somewhere
Can you feel it as you breathe the night air, yeah
I can't remember what you said to me
But I know it was hard, hard, hard for you to speak

Time drift as you speed into love
Heart race as you heat up my blood, yeaaah
Let's just continue what we used to do
Cause I know it was hard, hard, hard to see the truth

And it's late, it's late

I can't let go, oh no
I miss you, oh no
I can't let go, oh no
I miss you, oh no

Ooooh, oh no
Ooooh, oh no
Ooooh, oh no
Ooooh, oh no

Drift off into space without care
Can you see it as you sit back in prayer, yeah
Lights dim and flicker blacker than the room
Cause I know it was hard, hard, hard to see the truth
Sleep tight and I will not wake you up
Kiss me and I want to be in love, heeey
Lights dim and flicker blacker than the room
Cause I know it was hard, hard, hard to see the truth

And it's late, it's late, no

I can't let go, oh no
I miss you, oh no
I can't let go, oh no
I miss you, oh no

I can't let go
I miss you
I can't let go
I miss you

4 I Can’t Spell LyricsI found the words to say how I feel
But I just can’t spell them
I lost the nerve in a Suffolk field
So you can tell them
That I’m a different man with a different tune
I didn’t find love until last June
But I lost it, just like I lost it all
I tried to use it to break my fall
‘Cos I need something, anything to replace you
Or something closeEmbed
3 Dirrty (Cover) LyricsRing the alarm, and I'm trowin' elbows
Ring the alarm, and I'm trowin' elbows
Ring the alarm, and I'm trowin' elbows
Ring the alarm...

Oooh, I'm overdue
Give me some room, coming through
Paid my dues, I'm in the mood
Me and my girls gonna shake the room

DJ spinning, show your hands
Let's get dirrty, that's my jam
I need that, uh to get me off
Sweating until my clothes come off

It's explosive, speakers are thumping
Still jumping, 6 in the morning
Table dancing, glasses are crashing
No question, time for some action
Temperature's up (Can you feel it), 'bout to erupt
Gonna get my girls, get your boys, gonna make some noise

Gonna get rowdy
Gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Wanna get dirrty
It's about time that I came to start the party
Sweat dripping over my body
Dancing, getting just a little naughty
Wanna get dirrty, it's about time for my arrival
Ring the alarm, and I'm trowin' elbows
Ring the alarm, and I'm trowin' elbows
Ring the alarm, and I'm trowin' elbows
Ring the alarm...

Ah, heat is up
Ladies, fellas drop your cups
Bodies packed, front to back
Move your arse; I like that

Tight hip huggers (low for show)
Shake a little something (on the floor)
I need that (uh) to get me off
Sweating until my clothes come off

Let's get open, cause a commotion
Still going, 8 in the morning
There's no stopping, we keep it popping
Hard rocking, everyone's talking

Give all you got (give it to me)
Just hit the spot
Gonna get my girls, get your boys, gonna make some noise

Gonna get rowdy
Gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Wanna get dirrty
It's about time that I came to start the party
Sweat dripping over my body
Dancing, getting just a little naughty
Wanna get dirrty, it's about time for my arrival
It's the one you been wait'n on
Get up get it rough, yup that's what's up
Giving just what you love to the maximum
Uh-oh (Uh-oh) Here we go (here we go)
What to do when the music starts to drop
That's when we take it to the parking lot
And I bet you somebody's gonna call the cops
Uh-oh (Uh-oh) Here we go (Here we go)
Oooh Oooh Oooh Oooh Oooooh

Yo, hot damn, Doc a Jam like a Summer Show
I keep my car looking like a crash dummy drove
My gear look like the bank got my money froze
For dead presidents I pimp like Huddy roll
Doc the one that excite ya divas (ow!)
If the media shine, I'm shining with both of the sleeves up
Yo Christina (what), better hop in here
My block live and in color, like Rodman hair (han)
The club is packed, the bar is filled
I'm waiting for sister to act like Lauryn Hill
Frankly, it's a rap, no bargain deals
I drive a four wheel ride with foreign wheels
Throw it up baby it's Brick City, I heard of that
We blessed, and hung low, like Bernie Mac (Bernie Mac)
Dogs, let 'em out, women, let 'em in
It's like I'm ODB, the way I'm gonna get
Rowdy
Gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Wanna get dirrty
It's about time that I came to start the party
Sweat dripping over my body
Dancing, getting just a little naughty
Wanna get dirrty, it's about time for my arrival
Rowdy
Gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Wanna get dirrty
It's about time that I came to start the party
Sweat dripping over my body
Dancing, getting just a little naughty
Wanna get dirrty, it's about time for my arrival

5 I See Fire (Kygo Remix) LyricsIf this is to end in fire
Then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out father, oh, stand by and we will

Watch the flames burn auburn on
The mountain side
And if we should die tonight
Then we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time

Calling out father, oh
Prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn over
The mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky

Now I see fire
Inside the mountain
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fireEmbed

You know you make me shiver
Yeah, you got me singin' likeEmbed
5 America Lyrics
Chicago on a Friday night
I was walking from a bar with a friend of mine
We heard sirens and saw blue lights
Right in front of us
Seems her man took another mans life
I can search a wrong and never make a right
What's worst by the end of the night?
There'll be somethin' else, somewhere else
As the sun sets over the hills
In Los Angeles and New York
Somebody's tryna find a place to sleep
But daddy's lookin for daughter down in New Orleans tonight


Hey man, just one more night in America
Hey man, just one more night in America


Miami on a Saturday night
Drinks are flowing all around and the pad is wide
Hope is low but the heels are high
Yeah, this town's alive, oh, na-na
She only wanted to feel some love
Didn't get much when she was growin' up
Men tried but they were never enough
She needs somethin' else or somewhere else
And in Vegas, someone's gamblin'
A family dream are two roads down
Her mother lives in poverty, hopin' her soldiers on a call
And say, "Mama, I'm fine."

Hey man, just one more night in America
Hey man, just one more night in America


Every time I'm here, everywhere I go
I can see the beauty, I can feel the hope
Oh, and some folks try, some folks cry
Some folks die for the stars and stripes


Hey man, just one more night in America (Just one more night)
Hey man, just one more night in America (Just one more night)
Hey man (Hey man), it's one more night in America
(Just one more night, oh, na-na)
Hey man (Hey man), it's one more night in America
(Just one more night)
(Hey man, just one more night in America)Embed
4 Give Me Love (New Machine Remix) Lyrics
And that I'll fight my corner
Maybe tonight I'll call ya
After my blood turns into alcohol
No, I just wanna hold ya

Give a little time to me (give a little time to me)
We'll play hide and seek (we'll play hide and seek)
All I want is the taste that your lips allow
My, my, my, my, give me love
Give me love

My my, my my
Give me love
My my, my my
Give me love
All I want is the taste that your lips allow
My, my, my, my, give me love

Love me, love me, love me
Give me love, give me love


As youths we used to play games
Like hide and seek and Simon Says
And then we realized we’re not mice, we’re men
And that was kinda dead
For one more time, let’s play Simon Says
But this time, it’s not Simon, ‘cause Simon’s Ed
Give me love like it meant life or death
Like it meant your final breath, yeah
Give me love like you could buy it from the corner shop
You could spend your time, so it don’t matter if you’re poor or not
Give me that real love, something you could feel, love
Maybe it could heal ya, just like the first time you said it
Give me love cause hate is the worst kind of weapon
It’s like I finally see the person in my reflection
Check



Give me love like there was love to give
And if it does exist, well
Yeah give me love like there was love to give
I be wondering if love exists and if it does then give me some yo give me love
Give me love, say give me love, give me love, yeah


Oh, I just wanna hold ya
(Give me love like there was love to give
And if it does exist, well)
Give me love
Love me, love me, love me
Give me love, give me loveEmbed
2 Thinking Out Loud (Alex Adair Remix) Lyrics
When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darling I will be loving you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three


When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same
Cause honey your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory


Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars, oh darling
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are


I'm thinking out loud


We found love right where we are
We found love right where we areEmbed
1 ContributorAg Smaoineamh Os Ard Lyrics
Nuair is léir nach seasann do chosa níos mó
Is nach leanann do shúil mar a bhíodh
An mbeidh teacht ar do bhéalín ar bhlaiseadh mo ghrá?
An mbeidh d’aghaidh ag fógairt d’aoibh?


A stórín, beidh mé ag fanacht leat féin go seachtó naoi
A leana, is tú an duine dom fiú ag fiche trí
Tá mé ag rá leat go dtiteann daoine i ngrá gan aon chúis ná haon bhrí
B’fhéidir gan ach buille ar lámh
Titim féin i ngrá leat arís is arís
Tá rud ar intinn agam le rá


Bí liom ann Féadfaidh tú mé a thógáil anocht
Ó luí liomsa faoin solas ón oíche gheal
Éist le buillí mo chroí ar m’ucht
Ag smaoineamh os ard
A leana, fuair muid neamh anseo ar domhan


Nuair atá mé níos sine is ag briseadh go mall
Dearmad déanta ar m'ainm arís
Gan mo lámha in ann don mhéid céanna
Ó is tú a bheidh fós i mo chroí

Beidh tú liomsa, is mise leastsa go deo mo chroí
Tú le feiceáil gach oíche i mo bhrionglóidí


Tá mé ag rá leat go dtiteann daoine i ngrá gan aon chúis ná haon bhrí
B’fhéidir go mba chuid é don phlean
Mise agus tusa le chéile go deo
Ag glacadh go mbeidh tuilleadh ar lean


Bí liom ann
Féadfaidh tú mé a thógáil anocht
Ó luí liomsa faoin solas ón oíche gheal
Éist le buillí mo chroí ar m'ucht
Ag smaoineamh os ard
A leana, fuair muid neamh anseo ar domhan
A leana, fuair muid neamh anseo ar domhan
A leana, fuair muid neamh anseo ar domhanEmbed
2 Beautiful People (NOTD Remix) Lyrics
We are, we are, we are


L.A. on a Saturday night in the summer
Sundown and they all come out
Lamborghinis and their rented Hummers
The party's on, so they're headin' downtown
Everybody's lookin' for a come up
And they wanna know what you're about
Me in the middle with the one I love and
We're just tryna figure everything out


We don't fit in well 'cause we are just ourselves
I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
This is my only fear: that we become


Beautiful people
Beautiful people


L.A., mmm, drove for hours last night and we made it nowhere (Nowhere, nowhere)
I see stars in your eyes when we're halfway there (All night)
I'm not fazed by all them lights and flashin' cameras
'Cause with my arms around you, there's no need to care

We don't fit in well, we are just ourselves
I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
This is my only fear: that we become


Beautiful people
Beautiful people

Ed & (Khliad)
We are, we are, we are
(Beautiful)


Beautiful people
Drop top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
"What d'you do?" and "Who d'you know?"
Inside the world of beautiful people
Champagne and rolled-up notes
Prenups and broken homes
Surrounded, but still alone
Let's leave the party


Beautiful peopleEmbed
3 Bad Habits (Kooldrink Amapiano Remix) Lyrics
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
(One, two, three)


Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful


My bad habits lead to late night—late night—late—
Conversations with a stranger—stranger—stranger—
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it—last, but—last, but it—
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
It's true, my bad habits lead to you
It's true, my bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't еscape
Nothin' happens after two, it's truе, it's true
My bad habits lead to you


Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you

Every pure intention ends when the good times start
Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
It started under neon lights and then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far


My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to late night—late night—late—
Conversations with a stranger—stranger—stranger—
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it—last, but—last, but it—
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
It's true, my bad habits lead to you


Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh


We took the long way 'round
And burned 'til the fun ran out, now

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to you
It's true, my bad habits lead to youEmbed
4 Homeless (Live at the Bedford) Lyrics
Could I wake up next to you
When we're hitting double figures
Look into your eyes
Like I'm looking into double mirrors
Could you make it any clearer
Everything's such a blur
It's not my turn
It's hers to get hurt
On a late night
Coming home from way too many train rides
Lace not as red as my face
I'm home at the same time
Highbury estate's fine
Smoking like a dragon, but don't chase lines


I haven't slept for the past week
Two hours ain't enough for me
I feel inspired, at quarter to three am
I haven't changed since our last meet
I'm still getting all my meals for free
Think I'm being shunned by my feet again


It's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be

And now I'm sitting on a night bus
Flicking through my Ipod
Feeling kinda tired
So I try to close my eyes up
Driver, turn the lights off
Lights on, on stage, mics on
Song plays, nice one
Gotta keep my hype strong
Truth be, never went to Uni
People see right through me
But I'm not a fool, see
I'm never gonna do one
Gonna live past 22, done
Everything I need to
Except get a 2:1


I haven't slept for the past week
Two hours ain't enough for me
I feel inspired, at quarter to three am
I haven't changed since our last meet
I'm still getting all my food for free
Think I'm being shunned by my feet again


It's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be

When I feel cold
You keep me warm
And I'm not looking for some loose change
Just wanna find a true mate
Who wants to be my duvet?


So this is the part where everyone gets a bit involved and uh... I introduce myself. My name is Ed Sheeran and it's a pleasure to be here. Who's up for singing a bit, yeah? The lyrics are "It's not a homeless life for me / It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be" That's a little bit of a sing-song right now


It's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be

Thank you!Embed
2 Sing - Live and in Session Lyrics
It's late in the evening
Glass on the side
I've been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignorin' everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
And I don't wanna know
If you're gettin' ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no-man's land
And for the longest time, lady


I need you darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin'
Won’t you let me know
If you love me
Come on, get involved
Feel it rushin' through you
From your head to toe


SING!
LOUDER!
SING!

This love is ablaze, I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then, we got nothin' to say and nothin' to know
But somethin' to drink and maybe somethin' to smoke
Let it go until our roads are changed
Singin' "We Found Love" in a local rave
No, I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out, then hope and pray
I told her my name, then said "It's nice to meet you"
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know if she's a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness, I'm in
Deep shit if anybody finds out
I meant to drive home but I drunk all of it now
Not soberin' up, we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another, now she's kissin' my mouth


I need you darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin'
Won’t you let me know
If you love me
Come on, get involved
Feel it rushin' through you
From your head to toe

SING!
LOUDER!
SING!


Can you feel it?
All the guys in here don't even wanna dance
Can you feel it?
All that I can hear is music from the back
But can you feel it?
Found you hidin' here so won't you take my hand, darlin'?
Before the beat kicks in again
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?


SING!
I need you darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin'
Won’t you let me know
LOUDER!
SING!
If you love me
Come on, get involved
Feel it rushin' through you
From your head to toe
LOUDER!

1 ContributorBest Part of Me (Live At Abbey Road) Lyrics
My lungs are black, my heart is pure
My hands are scarred from nights before
And my hair is thin and falling out of all the wrong places
I am a little insecure
My eyes are crossed, but they're still blue
I bite my nails and tell the truth
I go from thin to overweight day to day it fluctuates
My skin is inked, but faded, too


But she loves me, she loves me
Why the hell she love me
When she could have anyone else?
Oh, you love me, you love me
Why the hell do you love me?
'Cause I don't even love myself


Baby, the best part of me is you
And lately, everything's making sense, too
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you


I overthink and still forgive
I lose my phone and place my bets
And I never catch the train on time
Always 30 minutes behind
Your worries ain't seen nothin' yet

But you love me, you love me
Why the hell you love me so
When you could have anyone else?
Yeah, yeah, he loves me, he loves me
And I bet he never lets me go
And shows me how to love myself


'Cause, baby, the best part of me is you
Oh, lately, everything's making sense, too
Baby, I'm so in love with you


With you
Da-dum, da-dum, da-dum, da-dum


Baby, the best part of me is you
Lately, everything's making sense, too
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you
Baby, I'm so in love with you
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with youEmbed
4 No Luck Lyrics
I'm screaming out upon my face
Followed footsteps catch my pace
Broken windows fall in place
Now shattered lovers find their place
We'd flirt
And you'd treat me like dirt
All the pain and the hurt
Just to make matters worse


And I see you all over him
Irresistible sin
When can we be the same again?
What can I do to be making you see?
To come out clean?
You're better off with me


We're stuck
Taking time and wasting mine
No luck
Running around and crashing down
In you I trust nevermore
Leaving you in sand and glass

All I ever felt for you
Went up in a cloud of smoke
How I could I be such a fool
To ever think that we were close?


And I see you all over him
Irresistible sin
When can we be the same again?
What can I do to be making you see?
To come out clean?
You're better off with me


We're stuck
Taking time and wasting mine
No luck
Running around and crashing down
In you I trust nevermore
Leaving you in sand and glassEmbed
4 Two Blokes and a Double Bass LyricsSing the song Celestial Man
Shake the thing your mother gave ya!
Tear your lungs out, scream your heart
Be on your worst behaviour
I’d wager that you’re gonna take it
Make you fight nature, born and raised in
Funk those things that make you go bump in the night
Turn off the dark, put on the light
And he said ‘You and your big cheeks have got me’
Along with ‘Disarm’ and ‘Flooded Quarry’
Turn off the base with the beat-box detox
Pull off the pace, while you sing with no socks
Lampshades, carpets, the stage black
You make the room’s hands laugh as they clap
You make my mouth water with support acts
They could even match you in talent - ignore that!
Gary Dunne and Newton Faulkner ain’t wrong
He’s got me singing to ‘Amerikan Folk Song’
Loop pedal class is used as weaponry
You gotta know your enemy
Gotta check your distance
Don’t talk, only whisper
Slap the base so hard you get blisters
Chikka boom, boom, chikka boom
JP beat-box, feet as flip-flops
Doing the hip hop, mixed with the warm sock
And Stephanie propped up, up by the mic stand
This ain’t no fake, it’s music in your hand
As you run into the centre of the crowd
Silence falls like water
You just wanna shout ‘Wow!’
How did they even have the guts to do it ?
If your name’s Nizlopi, then there ain’t much to it
‘Cos you and your big cheeks have got me spinning around nowEmbed
3 Out Of Love Lyrics
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
Now


And it's dark in a cold December
But I've got you to keep me warm
If you're broken I'll mend you
And keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now


I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
Now


I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now1Embed
7 Firefly (Bravado Dubstep Remix) Lyrics
I fell in love next to you
Burning fires in this room
It just fits, light and smooth
Like my feet in my shoes
Little one, lie with me
Sew you heart to my sleeve
We'll stay quiet underneath
Shooting stars if it helps you sleep


And hold me tight, don't let me breathe
Feeling like you won't believe


There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I don't feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyesEmbed
2 Perfect (Robin Schulz Remix) Lyrics
I found a love for me
Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine


Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight


Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song


I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight


You look perfect tonightEmbed
2 I See Fire - Live and in Session Lyrics
Oh misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons


If this is to end in fire, then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out father oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side


And if we should die tonight, we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Calling out father oh, prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky


Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
And I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

Oh, should my people fall then surely I'll do the same
Confined in mountain halls, we got too close to the flame
Calling out father oh, hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky


Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
And I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me


And if the night is burning, I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns then my brothers will die
And as the sky's falling down it crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground I hear my people screaming out


Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
I see fire (oh you know I saw a city burning out)
I see fire (feel the heat upon my skin)
I see fire
And I see fire burn auburn on the mountainsideEmbed
1 ContributorLately - devlin LyricsI seem to find myself talking to the powers that be
Awaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees
Admiring the seen, inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe
Jet lagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep
Although my blood shot whites and iris's they never find any
Clock stops at times where the sun shine can blind many
Although my eyes are heavy they won't be closing soon
Cos i know that time waits for nobody, I suppose its true
We make corrosive tunes with acid tabs and vocal booths
To see the flashing lights at photo shoots, we make our motive moves

I say what ever I feel to vent a rhyme
So i can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine
Cos we all recognise, real is what my father says
And i'll be sticking to this phrase until I pass away
Overworking, no sleep is just another way to die slow
But i'll just keep going strong as ever, never let my eyes close

DEVLIN
5 o'clock with lights off
Interview with a vampire
Sleep is for the living and not a utensil that I require
I swear i said, that i'll sleep when im dead
Whos on the beat upon the feature with Ed its D-E-V to the Z
Over tired, pale faced like Michael Myers
Bags underneath my eyes can show the baggage i've acquired
And over the time within this maze i'll think you'll find you'll never find that peace of mind you seek to find until your dying
Cuz i got too much to stay awake for, to sleep or even take 4, seconds out the game
Its time to wage war
Scissors, grab a sword, and sharpen up your hunting knives
2 psychopathic lyricists are driving on the hunt tonight
I'm haling from the Essex and the East London boarder line
Villans never sleep they mastermind in all sorts of crimes
Be wide awake just like your snorting lines
Or get left mortified like you just seen the ghost of Jesus walking by
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free, it could be, ahhh
The times i'm living in i never sleep, when trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free, it could be

The times i'm living in lately

I brush my teeth every night but still I wake up with a bad mouth
And the background is my past and my presence will bring it back out
Deliver the raps how I flow
I live with the raps now and those that hate me call me wrong
But they won't slither in too easy, believe me im snake minded
Be within this great time, be on minimum wage, life is a prison escape that im in
Its all to do with timing not the label that you sign with
Then my mates are doing fine but then they never put the time in
I try to hide my cold side like when i flip my pillows
Some of the the songs i write are real because the chart is filled with si-li-cone
Im still broke without the money for a mac pro, living out of three bags no talk about my cash flow
Opposite of sober cos I never did my homework
Which has got me on the sofa, no degree but growing older
I played a fool to catch the wise i will never tell a lie
I wake dead, take deep breaths, try to never die!
Never die

DEVLIN
2 guys with the same view, keep it tight like scrooge
Making metaphors flow and move, like typhoons and tunes
And if we got our eyes on you, we'll catch you while you snooze
Times elapsing while your catching Z's, the masses like to move
We scan the situation, analyse information, and then decide what probably is most practical to do
Driven young gentlemen
I've hardly changed my bed sheets at all over the last 12 months cos i haven't slept in them, true!
Im coming home, the lights are on, your rights are wrong so im correcting 'em
We got the fans all like 'oh wow its its Devs and Ed' what less did you bloody expect from 'em
In the end sleep deprivation might just be our detriment
Fighting through writers block from 9 o'clock to 5 o'clock and no way will I ever waste a second of the time I got
I keep my pupils engaged
Like a classroom in holy matrimony but im only trying to stay awake
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free, it could be, ahhh
The times i'm living in i never sleep, when trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free, it could be. x4
The times i'm living in latelyEmbed
2 Skinny Love (Cover) Lyrics
Come on, skinny love, just last the year
Pour a little salt, we were never here
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer
I tell my love to wreck it all
Cut out all the ropes and let me fall
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Right in the moment this order's tall


And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind
And in the morning I'll be with you
But it will be a different kind
And I'll be holding all the tickets
And you'll be owning all the fines


Come on skinny love, what happened here?
Suckle on the hope in light brassieres
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Sullen load is full, so slow on the split

And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind
And now all your love is wasted
And then who the hell was I?
And I'm breaking at the britches
And at the end of all your lines


Who will love you?
Who will fight?
Who will fall far behind?Embed
1 ummer Nights/No Love For The Lonely (Ed Demo) Lyrics
No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely
No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely


Another night, another club
Another room, a new one
When morning comes, I'm running off
I found lust, but I wanna find love
And every time I get close, I run wild and explode
But I'm lonely, in LA


No lie, yeah, my mama never raised me to be a bad boy
To chase women and to only break hearts, that's fine
When you're eighteen but when you're older
To find love, yeah, you gotta grow up sometimes
Being solo is the way to go, but I've been doing it too long
But you never know though
That one night stand, could just be the one, yeah


Summer nights, and no love for the lonely
Don't come near me, 'cause I'll only break your heart
I will try to find someone to hold me
My love is a flickering candle
In the dark

Another night, another day
Another city, another plane
Another heart I'm gonna break
Another mili on the cardiae
A young girl my heart broke, so I don't wanna get close
I don't know why you're not enough


No lie, yeah, my mama never raised me to be a bad boy
But I ended up being one anyway
Man you can never change me
This is my world, I run this city and I'm in my own lane
Sometimes being solo is the way to
'Cause I love the way I get some
But you never know though cause maybe you
Could just be the one, ayy


Summer nights, and no love for the lonely
Don't come near me, 'cause I'll only break your heart
I will try to find someone to hold me
My love is a flickering candle, in the dark


No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely
No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely
No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely
No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely

Summer nights, and no love for the lonely
Don't come near me, cause I'll only break your heart
I will try to find someone to hold me
My love is a flickering candle, in the dark


No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely
No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely


I will try to find someone to hold me
My love is a flickering candle, in the darkEmbed
1 ContributorGalway Girl (Decoy! Remix) Lyrics
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"


I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance


You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my

You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
Acapella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me


You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, myEmbed
2 South of the Border (Sam Feldt Remix) Lyrics
Come south of the border with me, border with me
Come south of the border with me


She got the mmm, brown eyes, caramel thighs
Long hair, no wedding ring, hey
I saw you lookin' from across the way
And now I really wanna know your name
She got the mmm, white dress, but when she's wearin' less
Man, you know that she drives me crazy
The mmm, brown eyes, beautiful smile
You know I love watching you do your thing


I love her hips, curves, lips say the words
"Te amo, mami, ah, te amo, mami"
I kiss her, this love is like a dream


So join me in this bed that I'm in
Push up on me and sweat, darling
So I'm gonna put my time in
I won't stop until the angels sing
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me (Border with me)

Be free
Come south of the border with me, border with me
Be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that...

He got that mmm, green eyes, givin' me signs
That he really wants to know my name—hey
I saw you lookin' from across the way
And suddenly, I'm glad I came, ay
Ven para acá, quiero bailar, toma mi mano
Quiero sentir tu cuerpo en mí, estás temblando
Mmm, green eyes, takin' your time
Now we know we'll never be the same


I love his lips 'cause he says the words
"Te amo, mami, ah, te amo, mami"
Don't wake up, this love is like a dream

So join me in this bed that I'm in
Push up on me and sweat, darling
So I'm gonna put my time in (Time in)
And won't stop until the angels sing

Flawless diamonds
In a green field near Buenos Aires
Until the sun's rising
We won't stop until the angels sing
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me

Be free
Come south of the border with me, border with me

Come south of the border with me
Jump in that...

Come south of the border with me, border with me
Be free
Come south of the border with meEmbed
2 Castle On The Hill (Acoustic) Lyrics
When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
Tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I


Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home


I'm on my way, driving at 90
Down those country lanes, singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
And we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill


Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when


We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh, how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way, driving at 90
Down those country lanes, singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
And we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill


One friend left to sell clothes
And one works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home


And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hillEmbed
4 Undone Lyrics
I'm made of clay, you shoot me down
I'll ricochet to the ground
Your words of paint, they draw me out
And fill me in with your mouth
And hold your tongue
And I know it's over before it's begun
I lost my way, so help me out
And lend your hand 'til I am found
My voice is mute, not to be heard
So it's up to you for you to bring those words


I
And I
Have come undone
For the last time


This grief you give, it takes its toll
And it dries my heart and drowns my soul
I am a tree, whose branch you broke
The brittle wood has turned to stones, oh


I
And I
Have come undone
For the last time
For the last time
For the last time

Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah


I
And I
Have come undone
For the last time (Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)
For the last time (Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)
For the last time (Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)1Embed
4 Bad Habits (Joel Corry Remix) Lyrics
Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control


My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, it's true
My bad habits lead to you


Habits lead to-
My bad habits lead to you


Every pure intention ends when the good times start
Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
It started out in neon lights and then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far


My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, it's true
My bad habits lead to you

Habits lead to-
My bad habits lead to you
Habits lead to-


We took the long way 'round
Burned 'til the fun ran out, now


My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to you


Habits lead to-


My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, it's true
My bad habits lead to youEmbed
5 Back At Home Lyrics
Saturday, me and my girlfriend are at a party in the West End
And I don't really know nobody here either
Maybe we should've stayed home
And turned down the lights so low
Open up a  Bordeaux, mmm
And put on a jam so slow, so slow


She said, "All the girls here are beautiful"
But baby, no one around comes close to you
And that's the honest truth
Why are we even here?
'Cause all the boys got their eyes on you
For the same reason that my eyes are too
And that's when she made her move
And whispered in my ear and said


Hey, let's leave this party (Hey-ey-ey-ey)
Back to my apartment (Hey-ey-ey-ey)
There's no one here that I know
So take my hand, I want to go
And get this party started back at home


I'm still here with my best friend and I'm not
Disappointed that the party
We just can't fit in with the West End crowd
Can't even hear their conversations, so
Baby, let's hit the road and open up a  Margot, mmm
And put on a jam so slow, so slow

She said, "All the girls here are beautiful"
But baby, no one around comes close to you
And that's the honest truth
Why are we even here?
'Cause all the boys got their eyes on you
For the same reason that my eyes are too
And that's when she made her move
And whispered in my ear and said


Hey, let's leave this party (Hey-ey-ey-ey)
Back to my apartment (Hey-ey-ey-ey)
There's no one here that I know
So take my hand, I want to go
And get this party started back at home


Come on and get it started, yeah
Come on and get it started, no love (Mmm)
Come on and get it started, yeah
Come on and get it started, mmm


Turned down the lights so low
And put on a jam so slow, so slow
'Cause all the people are beautiful
But baby, no one around comes close to you
And that's the honest truth
Whisper in my ear, hey

Hey, let's leave this party (Party, hey-ey-ey-ey)
Back to my apartment (Apartment, hey-ey-ey-ey)
There's no one here that I know
So take my hand, I want to go
And get this party started back at home


Come on and get it started, yeah
Come on and get it started, no love (Back at home)
Come on and get it (Back at home)


There's no one here that I know
So take my hand, I want to go
And get this party started back at homeEmbed
1 ContributorLittle Bird - Deluxe Edition LyricsIf we take this bird in, with its broken leg
We could nurse it, she said
Come inside for a little lie down with me
And if you fall asleep it wouldn't be the worst thing
But when i wake up, and your makeup is on my shoulder
And tell me if I lie down, would you stay now?
Let me hold ya, ohh

But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth
Darling how I miss you, strawberry's taste how lips do
And its not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet
Cause that leads to regret, diving into soon
And I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird

My little bird

If we take a walk out, in the morning dew
We could lay down, so I'm next you
Come inside for a little home made tea
And if you fall asleep, then at least your next to me
And if I wake up, say its late love get back to sleep
I'm covered by nature and I'm safe now
Underneath this oak tree, with you beside me

But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth
Darling how I miss you, strawberry's taste how lips do
And its not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet
Cause that leads to regret, diving into soon
And I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird

My little bird

My little bird

My little bird

And of all this thing I'm sure of, I'm not quite certain of your love
You made me scream but then I made you cry when I left that little bird with its broken leg to die

But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth
Darling how I miss you, strawberry's taste how lips do
And its not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet
Cause that leads to regret, diving into soon
But I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird

My little bird, whoa oh oh oh whoaa

My little bird

My little bird

2 You Break Me 2 Lyrics
Well my friend it seems we’ve come too far to disagree
My knees feel weak and I fell too fast
The tide is high but we swam in too deep
To catch your breath you tear me apart piece by piece
You can take away all this mess
And I could never think anything less of you


‘Cos you break me
You numb me
You still seem to stun me
This pain has outrun me
You are all I have left


The tide flows out as I leave empty rooms
To spur this on we left that room too long
You open wide and all the lies flow out
To eat you whole
But we both know that you’re too cold
And she said ‘I can put away all those lies
And show you there’s no surprise in me’


Well still, you break me
You numb me
You still seem to stun me
This pain has outrun me
You are all that I have left

Exorcise these demons
But they keep talking to me
I am no believer
But I believe you will relieve me
I believe you will relieve me
And that’s what’s going on




You break meEmbed
6 2step (Irish Remix) Lyrics
I had a bad week
Spent the evening pretending it wasn't that deep
You could see in my eyes that it was taking over
I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment
You know you take all of my stress right down
Help me get it off my chest and out
Into the ether with the rest of this mess that just keeps us depressed
We forget that we're here right now


'Cause we're livin' life at a different pace, stuck in a constant race
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break, something's gotta change
We should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn
If we're missin' out on what the people think is right
Seein' through a picture behind the screen and forget to be
Lose the conversation for the message that you'll never read
I think maybe you and me
Oh, we should head out to the place where the music plays
And then


We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone, then loved
And all we need is us to go all

Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us


Slow down when I can't feel myself
Looking right but knowing that there's nothing left
So slow wine for the sour grapes
'Cause moving on isn't up for debate
I still wonder where the time's gone (Am I wrong?)
Sometimes I don't wanna be strong (They alarm)
With all these expectations of what I should be
CC'd in so many threads that I can't see me
Even when I'm struggling
I bless my enemies so much they feel they owe me something
Shatter pains like ceilings, even when I barely function
It's wahala but mahalo
Got my two-step, so the beat's the only thing I have to follow, uh


We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone, then loved
And all we need is us to go all

Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us to go all night
Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us to go all nightEmbed
4 Grade 8 (Acoustic) LyricsMy mind is a warrior
My heart is a foreigner
My eyes are the colour of red like the sunset
I'll never keep it bottled up
And left to the hands of the coroner
Be a true heart not a follower
We're not done yet
And i see it in your movements tonight
If we should ever do this right
Im never gonna let you down
Oh I'll never let you down
Now keep it on the down low
And I'll keep you around so ill know
That ill never let you down
I'll never let you down
Your strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8
But i never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let
You down
Your strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8
But i never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let
You down

My eyes are a river filler
This drink is a liver killer
Your chest is a pillow for my weary head to lay to rest
Again
Your body is my ballpoint pen
And your mind is my new best friend
Your eyes are the mirror to take me to the edge again
Now I see it in your movements tonight
If we should ever do this right
Im never gonna let you down
Oh I'll never let you down
We'll keep it on the down low
And I'll keep you around so ill know
That I'll never let you down
I'll l never let you down
Your strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8
But i never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let
You down
Your strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8
But i never felt this way
Ill pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let
You down
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now, and I'll
Never let you down
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now, and I'll
Never let you down
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now, and I'll
Never let you down
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now, and I'll

3 The A Team (KOAN Sound Remix) LyricsThe angel will die
Closed eye
This time, we’ll fade out tonight
We don’t wanna go outside, tonight
And in a pipe, she flies to the motherland
It’s too cold outside
For angels to fly

Angel will die
Closed eye
This time, we’ll fade out tonight
We don’t wanna go outside, tonight
And in a pipe, she flies to the motherland
It’s too cold outside
For angels to fly

And they say
They scream
They see
Slowly sinking, wasting
And they say
They scream
They see
Slowly sinking, wasting

An angel will die
Closed eye
This time, we’ll fade out tonight
We don’t wanna go outside, tonight
And in a pipe, she flies to the motherland
It’s too cold outside
For angels to fly
For angels to fly
To fly
To fly

2 One - Live and in Session Lyrics
Tell me that you'll turn down the man
Who asks for your hand
Cause you're waiting for me
And I know, you're gonna be away a while
But I've got no plans at all to leave
And would you take away my hopes and dreams?
And just stay with me


All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll never leave again
Cause you are the only one


Take my hand and my
Heart and soul, I will
Only have these eyes for you
And you know, everything changes but
We'll be strangers if we see this through
You could stay within these walls and bleed
Or just stay with me, oh Lord now

All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
Cause you are the only one


Stumbling half drunk, getting myself lost
I am so gone, so tell me the way home
I listen to sad songs, singing about love
And where it goes wrong


All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
Cause you are the only oneEmbed
3 Stevensong Lyrics
Stevie was a boy
Who turned into a man
He never had no master plan
But I knew that he could
Find right from wrong
Sing me a different song
He told me which road to take
And now I’m gone


Keep on singing
Make her life whole
Stevie you’re winning
And I just feel cold
Take your life beyond the mark
You can do no wrong
When I lose my way in the dark
Keep singing your song


Please come follow me
I find it hard to breathe
Please come follow me
I find it hard to breatheEmbed
4 Could Never Be Mad Lyrics
I'm coming down, coming home
Not ’cause I left without my coat
There's just some things you need to know, know, know
Your eyes, they are a window to your soul
It's such a lovely place to go
Think I should tell you more, you know, know, know


But now I’m older
Drips are coming off my shoulder
All I need is closure
On what you said to me
'Cause I


I can never be mad with you, baby
'Cause the love that we have is amazing
You drive me (Drive me) crazy (Crazy)
But that ain't a bad thing, no, no, no
I can never be mad, mad, mad
I can never be mad


Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

No, I don't really want to fight
Let's keep the conversation light
Spark thе candles, pour the wine-inе-ine
My father gave me good advice
Sort out your problems by the time
That you finally close your eyes at night


But now I'm older
Drips are coming off my shoulder
All I need its closure
On what you said to me
'Cause I


I can never be mad with you, baby
’Cause the love that we have is amazing
You drive me (Drive me) crazy (Crazy)
But that ain’t a bad thing, no, no, no
I can never be mad, mad, mad
I can never be mad


Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I can be awful sometimes
But we both just crossed the line
I wanna make this so right
But this time


I can never be mad with you, baby
'Cause the love that we have is amazing
You drive me (Drive me) crazy (Crazy)
But that ain’t a bad thing, no, no, no
I can never be mad, mad, mad
I can never be mad

1 ContributorCould Just Be The Bassline Lyrics
Standing at the bar
And your eyes are telling me come closer
But if you could see me dance
There's no way that you would let me hold ya
I feel you pulling on my hand more
And dragging me to the dance floor
All my inhibitions fall away
Feel the rhythm of the track
And telling the DJ pull it back...
With a whisper in my ear I hear you say


Softly do you feel that you could love me
And want me
More than anybody else
But then again


It could just be the baseline
That made me close my eyes
opened up my mind
Could you come back with me tonight
It's not the first time
that we've been on our own
So I'll hold you close
And never let you go

You can keep me on the dance floor
But I don't wanna waste your time
Feel the rhythm of your hips more
It makes me wanna taste your wine
It's getting hard to keep in time
When I'm looking in your eyes
Everyone but you just fades away
Feeling the rhythm of the track
And telling the DJ pull it back
With a whisper in my ear I hear you say


Softly do you feel that you could love me
and want me
more than anybody else
but then again


It could just be the bassline
That made me close my eyes
opened up my mind
Could you come back with me tonight
It's not the first time
that we've been on our own
So I'll hold you close
And never let you go

How, could I take you home tonight
I should be hailing a cab
But I don't wanna leave just yet cos I knowEmbed
1 ContributorWho You Are (Jessie J Cover) LyricsI stare at my reflection in the mirror
Why am I doing this to myself?
Losing my mind on a tiny error
I nearly left the real me on the shelf
No

Don't lose who you are
In the blur of the stars
Seeing is deceiving
Dreaming is believing
It's okay not to be okay
Sometimes it's hard
To follow your heart

Tears don't mean you're losing
Everybody's bruising
Just be true to who you are

Who you are, who you are, who you are
Who you are, who you are, who you are
Who you are, who you are, who you are
Who you are, who you are, who you are

Brushing my hair
Do I look perfect?
I forgot what to do to fit the mold
The more I try
The less it's working
Yeah
When everything inside me screams
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Yeah

Don't lose who you are
In the blur of the stars
Seeing is deceiving
Dreaming is believing
It's okay not to be okay
Sometimes it's hard
To follow your heart
Tears don't mean you're losing
Everybody's bruising
Just be true to who you are

Fake shows, egos
Fake shows like woah
And leave me alone
Real talk, real life
Good love, goodnight
With a smile
Thats my home
Thats my home
Thats my home
Don't lose who you are
In the blur of the stars
Seeing is deceiving
Dreaming is believing
It's okay not to be okay
Sometimes it's hard
To follow your heart
Tears don't mean you're losing
Everybody's bruising
Just be true to who you are
Who you are, who you are, who you are
Who you are, who you are, who you are
Who you are, who you are, who you are
Who you are, who you are, who you are
Who you are, who you are, who you are
Who you are, who you are, who you are
Who you are, who you are, who you are
Who you are, who you are, who you are
Who you are, who you are, who you are
Who you are, who you are, who you are
Who you are, who you are, who you are

2 Shape of You (Galantis Remix) Lyrics
The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me, I’ll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance


Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead


I'm in love
I’m in love

I'm in love (dance)

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I’m in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I’m in love with your body

I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
(I’m in love with the shape of you)


I'm in love
I'm in love

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play

Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead


I'm in love

2 Thinking Out Loud (Campfire Version) LyricsWhen your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?

And darling I will be loving you 'til we're 70
Baby, my heart could still fall as hard at 23
I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Oh me I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
Now, I'm thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mmm
I know you will still love me the same

'Cause honey your soul can never grow old, it is evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

But baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are

Oh, baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh maybe we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we areEmbed
2 These Dreams Lyrics
I keep my hopes and dreams inside you amongst these other things
My mother seems to never see the bruises that I'm covering
Never been known as my government name
My foster home is where I've been placed away from the pain
And now you sit before me, with a folder holding my story
You're my saviour with nothing on me but hope and glory
And surely, you'll never ignore me
'cos when the court came the court date was made to disappear for me
You think you understand me, but never what I went through
But you were never meant to, I won't hold it against you
I take a ball point pen to play dot to dot
With the cigarette burns etched in my forearms
Forget me not, never let me stop, you'll just sit and watch
It's your job to be patient so you'll let me off
So come with me take a walk on the wild side
And see life in a day through a child's eyes


And these dreams are all I have to hold me
When sleep's the only thing I want to take me away, away


Okay session's over time to get back to the classroom
I hate this lesson and I guess the teacher finds it hard too
You told me I should try my best but guess what, I still find this trigonometry a head fuck
Constantly told I won't pass my GCSEs
I'll end up in Mac D's serving burgers and cheese
But you told me I can do anything if I put my mind to it
Mistakes make a change if you put a line through 'em
Lately classmates think I'm crazy
Turn up daily resembling Bill Bailey
And I ain't saying that I can't be groomed with it
Without new clothes or shower it's hard to do so
After school you'll take me shopping for some new clothes
But they'll get taken off me when I get back to the group home
So come with me take a walk on the wild side
And see life in a day through a child's eyes

3 Bad Habits (Jubël Remode) Lyrics
Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful


My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's truе
My bad habits lead to you


My bad habits lead to you
My bad habits lead to—


Evеry pure intention ends when the good times start
Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
It started under neon lights and then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you


My bad habits lead to you


My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, it's true


My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you

1 ContributorBeautiful People (Live At Abbey Road) Lyrics
We are, we are, we are


L.A. on a Saturday night in the summer
Sundown and they all come out
Lamborghinis and their rented Hummers
The party's on, so they're headin' downtown ('Round here)
Everybody's lookin' for a come up
And they wanna know what you're about
Me in the middle with the one I love and
We're just tryna figure everything out


We don't fit in well 'cause we are just ourselves
I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
This is my only fear: that we become


Beautiful people
Drop top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
"What d'you do?" and "Who d'you know?"
Inside the world of beautiful people
Champagne and rolled-up notes
Prenups and broken homes
Surrounded, but still alone
Let's leave the party

That's not who we are (We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful
Yeah, that's not who we are (We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful (Beautiful)


L.A., mmm, drove for hours last night and we made it nowhere (Nowhere, nowhere)
I see stars in your eyes when we're halfway there (All night)
I'm not fazed by all them lights and flashin' cameras
'Cause with my arms around you, there's no need to care

1 ContributorCastle on the Hill (Throttle Remix) Lyrics
When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I


Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home


I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill


Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home


I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hillEmbed

But I know I was happier with you
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Happier with you
Happier with you
Happier with you


Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're moving on with someone new

'Cause baby you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you
Hey yeah, hey yeahEmbed

Night, night
Two-stepping with the woman I
Two-stepping with the woman I
Low then up
Alone then loved
And all we need is)

I had a bad week
Spent the evening pretending it wasn't that deep
You could see in my eyes that it was taking over
I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment

You know you take all of my stress right down
Help me get it off my chest and out
Into the ether with the rest of this mess that just keeps us deprеssed
We forget that wе're here right now

Seeing through a picture behind a screen and forget to be
Lose the conversation for the message that you'll never read
I think maybe you and me
Oh, we should head out to the place where the music plays
And then we'll go all night
Two-stepping with the woman I
Night
Two-stepping with the woman I
Love, love
Electrified, we'll keep turning up and go all
Night, night
Two-stepping with the woman I

Two-stepping with the woman I

And all we need is us to go all

Night, night
Two-stepping with the woman I, night
Night, yeah
And all we need is us to go all
Night, night
Two-stepping with the woman I love
Night, yeah
And all we need is us

What do you reckon, is it just me?
Words and weapons, and occasionally they cut deep
Crisis of confidence, it tends to come when I feel the dark
And I open my heart
If you don't see it, you should trust me
I feel like I've got nothing left right now
Except this beauty in her dress right now
She got me feeling like the best
And the rest are just less than she needs
So we press play and step to the beat

'Cause we're living life at a different pace
Stuck in a constant race
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break
Something's got to change
We should just be cancelling all our plans
And not give a damn
Head out to the place where it plays, and we'll go all night

Two-stepping with the woman I
Night
Two-stepping with the woman I
Love, love
Electrified, we'll keep turning up and go all

Two-stepping with the woman I

1 ContributorFulham Broadway LyricsI’m so tired today
Was meant to catch that train
From Fulham Broadway but I missed it
And I rang you up to check how you’ve done
And your eyes shine like gold from the sun to me
And I hear that you have messed it all up again
I’ll be right there to catch you
Like I’m gonna catch this train
And I’ll always be here you know
I will love your smile and love your way
As long as you can let it show
I can’t wait
I can’t wait
I can’t wait
I can’t wait
Am I lost or stuck
These females don’t give up
I guess my dumb luck
For getting shot down in the crossfire
All that I can say
Is I’ll walk away
It’s a game they play
If I’m shot down in the crossfire
I can’t wait
And she can’t drive yet
But she can drive me to a point of mental craze
And she will wind me up
She’s the sort of girl that keeps you hanging on and on for days
And I
I can’t wait
I can’t wait
I can’t wait
I can’t wait
Am I lost or stuck
These females don’t give up
I guess my dumb luck
For getting shot down in a crossfire
All that I can say
Is I’ll walk away
It’s a game they play
If I’m shot down in the crossfire
I can’t wait
Broken hearted
I’ve departed
To a place I feel more comfortable
And I belong here
Don’t shed no tear
Just remember I’ll be back again
I can’t wait
I can’t wait
I can’t wait
I can’t wait
Am I lost or stuck
These females don’t give up
I guess my dumb luck
For getting shot down in the crossfire
All that I can say
Is I’ll walk away
Its a game they play
If I’m shot down in the crossfire
I’m so tired today
Was meant to catch that train
From Fulham Broadway but I missed itEmbed
1 ContributorThe city - raps LyricsLook its funny how the city where the Queen sleeps
Still ain’t got clean streets
But there ain’t a day when she ain’t got clean sheets
Homeless people roam with needles and
You’ve got to pay tax to afford a vehicle
Tube fare doubles up every two years
And the buses upstairs are a no go area
Man are like ‘Pass me your mobile, here me now’
And with the crunch of the credit
You can’t get a roof over your head
You’re stuck in the debit
But every single month they come for the debit
Direct action, if you don’t play they
Dive and snatch things and it don’t say that
Now equipped fear ‘cause a victim of inflation
The black letters turned red and they been patient
And now six years rent has just been wasted



I’m from a city where the rain won’t cease
Pollution in the air matches that on the street
The black smoke gets your head into a muddle, like
Walking into elephant syringes in the puddle, like
I was a country boy when I moved out
Grew up too fast for my family to find out
Now I try to stop my music running into nosedives
Can’t resort to arrogance with white lies
This city won’t erase me
But I can’t help to see how this dark city changed me
It’s all the same see, music is my life, but
Now I try to fight whatever I need to hide from
North, South, East, West, London’s my home now
Knees weak, but we never slow down
Now I start to do my music properly
And stay from all the negative shit that will follow me


Hey, look, I'm from a city full of jammed up traffic, night buses
All-night clubbers, Kings Cross to all-night lovers
That knew when to pay rent and stay in their apartment
Talented buskers playing that guitar riff
The church pastor's still praying for answers
Way too much congestion, they're charging
Way too much for petrol, I'm laughing
But there ain't no funny side
It's like winter all year, there ain't no summer time
Stone Island jacket, keep warm
And all phone lines are tapped, you've been warned
And also mind the gap and keep calm
Cause one wrong move on the train, big beard
And it's gunshots, two in your brain, it's weird
So as much as I'm in love with this city
Just maybe I've had enough of the cityEmbed
3 Sing (Live @ 1Live Radiokonzert) LyricsIt's late in the evening
Glass on the side
I've been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignoring everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
I don't wanna know
If you're getting ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no-man's land
For the longest time lady

I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know

Oh Oh Oh Oooooooh 2x

If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushin' through you from your head to toe

Oh Oh Oh Oooooooh 2x
SING!
Ohhhhooohhhhoooo
Louder!
Ohhhhooohhhhoooo
SING!
Ohhhhooohhhhoooo

This love is a blaze I saw flames from the side of the
Stage
And the firebrigade comes in a couple of days
Until then we got nothing to say and nothing to know but
Something to drink and maybe something to smoke
Let it go until I roll with the chain
Singing we found love in a local rave
No I don't really know what I'm supposed to say but I can
Just figure it out and hope and pray
I told her my name and said it's nice to meet ya then she
Handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know it she's a keeper
Just from this once small act of kindness I'm in
Deep if anybody finds out I am meant to drive home but i
Took all of it now I'm not sobering up
We just sit on the couch one thing led to another now she's
Kissing my mouth

I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know
Oh Oh Oh Ohhhhhh 2x

If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushin' through you from your head to toe

Oh Oh Oh Ohhhhhh 2x

SING!
Ohhhhooohhhhoooo
Louder!
Ohhhhooohhhhoooo
SING!
Ohhhhooohhhhoooo

Can you feel it?
All the guys in here don't even wanna dance...
Can you feel it?
All that I can hear is music from above
Can you feel it?
Found you hot in here so I hope you'll take my hand darling
Before the beat kicks in again

Can you feel it? Oooohooohooo wappaaa
Can you feel it? Oooohhoooo no no no

SING!
I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know

Oh Oh Oh Ohhhhhh 2x

SING!

If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rush undo you from your head to toe

Oh Oh Oh Ohhhhhh 2x

SING!Embed

2 The A Team - Live and in Session Lyrics
White lips, pale face
Breathing in the snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, day's end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men


And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us


Cause she's just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple of grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly

Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone


And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us


Cause she's just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple of grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly

An angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eyes and hoping for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line


And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us


And we're all under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple of grams
And we don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
Fly, fly
For angels to fly
To fly, to fly
For angels to dieEmbed
5 Drunk (Rudimental Remix) Lyrics
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk


I wanna be drunk when I wake up
On the right side of the wrong bed
And never an excuse I made up
Tell you the truth I hate
What didn't kill me, it never made me stronger at all
Love will scar your makeup lip sticks to me
So now I'll maybe lean back there
I'm sat here, wishing I was sober
I know I'll never hold you like I used to


I'll be drunk
I'll be drunk again (Drunk)
I'll be drunk again (Drunk)
I'll be drunk again (Drunk)
I'll be drunk


I'll be drunk again (Drunk)
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love
Drunk, drunk
Drunk
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
Drunk, drunk
To feel a little love


Drunk, drunk
I'll be drunk again
Drunk, drunk
I'll be drunk


I'll be drunk again (Drunk)
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love


Drunk, drunk
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
Drunk, drunk
To feel a little love


All by myself
All by myself
All by myself
All by myselfEmbed
2 Afterglow (Acoustic) Lyrics
(One, two)


Stop the clocks, it's amazing
You should see the way the light dances off your hair
A million colours of hazel, golden, and red
Saturday morning is fading
The sun's reflected by the coffee in your hand
My eyes are caught in your gaze all over again


We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle
Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow
So alone in love like the world had disappeared
Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go
I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow
And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears


Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow


The weather outside's changing
The leaves are buried under six inches of white
The radio is playing Iron & Wine
This is a new dimension
This is a level where we're losin' track of time
I'm holdin' nothin' against it, except you and I

We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle
Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow
So alone in love like the world had disappeared
Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go
I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow
And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears


Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglowEmbed
3 You Need Me, I Don’t Need You (Live at iTunes Festival: London 2012) Lyrics
Now I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That's you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud
I can't, no, I won't hush
I'll say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now (Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow)
See, I'm true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me


'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man

I sing and write my own tune and I write my own verse, hell
Don't need another wordsmith to make my tunes sell
Call yourself a singer-writer, you're just bluffing
Name's on the credits and you didn't write nothing
I sing fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to BRIT School
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can't last if I'm smoking on a crack pipe
And I won't be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia
And musically I'm demonstrating
Whenever I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the Enterprise when some fella filmed me
Young singer-writer like a Gabriella Cilmi, yeah, yeah


'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man

All I want in this cold world is to make music and use it
Not to abuse it and get affected, infected with the who's who of music
Who did it, who is it, who's in it or what the hell does it matter?
Chitter chatter, don't matter what a yidder, yidder, yadder, don't matter to me
All I want is a bit of dignity in me to battle this industry freely
To be me in this seedy, needy world, can you hear me?
Hey, so I keep singing that
When I first started this rapping shit I felt pressure from haters
Became invaded with sadists and just developed a hater radar
I made for the stars, kept my grind in the dark
Then appeared with a remedy kicking rhymes with a melody
Hennesey shots and all these fools on the block
Who said you gotta be a gangster now to raise to the top?
I'm just a normal, casual, usual, everyday type of guy
With my head in the sky, Ed Sheeran, Urban Angel coming ready to die
So see the signs, stand to the side
Open your eyes and take a look and realize
The resurrection's arrived and as the mist clears
I arise from my tomb in disguise, all alone, Alonestar
Urban Angel rising from the ashes
Surprising all haters, guiding, now moving steady


You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Mummy, I've got the X if you're into taking drugs
Into having sex, I ain't into making love
Come give me a hug if you're into getting rough
You can find me in the club, got a bottle full of bubbly
Mummy, I've got the X if you're into taking drugs
Into having sex, I ain't into making love
Come give me a hug if you're into getting rough

'Cause you need me, man, I don't, sing it out
You need me, man, I don't, scream it
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't


My eyes are red, I've been burning, I've been burning
My eyes are red, I've been burning, I've been burning
My eyes are red, I've been burning
I've been burning on a spliff off your high grade
My eyes are red, I've been burning
I've been burning, burning, burning


Now where I come from, burning weed it is a habit
A big fat bag of high grade weed, you know I got to have it
'Cause if I don't have it in my pocket, I'm going to panic
'Cause like I said where I come from, weed smoking is a habit
We'll do da bun in the place up in the hood
One of them things I have inherited like a ghetto man should
One of them things is smoking weed it yes it makes me feel good
Burning high grade sensimilla, yes it makes me feel
But me is a man, ah, talk about sensimilla is a drug
And if I start to smoke it I'm gonna turn into a thug
Where I come from that they talking could that only get you mugged
Where I come from, burning weed, it is a blessing from above
Where I come from, yes, we bun it when we listen rub a dub
Where I come from, yes, we bun after we just-a make a love
Where I come from, yes, we bun it when the sun starts shine
I blaze high grade weed all the time


Welcome to Jamrock, camp whe' the thugs dem camp at
Two pound a weed inna van back
It inna yuh hand bag, yuh nap sack, it inna yuh back pack
And ah give yah girlfriend contact
Some bwoy nuh know dis, dem only come around like tourist
On the beach with a few club sodas
Bedtime stories, pose like dem name Chuck Norris
And they don't know the real hardcore
'Cause Sandals ah no "Back-To," thugs dem wi' do whe' dem got to
And won't think twice to shot you
Don't mek dem spot you, unless you carry guns a lot too
And dem don't stand a chance at all, now my eyes are red


'Cause you need me, I don't need you
You need me, man, my eyes are red
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, my eyes are red
You need me, I don't need you
You need me, man, my eyes are red
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you


Woah
Woah
Woah
Woah
Woah
Woah
Woah
Woah
Woah, woah, hey (Woah)


'Cause with the lyrics, I'll be aiming it right
I won't stop 'til my name's in lights
With stadium heights, with Damian Rice
On red carpets, now I'm on Arabian Nights
'Cause I'm young, I know my brothers gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter, yeah
The game's over, but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows, but
I haven't got a house, plus I live on a couch
So you believe the lyrics when I'm singin' 'em out
Wow, from day one I've been prepared
With V05 wax for my ginger hair
So now I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of
What the future holds 'cause it's another day
Close, close, close, close


I've still got a rucksack with the old clothes, I rap with the cold flows
I'm back with the old jokes, in fact, you don't know
Tracks, I throw blows to make my punchlines relevant
You can't keep up, you'll get none, you're celibate
My flows developing, skin lacks the melanin
Give me a shot of adrenaline and I get it in
Do it for the hell of it
'Cause ever since I hit the mainstream with "The A Team" I seem to sell a bit
I took what held me back with the women, then packaged the image
Put in some content, then sold it back as a gimmick
The fact is this, I'll end up dating actresses
Wake up on dirty mattresses, I think I'll need to practice this
But I make shit happen, call me a laxative
World's on my shoulders, I don't even know what Atlas is
Hard bars sharp like a cactus is
I'm back to rapping, back to back 'cause I've been practicing
I'm back to sing this, yes


You need me, man, sing it out
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, scream it
You need
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't
Devlin


Yo, yo, you need me, but I dont need you
D-E-V-L-I-N, Ed and 32
I'm lyrically more capable to break 'em all
I ain't gotta amputate a lower limb to make you fall
Like autumn, check the post mortem
The game passed away upon the day I came and killed it for his fortune
I don't mean money, I mean luck
And now the clock's aviated and everybody's time's up
Nothing's what I had and everything is what I gave
Like a sprinter near the finish line, fighting for his place
Keep your diamonds and your chains
I can walk for any manner, any time of day and stay safe
'Cause I get respected while they get detested
Told the truth, there ain't nobody that done what Devs did
If you ain't on the tune or Eminem or 5'9
You ain't competition, just a fish, you're tryna bite a line


Sing it, you need me, man, I don't
Make some noise for Devlin
Sing it, you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, scream it out
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you (Yeah)
Sway


All over the radio and back up in the raves again
We got the crowd on the wave like it's a stadium
Call me the weather man, it's 'bout to be a great weekend
I'm on the cloud, let's make it rain again
Nice but naughty, shirts and dresses looking saucy
Living in our minuses 'cause life begins at forty, level up
Call me Bond, James Bond
How I maintain, winner stays on
My brain racing like I'm tryna win the gold for Britain
I'm on a one-track mind, let's go the distance
We're only stopping when we pose for pictures
And now we move so wavy, we get motion sickness
I choose if you're hearing
Sway started rapping, now you're fearing
Hands in the air, start screaming
I say Ed, you say— peace, yeah


You need me, man, I don't
Make some noise for Sway and keep singing that hook, it goes
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, sing it out, sing it out
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't
Chip


Ayy
It's funny how money change the situations
And miscommunication leads to complications
Shouts to Meek Mills when your dream chasing
The people at the back love confrontation
Finsy Park to Tottenham Hale were my stations
Me, Twiss, and Dredd used to bump the train
No Victoria line, me I made a lane
Take notes from my career and them keep the
These kids can't test me, I'm on my grown
Still with Sammy, I ain't on my own
If I wear red bottoms you won't even know
'Cause you won't catch me in pictures tryna show my soles
CMAR, we come and done the place
Ice ever melts, man a flood the place
Red, white, and blue diamonds, me and Wretch are the same
And yeah, we in the same chamber, but ain't the same chain


You need me, man, I don't
Make some noise everybody (Give it up for Ed Sheeran)
You need me, man, I don't
One more time, make some noise for Chip
Say, you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, scream it out, scream it out
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you


You need three, man, I don't need two
Not none of ya, unorthodox runner up
In my own lane like I'm stepping on a double clutch
No brakes, cut them up, the tyres stay screeching
Now I've found out being odd ain't even
Qualified for everything, long straight season
Not a dilemma king, got a straight queening
You are what you eat, that's something to believe in
MC with the mic, MC dinner time
I'm feeling gassed, like, MC give me light
Didn't even have to do a disco rap
I bet I still end up with a Sisqó plaque
This is what happens when your gift is talent
And all you imagined exists, imagine
I never drop shit, but I came from the back end
Now I've got the game in my palm, I'ma smash it


You need me, man, I don't
Make some noise for Wretch 32 (Ed Sheeran)
You need me, man, sing it out (Ah yeah)
You need me, man, scream it
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, now everybody go


Oh, oh, oh
Go oh, oh, oh
Go oh
Go oh
Go woo
Go woo-ah

Right, so this is the point in the gig where we change a little bit
One more time, make some noise for my beautiful guests
Devlin, Sway, Chip, Wretch 32
This is where we change it, right
At the beginning, you were the gospel choir
Now you're in competition with each other
You are split down the middle
This side, all along the back into the middle, up top, you are one side
This side, all along the front into the middle, up top, you are one side
To make this a little more interesting, we're gonna use some roleplay
There's a film called West Side Story
In West Side Story, you have two rival gangs
Jets and Sharks, and they don't get on
And they come to a final battle with guns, knives, and bats
They're running towards each other, running, running, ah
Stop, sing
This is how it's gonna work, each side, you are one gang each
We're gonna use volume, not violence
Right, all along the front to the back into the middle of this side, up top, you guys are the Jets
All along the front, right 'round to the back into the middle, up top of this side, you guys are the Sharks
Jets, give me a "Hell yeah"
Sharks, give me a "Woop, woop"
Jets, give me a "Wow"
Sharks, give me a "Hell yeah"
Right, this is how it's gonna work
Each side, you get one thing to sing
Jets, you're gonna be "You need me"
Sharks, you're gonna be "My eyes are red"
The trick is this is not a singing thing, this is a volume thing
However loud you scream, you win
Jets and Sharks, "You need me, my eyes are red, it goes like this
Scream it out as loud as you can, Jets first, then Sharks

You need me, man, I don't, scream it out
You need me, man, scream it
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, keep it goin'
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, Sharks, here we go
You need me, man, my eyes are red
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, my eyes are red
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, my eyes are red
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, my eyes are red
You need me, man, now scream it out, scream it
My eyes are red

You need me (Man, I don't need you)
(You need me, man, my eyes are red)
(You need me, man, I don't need you)
You need me, man, my eyes are red
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, my eyes are red

Okay, we're gonna change the competition now
To a KRS-One tune called "The Sound of the Police"
Each side gets one thing to sing
We're gonna start off as quietly as possible
Then get as loud as we can, like this

Woop, woop, that's the sound of the police
Woop, woop, that's the sound of the police
Woop, woop, that's the sound of the police
Woop, woop, that's the sound of the police
Woop, woop, that's the sound of the police
Woop, woop, that's the sound of the police
Woop, woop, that's the sound of the police
Woop, woop, that's the sound of the beast, sing
Woop, woop, that's the sound of the police
(Woop, woop, that's the sound of the police)
(Woop, woop, that's the sound of the police)
(Woop, woop) That's the sound of the beast, sing
Woop, woop, that's the sound of the police
Woop, woop, that's the sound of the beast
Woop, woop, that's the sound of the police
Woop, woop, that's the sound, everybody go

Oh, oh, oh
Go oh, oh, oh
Go you need me, man, I don't need you
Go you need me, man, I don't need you
Go you need me, man, I don't need you
Go you need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man


I'll keep my last name forever, keep this genre pretty basic
And I'll be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it
Replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rapper shoes, using new laces
I'm selling CDs from my rucksack, aiming for the papers
Selling CDs from my rucksack, aiming for the majors
Nationwide tour with Just Jack, I still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache
I hit back, when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Primark tee
I'm still the same as a year ago, but more people hear me though
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos
I'm always doing shows, if I'm not, I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up, call me Rufio
Melody music maker, reading all the papers
They say I'm up-and-coming like I'm fucking in an elevator


'Cause you need me, man, scream it out
You need me, man, I don't, sing it out
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, scream it
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, take it up one more and go
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need youEmbed
1 ContributorCastle On The Hill (NWYR Remix) Lyrics
When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I


Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home


I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

Over the castle on the hill


And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hillEmbed
1 ContributorDrown me out - + ghetts LyricsI'm in so deep Omar Eds can relate to my situation its so real
Pain ain't the emotion I wanna feel but I'm thriving off it so it's only right, I like this topic
I'll be on a hill, keeping my head above water
I can't afford to ever get caught in a corner
So I move with the force of a sorcerer
It's dark when I'm about just me myself and my shadow
Im paro, running out of ammo, and it seems everybody around me is on the same path so it's narrow
Then less than a more proof for the last one left so they don't leave me as wet as an umbrella
I play fool to catch wise how we ever gonna get so clever
How can I be at my best with this pressure
I got a lot to loose but when I watch the news my mind's infected with terror
No wonder I'm under stress, I got my door kicked off by a bunch of feds
And when they left It looked like I had rave and invited more than a hundred guests
Oh-o-oh
I should of bust the back door and jump the fence
It seems the way you look back, should of, would of could of but I bet you can't bring shit with a good back
Back to fifteen our face to myself, then I'm more than a hood track

Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you won't ever drown me out
Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you won't ever drown me out, out, out
You won't drown me out, out, out
Youuuuu won't drown me out

You can't ever drown me out, the water supplies too low
And I'm around 6'1, 10 stone
I never seen someone drown with insufficient amount of liquid in my lungs
A violent MC, my mouth can vouch
Do I sound like I'm choking? Seriously, do I sound like I'm joking?
I'm floating, even though that they wanna send me to the bottom of the ocean
But I am a ship that's so many years, but I'm maintaining
Plain sailing, no commotion
Like a dolphin, when it's in motion
But i can't break me, so why would I show them I'm broken
No real shit, throw my skin ain't close to corrosion
Fuck em all, this ain't no tug a war, still don't get roped in the open, I don't wanna reveal my violent side
But I swear that I will soon if the Lord above don't provide a sign
Then I'ma kill you, arm for arm, eye for eye
Nah, I just wanna live my life, but you don't wanna see this guy survive

Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you won't ever drown me out
Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you won't ever drown me out, out, out
You won't drown me out
You won't drown me out

Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you won't ever drown me out
Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you won't ever drown me out, out, out
You won't drown me out
You won't drown me outEmbed

2 The A Team (Shy FX’s Ackee and Saltfish Remix) Lyrics
White lips, pale face
Breathing in the snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, day's end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men


And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us


Cause she's just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple of grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly

Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone


And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us


Cause she's just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple of grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly

An angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eyes and hoping for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line


Cause we're all under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple of grams
And we don't want to go outside tonight
Cause in a pipe we'll flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to flyEmbed

2 This Year’s Love LyricsThis year's love had better last
Heaven knows it's high time
I've been waiting on my own
Too long
And when you hold me like you do
It feels so right, oh now
I start to forget how my heart gets torn
When that hurt gets thrown
Feeling like you can't go on
Turning circles and time again
Cut like a knife, oh now
If ya love me got to know
For sure
Cause it takes something more this time
Than sweet sweet lies, oh now
Before I open up my arms and fall
Losing all control
Every dream inside my soul
When ya kiss me on that midnight street
Sweep me off my feet
Singing ain't this life so sweet
This year's love it better last
This year's love it better last
Cause who's to worry if our hearts get torn
When that hurt get thrown
Don't ya know this life goes on
Won't ya kiss me on that midnight street
Sweep me off my feet
Singing ain't this life so sweet
This year's love it better last
This year's love it better lastEmbed

1 ContributorNightmares - + Random Impulse + Sway + Wretch 32 LyricsThey tell me you can only dream when you fell asleep
But now I'm working to achieve, but sleep is the only thing I never see
And I vowed that my breathing with never cease
To the retrieve then I can't let them be
I won't let 'em leave and I had the same feeling since 17
But I wasn't ready then like a lemon screen?
Now I'm in the magazines almost every week
Cause I'm getting heat like in Tenerife
Right now it's better than it's never been
Never fade like a plant that's evergreen
So I hope to my heart, but my self doubts are getting me
Afraid for my cross, getting dump for the day and I'm getting weak
Cause I'm new, I'm that boy that starts it
They chase dreams together like a slumber party
And now I'm on my own, even though I'm smooth sailing
I'm scared to sing, cause my nightmare is fading

:
When the darkness creeps in
I feel my nightmares watching me
And when my dreams are sleeping
I feel my nightmares watching me
Oh, oh, oh!
I feel my nightmares watching me

You better wake up cause I am making moves
And even when I'm dozing I'm breaking rooms
I'm only hitting the sack when I'm training
Too busy trying to keep up with the latest snooze
Made my bed and that's where I'm heading
I fly straight with the best man I embed 'em
Married to the game was a quiet wedding, then I had to fight to get her
Now I'm taking control of my inception
Cause they try to hit misses with my direction
See they better marry donna cause when I strike, strike
Not even Maradonna is gonna cry, I'm awake at night
The haters know where the family lives
Tell me what I catch, but you're playing knock door ginger
Just gonna lose a lot more, than I need it
They say sleep is the cause of death
But I hear shit because I am deaf
Gang signs I'm N/A reading
I'm a CEO, man you suckers are next
:
When the darkness creeps in
I feel my nightmares watching me
And when my dreams are sleeping
I feel my nightmares watching me
Oh, oh, oh!
I feel my nightmares watching me
They watching me! They watch me sleep!

Let me go!
I fell asleep on sofa, walk up in reality
And daydream about losing my sanity
I've been rhyming forever got a blind flow
So I can see an off note with my eyes closed
But to achieve the dreams you can't doze off cos your dream a sleep
I ain't nodding off but I'm nodding to the beat
I be shocking in my sheets, when I should have been asleep
See, all the dreams I'm fonder
You placed me in the team insomnia
Now, I Mr hard worker
In my nightmares I Mr can't turn up
And I missed my chance worst luck
Trying to hit women I Mr I turn up
Yeah, and I walked from ish
Thinking it will put me to rest on my mattress
:
When the darkness creeps in
I feel my nightmares watching me
And when my dreams are sleeping
I feel my nightmares watching me
Oh, oh, oh!
I feel my nightmares watching me
Watching me!Embed
2 Happier (Tiësto’s AFTR:HRS Remix) Lyrics
Walking down 29th and park
I saw you in another's arm
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier
Saw you walk inside a bar
He said something to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah, you look happier, you do


Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're moving on with someone new


'Cause baby you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you
Hey yeah, hey yeah


Sat in the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself
You're happier, aren't you?

Oh, ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody need you like I do
I know that there's others that deserve you
But my darling, I am still in love with you


But I guess you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I’ll feel it too
I could try to smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Hey yeah, hey yeah


‘Cause baby you look happier, you do
I knew one day you’d fall for someone new
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do
Just know that I’ll be waiting here for youEmbed
2 Sing (Trippy Turtle Remix) LyricsIt's late in the evening
Glass on the side
I've been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignoring everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
I don't wanna know
If you're getting ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no man's land
For the longest time lady

I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know
If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe

Sing!
Louder!
Sing!

This love is ablaze
I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then we got nothing to say and nothing to know
But something to drink and maybe something to smoke
Let it go until our roads are changed
Singing in a local rave, no
I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out and hope and pray
I told her my name and said "it's nice to meet ya"
Then she handed me of a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know if she's a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness
I'm in deep if anybody finds out
I'm meant to drive home but I drunk all of it down
Not sober enough we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another now she's kissing my mouth
I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know
If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe

Sing!
Louder!
Sing!

Can you feel it?
All the guys in here don't even wanna dance
Can you feel it?
All that I can hear is music from the back
Can you feel it?
Found you hiding here so I hoped you'd take my hand darling

Before the beats kicks in again
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know
If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe
Sing!Embed

2 Eyes Closed (Piano Version) Lyrics
I know it's a bad idea
But how can I help myself?
Been inside for most this year
And I thought a few drinks, they might help
It's been a while, my dear
Dealin' with the cards life dealt
I'm still holdin' back these tears
While my friends are somewhere else


I pictured this year a little bit different, wedded in February
I step in the bar, it hit me so hard, oh, how can it be this heavy?
Every song reminds me you're gonе and I feel the lump form in my throat
'Cause I'm herе alone


Just dancin' with my eyes closed
'Cause everywhere I look, I still see you
And time is movin' so slow
And I don't know what else that I can do
So I'll keep dancin' with my


Eye-eye-eye-eyes
Eye-eye-eye-eyes closed
Eye-eye-eye-eyes
So I'll keep dancin' with my

Delusion is here again
And I think you'll come home soon
A word brings me right back in
Then it's only me that's in this room
I guess I could just pretend
The colours are more than blue
But I lost more than my friend
I can't help at missin' you


I pictured this month a little bit different, no one is ever ready
And when it unfolds, you get in a hole, oh, how can it be this heavy?
Everything changes, nothing's the same, except the truth is now you're gone
And life just goes on


So I'm dancin' with my eyes closed
'Cause everywhere I look, I still see you
And time is movin' so slow
And I don't know what else that I can do
So I'll keep dancin' with my


Eye-eye-eye-eyes
Eye-eye-eye-eyes closed
Eye-eye-eye-eyes
So I'll keep dancin' with my
Eye-eye-eye-eyes
Eye-eye-eye-eyes closed
Eye-eye-eye-eyes
Oh, I keep dancin' with my

They're shutting the bar, they're cleanin' the floor
And everyone is already home
But I'm on my own


Still dancin' with my eyes closed
'Cause everywhere I look, I still see you
And time is movin' so slow
And I don't know what else that I can do
So I'll keep dancin' with my

4 Castle on the Hill (Seeb Remix) Lyrics
"" "Over the castle on the hill"


When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back


I'm on my way, driving at 90
Down those country lanes, singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
And we watched the sun—


Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill


Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back


I'm on my way, driving at 90
Down those country lanes, singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
And we watched the sun—

Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill


One friend left to sell clothes
And one works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home


And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real
When we watched the sun—


Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill


Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hillEmbed
5 Shivers (Alok Remix) Lyrics
Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks

4 Drunk (Lazy Jay’s Rave-o-Lution Dub) LyricsI wanna be drunk when I wake up
On the right side of the wrong bed
And every excuse I made up
Tell you the truth I hate
What didn't kill me
It never made me stronger at all
Love will scar your make-up lip sticks to me
So now I'll maybe leave back there
I'm sat here wishing I was sober
I know I'll never hold you like I used to

But our house gets cold when you cut the heating
Without you to hold I'll be freezing
Can't rely on my heart to beat it
'Cause you take part of it every evening
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing
Replace with phrases like when you're leaving me

Should I, should I?
Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love

I wanna hold your heart in both hands
I'll watch it fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can
And I've got no plans for the weekend
So shall we speak then
Keep it between friends
Though I know you'll never love me like you used to
There maybe other people like us
You see the flicker of the clip when they light up
Flames just create us, burns don't heal like before
You don't hold me anymore

On cold days Coldplay's out like the band's the name
I know I can't heal things with a hand shake
You know I can't change as I began saying
You cut me wide open like landscape
Open bottles of beer but never champagne
We'll applaud you with the sound that my hands make

Should I, should I?
Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love

All by myself
I'm here again
All by myself
You know I'll never change
All by myself
All by myself
I'm just drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little loveEmbed

2 Make You Feel My Love (Bob Dylan Cover) LyricsWhen the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love

When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you haven’t made your mind up yet
Though I could never do you wrong
I’ve known it from the moment that we met
Deep down in my heart’s where you belong

I’d go hungry; I’d go black and blue
And I’d go crawling down the avenue
No, there is nothing that I wouldn’t do
To make you feel my love

The winds are blowing on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain’t seen nothing like me yet

I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
There is nothing that I would not do
Go to the ends of the Earth for you
To make you feel my love
To make you feel my love
To make you feel my loveEmbed
2 Beautiful People (Danny L Harle Harlecore Remix) Lyrics
We are, we are
We  are, we are
Huge  Danny


L.A. on a Saturday night in the summer
Sundown and they all come out
Lamborghinis  and their rented Hummers
The  party's on, so they're headin' downtown
Everybody's lookin' for a come up
And  they wanna know what you're about
Me in the middle with the one I love and
We're just tryna figure everything out


We don't fit in well 'cause we are just ourselves
I  could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
This is my only fear: that we become


Beautiful people

This is my only fear: that we become
Beautiful people

1 ecret Garden Lyrics
You're what I wanted
You were the one thing I
Keep running back to, back to in my mind
I wanna be there
I wanna go tonight, back to the garden hidden in my mind


So who's to say that I'm not seeking sympathy
I'll find my way back home to the


Secret garden
To the secret garden
You are the place that I run to
Nobody knows but me and you
That secret garden


Remember the night that you and I were laid beneath the poster-covered sky?
You thought my bed-side light was morning


So who's to say that I'm not seeking sympathy
I'll find my way back home to the

Secret garden
To the secret garden
You are the place that I run to
Nobody knows but me and you
That secret garden


And oh-oh, you're so beautiful
And when I close my eyes I'm right by your side in the


Secret garden
In the secret garden, oh
You are the place that I run to
Nobody knows but me and you
That secret garden
To the secret garden
You are the place that I run to
Nobody knows but me and you
That secret garden


Na-na-na-now

1 how Me The Way Lyrics
Slip, trip, fell in love like you cast a spell
Wonder if you're a witch or you'd know you're the only one I think of
When the drink starts flowing, well we know what's involved and we disengage
Well if this is fate then we shouldn't drift apart
Or let it slip away 'til death do us part
Through sickness and in health
I cannot go a day without picturing your face (Not one)
And the way you kiss me lips
I flutter like the first time (Woah)
I'll always come back to you
You're the only one I've chased
But I've made mistakes that could jеopardise everything
I'm tеrrified to lose you


You've picked me off the floor
When I am steaming drunk (That's so true)
You are the oxygen
Inside these aching lungs
Show me the way to fall in love
Show me the way to fall in love


It's the light shade of everything of what you're asking
'Cause it's a crying shame
If we miss it when it's right under our nose
Show me the way to fall in love
Show me the way to fall in love

You kiss me on my lips
I kiss you on your mouth
It shouldn't feel like this
But it just fucking does
Show me the way to fall in love
Show me the way to fall in love


I tell you hold my hand
And darling don't be scared
You might not understand
But I'll always be there
Show me the way to fall in love, yeah
Show me the way to fall in love


If you could walk a summer
Wearing my walnut shoes
You'd know you've found another
Who felt as much as you
Show me the way to fall in love (Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight)
Show me the way to fall in love


It's the light shade of everything of what you're asking
'Cause it's a crying shame
If we miss it when it's right
Oh, it's the light shade of everything of what you're asking
'Cause it's a crying shame
If we miss it when it's right under our nose
Show me the way to fall in love (Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight)
Show me the way to fall in love (Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight)
Show me the way to fall in love (Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight)
Show me the way to fall in love (Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight)
Show me the way to fall in love (Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight)
Show me the way to fall in love (Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight)
Show me the way to fall in love (Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight)
Show me the way to fall in love

Show me the way to fall in love
Show me the way to fall in love

5 Drunk (Doctor P Remix) Lyrics
I wanna be drunk when I wake up
On the right side of the wrong bed
And never an excuse I made up
Tell you the truth I hate
What didn't kill me, it never made me stronger at all
Love will scar your makeup lip sticks to me
So now I'll maybe lean back there
I'm sat here, wishing I was sober
I know I'll never hold you like I used to


I wanna be drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk
I wanna be drunk, drunk, drunk


Drunk, drunk, drunk
Drunk, drunk, drunk
Drunk, drunk, drunk
Drunk, drunk, drunk


I wanna hold your heart in both hands
Now I'll watch you fizzle at the bottom of a coke can
And I've got no plans for the weekend
So should we speak then? Keep it between friends?
Though I know you'll never love me, like you used to
There may be other people like us
Will see the flicker of the clipper when they light up
Flames just create us, burns don't heal like before
You don't hold me anymore

I wanna be drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk
I wanna be drunk, drunk, drunk


Drunk, drunk, drunk
Drunk, drunk, drunk
Drunk, drunk, drunk
Drunk, drunk, drunk


On cold days cold plays out like the band's name
I know I can't heal things with a handshake
You know I can't change, as I began saying
You cut me wide open like a landscape
Open bottles of beer but never champagne
To applaud you with the sound that my hands make
Should I? Should I?


Maybe I'll get drunk, again
I'll be drunk, again
Maybe I'll get drunk, again
I'll be drunk, againEmbed
5 Drunk (Lazy Jay’s Wasted in London Remix) LyricsI wanna be drunk when I wake up
On the right side of the wrong bed
And never an excuse I made up
Tell you the truth I hate
What didn't kill me
It never made me stronger at all
Love will scar your make-up, lip sticks to me
So now I maybe lean back there
I'm sat here wishing I was sober
I know I'll never hold you like I used to

But a house gets cold when you cut the heating
Without you to hold I'll be freezing
Can't rely on my heart to beat in
'Cause you take parts of it every evening
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing
Replace with phrases like when you're leaving me

Should I, should I?
Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love

I wanna hold your heart in both hands
Not watch it fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can
And I got no plans for the weekend
So should we speak then
Keep it between friends
Though I know you'll never love me like you used to
There may be other people like us
Who see the flicker of the clipper when they light up
Flames just create us but burns don't heal like before
And you don't hold me anymore

On cold days cold plays out like the band's name
I know I can't heal things with a hand shake
You know I can't change as I began saying
You cut me wide open like landscape
Open bottles of beer but never champagne
To applaud you with the sound that my hands make

Should I, should I?
Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love

All by myself
I'm here again
All by myself
You know I'll never change
All by myself
All by myself
I'm just drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little loveEmbed

3 Bad Habits (Remix) (Live at the BRIT Awards 2022) Lyrics
(One, two, three, four)
Ooh, ooh


Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful


My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you


Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you

Every pure intention ends when the good times start
Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
It started under neon lights and then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far


My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you


Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh


We took the long way 'round
And burned 'til the fun ran out, now

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you

3 Overpass Graffiti (TCTS Remix) Lyrics
This is a dark parade
Another rough patch to rain on, to rain on
I know your friends may say
This is a cause for celebration, hip-hip-hooray, love
Photographs in sepia tones
It's so still, the fire's barely fighting the cold alone
There are times when I can feel your ghost
Just when I'm almost letting you go
The cards were stacked against us both


I will always love you for what it's worth
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass
And I know time may change the way you think of us
But I'll remember the way we were, you were the first full stop
Love that will never leave
Baby, you will never be lost on me


This is a goddamn shame
I never wanted to break it or leave us tainted
Know I should walk away
But I just can't replace us or even erase us
The car was stuck, the engine stalled
And both of us got caught out in the snow alone
There were times when I forget the lows
And think the highs were all that we'd ever known
The cards were stacked against us both

I will always love you for what it's worth
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass
And I know time may change the way you think of us
But I'll remember the way we were, you were the first full stop
Love that will never leave
Baby, you will never be lost on me


Lost on me
Baby, you will never be lost on me
Lost on me


Well, I will always love you for what it's worth
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass
And I know time may change the way you think of us
But I'll remember the way we were, you were the first full stop
Love that will never leave
Baby, you will never be lost on me


Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Lost on me
Ooh, graffiti on the overpassEmbed

3 Shivers (Jax Jones Remix) Lyrics
I took an arrow to the heart
I never kissed a mouth that tastes like yours
Strawberries and a somethin' more
Ooh, yeah, I want it all
Lipstick on my guitar
Fill up the engine, we can drive real far
Go dancin' underneath the stars
Ooh, yeah, I want it all
Mmm, you got me feelin' like


I wanna be that guy, I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile, I wanna feel like I'm
Like my soul's on fire, I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah, you got me singin' like


Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back
And we'll say, "Ooh, I love it when you do it like that"
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back

Into the car
On the backseat in the moonlit dark
Wrap me up between your legs and arms
Ooh, I can't get enough
You know you could tear me apart
Put me back together and take my heart
I never thought that I could love this hard
Ooh, I can't get enough
Mmm, you got me feelin' like


I wanna be that guy, I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile, I wanna feel like I'm
Like my soul's on fire, I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah, you got me singin' like


Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back
And we'll say, "Ooh, I love it when you do it like that"
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back

Baby, you burn so hot, you make me shiver
With the fire you got, this thing we started
I don't want it to stop
You know you make me shiver
Baby, you burn so hot, you make me shiver
With the fire you got, this thing we started
I don't want it to stop
You know you make me shiver
Yeah, you got me singin' like


Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back (Oh, no)
And we'll say, "Ooh, I love it when you do it like that"

2 Bring Me Back Lyrics
I think I took too much
Credit card and rolled up dollar bill
On a hotel table
I don't know where they went
I've lost all of my pride
Washed down with another pill
But I've been so complacent
I don't know where them days went


Well I broke my own heart tonight, mama
Now I'm coughing up blood in the sink
And if I take my life don't cry for me, mama
I've spent a while on the brink
I've never felt so cold
I can't feel my heart beating
My lord, bring me back to life
I know I lost my soul
Where's my God when I need him
My lord, bring me back to life


Roll one and light it up
These purple clouds could set the alarm off
Police come and take me
Maybe that would save me
You know I've had my share of drinking, drugs, and women who
Who love you 'cause you're famous
But I guess that I can't blame them

Well I broke my own heart tonight, mama
Now I'm coughing up blood in the sink
And if I take my life don't cry for me, mama
It's been a while on the brink
I've never felt so cold
Can you see my eyes fading?
My lord, bring me back to life
White powder in my nose
Where's my God when I need him? (Help)
My Lord, bring me back to life


For every time that I've been high
And when I made my mom cry
Oh Lord, bring me back to life
For all the women that have been my love
Heartbroken in an instant
My Lord, bring me back to life
For all the friends that I don't see
And the people could think they know me
My Lord, bring me back to life
For all the drugs that I've taken
Sitting in a strangers basement
My Lord, bring me back to life
For all the memories I don't want
'Cause I got nothing to show for
Oh Lord, bring me back to life
And I don't want any of this
And I don't want any of this
I don't want
Oh Lord, bring me back to lifeEmbed

2 Take Me to Church (BBC Live Lounge) Lyrics
My lover's got humor
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week
"We were born sick"
You heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
She tells me "Worship in the bedroom"
The only Heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well


Aaa, Amen, Amen, Amen


Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine looking high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful
That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work


Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human
Only then I am clean


Oh, oh Amen, Amen, Amen


Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my lifeEmbed

4 Shivers (Heavy-K Remix) Lyrics
I took an arrow to the heart
I never kissed a mouth that tastes like yours
Strawberries and a somethin' more
Ooh, yeah, I want it all
Lipstick on my guitar
Fill up the engine, we can drive real far
Go dancin' underneath the stars
Ooh, yeah, I want it all
Mmm, you got me feelin' like


I wanna be that guy, I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile, I wanna feel like I'm
Like my soul's on fire, I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah, you got me singin' like


Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back
And we'll say, "Ooh, I love it when you do it like that"
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back

Into the car
On the backseat in the moonlit dark
Wrap me up between your legs and arms
Ooh, I can't get enough
You know you could tear me apart
Put me back together and take my heart
I never thought that I could love this hard
Ooh, I can't get enough
Mmm, you got me feelin' like


I wanna be that guy, I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile, I wanna feel like I'm
Like my soul's on fire, I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah, you got me singin' like


Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back
And we'll say, "Ooh, I love it when you do it like that"
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back

Baby, you burn so hot, you make me shiver
With the fire you got, this thing we started
I don't want it to stop
You know you make me shiver
Baby, you burn so hot, you make me shiver
With the fire you got, this thing we started
I don't want it to stop
You know you make me shiver
Yeah, you got me singin' like


Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back (Oh, no)
And we'll say, "Ooh, I love it when you do it like that"
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back, heyEmbed
3 Lego House (Subscape Remix) LyricsI'm gonna pick up the pieces
And build a lego house
When things go wrong we can knock it down
My three words have two meanings
There's one thing on my mind
It's all for you
And it's dark in a cold December
But I've got ya to keep me warm
If you're broken I will mend ya and I'll keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm gonna paint you by numbers
And colour you in
If things go right we can frame it
And put you on a wall
And it's so hard to say it but I've been here before
And I'll surrender up my heart
And swap it for yours
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
Don't hold me down
I think my braces are breaking
And it's more than I can take
And it's dark in a cold December
I've got ya to keep me warm
And if you're broke I'll mend ya

1 ContributorBeautiful People (Miles Away & AYMEN Remix) Lyrics:
L.A. on a Saturday night in the summer
Sun down and they all come out
Lamborghinis and their rented Hummers
The party's on, so they're heading downtown
('Round here)

Everybody's looking for a come-up
And they wanna know what you're about
Me in the middle with the one I love and
We're just tryna figure everything out

:
We don't fit in well
'Cause we are just ourselves
I could use some help
Getting out of this conversation, here
You look stunning, dear
So don't ask that question here
This is my only fear
That we become

:
Beautiful people
Drop-top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
"What d'you do?" and "Who d'you know?"
Inside the world of
Beautiful people
Champagne and rolled-up notes
Pre-nups and broken homes
Surrounded, but still alone
Let's leave the party
That's not who we are
(We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful
Yeah, that's not who we are
(We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful



:
Drove for hours last night and we made it nowhere
(Nowhere, nowhere)
I see stars in your eyes when we're halfway there
(All night)
I'm not fazed by all the lights and flashing cameras
'Cause with my arms around you, there's no need to care

:
We don't fit in well
We are just ourselves
I could use some help
Getting out of this conversation here
You look stunning, dear
So don't ask that question here
This is my only fear
That we become

Drop-top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
"What d'you do?" and "Who d'you know?"

Surrounded, but still alone
Let's leave the party

That's not who we are
(We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful (yeah)
Yeah, that's not who we are

2 The Joker And The Queen (Live at the BRIT Awards 2022) Lyrics
How was I to know? It's a crazy thing
I showed you my hand and you still let me win
And who was I to say that this was meant to be?
The road that was broken brought us together


And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that would give you a diamond ring
When I fold, you see the best in me
The joker and the queen


I was upside down from the outside in
You came to the table and you went all in
With a single word and a gentle touch
You turned a moment into forever


And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that could give you a diamond ring
When I fold, you see the best in me
The joker and the queen



And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that would give you a diamond ring
When I folded, you saw the best in me
The joker and the queen
The joker and the queenEmbed
1 omeone Like You (Adele Cover) LyricsI heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you’re married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn’t stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
"Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead"
Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead, yeah

You'd know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn’t stay away, I couldn’t fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you’d be reminded that for me it isn't over, yet

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
"Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead" Yeah

Nothing compares
No worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they’re memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
"Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead"

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
"Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead"
Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead.YeahEmbed
3 Overpass Graffiti (Alle Farben Remix) Lyrics
This is a dark parade
Another rough patch to rain on, to rain on
I know your friends may say
This is a cause for celebration, hip-hip-hooray, love
Photographs in sepia tones
It's so still, the fire's barely fighting the cold alone
There are times when I can feel your ghost
Just when I'm almost letting you go
The cards were stacked against us both


I will always love you for what it's worth
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass
And I know time may change the way you think of us
But I'll remember the way we were, you were the first full stop
Love that will never leave
Baby, you will never be lost on me


This is a goddamn shame
I never wanted to break it or leave us tainted
Know I should walk away
But I just can't replace us or even erase us
The car was stuck, the engine stalled
And both of us got caught out in the snow alone
There were times when I forget the lows
And think the highs were all that we'd ever known
The cards were stacked against us both

I will always love you for what it's worth
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass
And I know time may change the way you think of us
But I'll remember the way we were, you were the first full stop
Love that will never leave
Baby, you will never be lost on me


Lost on me
Baby, you will never be lost on me
Lost on me


Well, I will always love you for what it's worth
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass
And I know time may change the way you think of us
But I'll remember the way we were, you were the first full stop
Love that will never leave
Baby, you will never be lost on me


Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Lost on me
Ooh, graffiti on the overpassEmbed

1 ContributorI Don’t Care (Solo Version) Lyrics
I'm at a party I don't wanna be at
And I don't ever wear a suit and tie, yeah
Wonderin' if I could sneak out the back
Nobody's even lookin' me in my eyes
And then you take my hand
Finish my drink, say, "Shall we dance?" (Hell, yeah)
I fucking love ya, did I ever tell ya?
You make it better like that


Don't think I fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say
I always feel like I'm nobody
Who wants to fit in anyway?


'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
And you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
'Cause I don't care as long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
And you're making me feel like I'm loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm

Look at you glowin' up the dance floor
There ain't nobody that can do it like that
The way your dress holds your frame
The way you know the words to every rap
Can't believe it's true
How I managed to get a woman like you (Hell, yeah)
I don't think I ever told ya
You make it better like that


Don't think I fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say (Yeah)
I always feel like I'm nobody (Mmm)
But now I think that we should stay


'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
And you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
'Cause I don't care as long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere

2 Masters of wars Lyrics(Vers 1)

Come, you masters of war
You that build the big guns
You that build the death planes
You that build all the bombs
You that hide behind walls
You that hide behinds desks
I just want you to know that I can see through your masks

(vers 2)

You that never done nothing
But build to destroy
You that play with my world
Like it's your little toy
Put a gun in my hands
And you hide from my eyes
And you turn and run farther
When the fast bullets fly

(vers 3)

Like Judas of old
You lie and deceive
A war can be won
You want me to believe
But i see through your eyes
And i see trough your brain
Like i see through the water
that runs down my drain
(vers 4)

You that fasten all the triggers
For the others to fight
And you sit back and watch
As the death count gets high
And you hide in your mansion
While the young peoples blood
Flows out of their bodies
and is buried in the mud

(vers 5)

you've thrown the worst fear
It can never be hurled
Fear to bring children
Into the world
For threadning my baby
Unborn and unnamed
Well, you ain't worth the blood
that runs in your veins

(vers 6)

How much do i know
To talk out of turn
You might say that I'm young
You might say that I'm unlearned
But there is one thing i know
Though I'm younger than you
That even Jesus would never forgive
what you do
(vers 7)

Let me ask you one question
Is your money that good
Will it buy you forgiveness
Do you think that it could
I will think that you will find
When your dead takes its toll
All the money you made
will never buy back your soul

(vers 8)

And I hope that you die
And your death will come soon
And I will follow your casket
In the pale afternoon
And I'll watch while you're lowered
Down to your deathbed
And I will stand over your grave
to make sure that you're deadEmbed
2 Happier (Cazzette Remix) Lyrics
Walking down 29th and park
I saw you in another's arm (I saw you in another's arm)
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier
Saw you walk inside a bar
He said something to make you laugh
(He said something to make you laugh)
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah, you look happier, you do


Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're moving on with someone new


Sat in the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself
You're happier, aren't you?


Oh, ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody need you like I do
I know that there's others that deserve you
But my darling, I am still in love with you

But I guess you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I’ll feel it too
I could try to smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Hey yeah, hey yeah


‘Cause baby you look happier, you do
I knew one day you’d fall for someone new
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do
Just know that I’ll be waiting here for youEmbed

1 ContributorChasing Cars (Cover) Lyrics
We'll do it all
Everything
On our own
We don't need
Anything or anyone


If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?


I don't quite know
How to say
How I feel
Those three words
Are said too much
They're not enough


If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's burstin' into life

Let's waste time
Chasing cars
Around our heads
I need your grace
To remind mе
To find my own


If I lay here
If I just lay herе
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's burstin' into life


All that I am
All that I ever was
Is here in your perfect eyes, they're all I can see
I don't know where
Confused about how, as well
Just know that these things will never change for us at all


If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?Embed

And build a Lego house
If things go wrong we can knock it down

Me warm
If you're broken I will mend you and I'll keep you sheltered
From the storm that's raging on now

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you
Better now

I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you

I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you

Don't hold me down
I think my braces are breaking, and it's more than I can
Take

And it's dark in a cold December, but I've got you to keep
Me warm
If you're broken I will mend you and I'll keep you sheltered
From the storm that's raging on now

1 ContributorThe a team - live from zugspitze LyricsWhite lips, pale face
Breathing in snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, day's end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
And sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
Ripped gloves, rain coat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone
And they say
She's in the class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately
Her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
And sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
An angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eyed
And hoping for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
They scream
The worst things in life come to free us
And we're all under the upper hand
Go mad for a couple grams
And we don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe we fly to the Motherland
And sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
To fly, fly
For angels to fly, to fly, to fly
Or angels to dieEmbed

2 Shape Of You V.2 LyricsThe club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox

And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much

Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lеad
Come, come on now, follow my lead
I'm in lovе with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too

I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
One week in we let the story begin

We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat

Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me

Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body

Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
Come on, be my baby, come on

Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on

1 ContributorGuiding light - cover Lyrics
Well the road is wide
Waters run on either side
And my shadow in the fading light
Is stretching out towards the night
When the sun is low
And I have so much more to go
And my lonely heart is beating so
Tired of the wonder
There's a sign ahead
Though I think it's the same one again
So I'm thinking 'bout my only friend
Till I find my way home


Cause when I need to get home
You're my guiding light, you're my guiding light
When I need to get home
You're my guiding light, you're my guiding light


Oh, well the air is cold
And yonder lies my sleeping soul
By the branches broke like bones
This weeping tree no longer holds
Oh well, the night is still
And I have not yet lost my will
Oh, and I will keep on moving 'till
Until I find my way home

When I need to get home
You're my guiding light, you're my guiding light
When I need to get home
You're my guiding light, you're my guiding light

When I need to get home
You're my guiding light, you're my guiding light
When I need to get home
You're my guiding light, you're my guiding light

When I need to get home
You're my guiding light, you're my guiding light
When I need to get home
You're my guiding light, you're my guiding lightEmbed
1 ContributorEyes Closed 
Eu sei que é uma má ideia
Mas como posso me segurar
Estive em casa a maior parte desse ano
E pensei que algumas bebidas poderiam me ajudar
Faz um tempo meu querido
Lidando com as cartas que a vida deu
Ainda estou segurando essas lágrimas
Enquanto meus amigos estão em outro lugar


Eu imaginei esse ano um pouco diferente
Até que chegou fevereiro
Eu pisei no bar, me acertou em chеio
Como pode isso ser tão pesado?
Todas as músicas mе lembram que você se foi
E eu sinto um nó se formando na minha garganta
Porque estou aqui sozinho


Só dançando com os olhos fechados
Porque todo lugar que olho ainda vejo você
E o tempo está passando tão devagar
E eu não sei o que mais posso fazer
Então eu continuo dançando de olhos fechados

A desilusão está aqui de novo
E eu penso que você vai voltar para casa em breve
Uma palavra me traz de volta
Então sou apenas eu que estou neste quarto
Eu acho que poderia apenas fingir
Que as cores são mais que azul
Mas eu perdi mais que meu amigo
Não posso deixar de sentir sua falta


Eu imaginei este mês um pouco diferente
Ninguém está preparado
E quando se desenrola você entra em um buraco
Como isso pode ser tão pesado?
Tudo muda, nada é o mesmo
Exceto a verdade que agora você se foi
E a vida apenas continua


Só dançando com os olhos fechados
Porque todo lugar que olho ainda vejo você
E o tempo está passando tão devagar
E eu não sei o que mais posso fazer
Então eu continuo dançando de olhos fechados

Estão fechando o bar
Estão limpando o chão
E todo mundo já está em casa
Mas estou aqui sozinho


Ainda dançando com os olhos fechados
Porque todo lugar que olho ainda vejo você
E o tempo está passando tão devagar
E eu não sei o que mais posso fazer
Então eu continuo dançando de olhos fechadosEmbed

2 Shape Of You (Remix) Lyrics
Hey
This is the remix
Ed Sheeran, Mohombi


Girl, you must be a dancing queen
Moving that thing like nothing I've seen
You're like the woman in my dreams
That won't let a man ruin your self-esteem
You say you're way too shy to show
Fine, so let's keep this one on the low
I say we chit-chat, then we tiptoe
Out of here, what you say?
'Cause I'm ready to go


Ask me what I want to do
It's so simple, all I want to do is you
I really don't mean to be rude
But it's the truth, girl, all I want to do is you
Can't say I drank too much
'Cause I got sober every single time we touch
I love how you act so tough
Ain't too hard to tell you likе it rough

I'm in love with the shape of you
Wе push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body


Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I (Baby girl)
I'm in love with your body
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I

1 hivers (Tyler Brooker Remix) Lyrics
I took an arrow to the heart
I never kissed a mouth that tastes like yours
Strawberries and then somethin' more
Ooh, yeah, I want it all
Lipstick on my guitar
Fill up the engine, we can drive real far
Go dancin' underneath the stars
Ooh, yeah, I want it all
Mmm, you got me feelin' like


I wanna be that guy, I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile, I wanna feel like I'm
Like my soul's on fire, I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah, you got me singin' like


Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back
And we'll say, "Ooh, I love it when you do it like that"
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back

Into the car
On the backseat in the moonlit dark
Wrap me up between your legs and arms
Ooh, I can't get enough
You know you could tear me apart
Put me back together and take my heart
I never thought that I could love this hard
Ooh, I can't get enough
Mmm, you got me feelin' like


I wanna be that guy, I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile, I wanna feel like I'm
Like my soul's on fire, I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah, you got me singin' like


Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back
And we'll say, "Ooh, I love it when you do it like that"
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right backEmbed
2 Don’t (X Ambassadors Remix) Lyrics
(Ah-lah-m-lah-lah)


I met this girl late last year
She said, "Don't you worry, if I disappear"
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, "I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM"
Baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singing
(Ah-lah-m-lah-lah)


Don't (hhh) with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe (Ah-lah-m-lah-lah)
Don't (hhh) with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
(Ah-lah-m-lah-lah)

And for a couple weeks, I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before, a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But, me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him, how I was confused about
Now she should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing
(Ah-lah-m-lah-lah)


Don't (hhh) with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe (Ah-lah-m-lah-lah)
Don't (hhh) with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

(Knock, knock, knock) On my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course (Ah-lah-m-lah-lah)
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same (hhh) hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different (Ah-lah-m-lah-lah)
This is not the way you realized what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late, if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singing
(Ah-lah-m-lah-lah)


Don't (hhh) with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe (Ah-lah-m-lah-lah)
Don't (hhh) with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe (Ah-lah-m-lah-lah)
Don't (hhh) with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe (Ah-lah-m-lah-lah)
Don't (hhh) with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe (Ah-lah-m-lah-lah)Embed
1 ContributorBad Habits (MANDY Remix) Lyrics
Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful


My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to you


My bad habits lead to you
My bad habits lead to you


My bad habits lead to you
My bad habits lead to you
My bad habits lead to you


My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to you

My bad habits lead to you
My bad habits lead to you


My bad habits lead to you
My bad habits lead to you
My bad habits lead to youEmbed
4 Eyes Closed (Mixed) Lyrics
I pictured this year a little bit different when it hit February
I step in the bar, it hit me so hard, oh, how can it be this heavy?
Every song reminds me you're gone and I feel the lump form in my throat
'Cause I'm here alone


Just dancin' with my eyes closed
'Cause everywhere I look, I still see you
And time is movin' so slow
And I don't know what else that I can do
So I'll keep dancin' with my


Eye-eye-eye-eyes
Eye-eyе-eye-eyеs closed
Eye-eye-eye-eyes
So I'll keep dancin' with my


Delusion is here again
And I think you'll come home soon
A word brings me right back in
Then it's only me that's in this room
I guess I could just pretend
The colours are more than blue
But I lost more than my friend
I can't help but missin' you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

I pictured this month a little bit different, no one is ever ready
And when it unfolds, you get in a hole, oh, how can it be this heavy?
Everything changes, nothing's the same, except the truth is now you're gone
And life just goes on


So I'm dancin' with my eyes closed
'Cause everywhere I look, I still see you
And time is movin' so slow
And I don't know what else that I can do
So I'll keep dancin' with my


Eye-eye-eye-eyes
Eye-eye-eye-eyes closed
Eye-eye-eye-eyes
So I'll keep dancin' with my
Eye-eye-eye-eyes
Eye-eye-eye-eyes closed
Eye-eye-eye-eyes
Oh, I'll keep dancin' with myEmbed
