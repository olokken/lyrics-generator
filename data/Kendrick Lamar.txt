[Angela McCluskey (Kendrick Lamar):]
Sit still and close your eyes (smoke to it)
What's behind the other door? Oh-ohh
No more silence (no more silence)
Don't kill this thing we got called love (don't shoot)
Just searching for the perfect shot

[Angela McCluskey:]
When love comes calling, don't look back
When love comes calling, don't look away
When love comes calling, don't look back
When love comes calling, don't look away

[Kendrick Lamar (Angela McCluskey):]
I used to write rhymes all day and all night
When y'all was playing PlayStation, my pencil was erasing lines
My conscience only knew what's half-tight
At 3:14, it's time to get me a slice my nigga
This is a dog's fight my nigga
The soundtrack to life my nigga
Kendrick Lamar, his momma called him that
He watched House Party and ate Apple Jacks
Sold Sega games, his cousin sold crack
He pumped Reeboks, his uncles pumped packs
Pump fake, jump-shot, ball hit the back
Board dreams of being point guard was off limits Jack
That's because these Compton streets was built not to win
You killed the nigga, I stole a bible, is that a sin?
Pardon me though, I'm searching for answers (just searching for the perfect shot)
The good kid from the ugly city, he's mad that he's handsome
Where is the love?

[Angela McCluskey (Kendrick Lamar):]
When love comes calling, don't look back
When love comes calling, don't look away (where is the love?)
When love comes calling, don't look back
When love comes calling, don't look away

[Kendrick Lamar (Angela McCluskey):]
Give me rings, give me chains mane
Give me a blue Benz, red Porsche, red Range
Give me black bitches, white hoes, new clothes
A mansion with marble floors and security codes
Then give me some landa, or maybe I'll land a
G5, clear port, say hello to the man
Give me awards, Grammies, and let the crowd applaud
My name 'til they strain the veins and their vocal cords
Give me fame and fortune, me and Trump on golf courses
With that being said, give me Tiger's sports endorsements
Give me billboards, whatever that people will kill for
Manhattan and 40/40, no forties but Rose poured
Give me vanity, give me Kurt Cobain sanity
Give me a city where Channel 7 newscasters' cameras be
Give me horror like Amity, no, give me the charts (just searching for the perfect shot)
And if you ever renege, I'll still give you Kendrick Lamar
This is me, and that's love

[Angela McCluskey:]
When love comes calling, don't look back
When love comes calling, don't look away
When love comes calling, don't look back
When love comes calling, don't look away

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Now everybody smoke to it
For this is, the celebration


For the record, I used to do a lot of humping when I was little
I got a lot of whoopings over that shit too, and that's random, but so what? Ha-ha-ha

Gimme that beat, fool
This a full time jack, no really this a Soundwave track
So really I ain't gotta steal nothing all I gotta do is kill it when you press record button let the paralyzed feel it
I came back with a full time swag and the critics thought they had me
Nah, I just bought more batteries
Turned up supercharged, a medium away from livin' large
Matter fact, where my niggas at?
Where my bitches with them pretty weaves?
Enemies bleed on the maxi pad, pussy you fucked with the wrong one I'm on one I'll make sure your kids breathe pneumonia
Good kid, mad city evil in my heart from the blood niggas fuckin' with me crip niggas tryna kill me
Malcolm X mind state, if I raise the crime rate, it's a legitimate reason why I put on repeat Kanye's "Touch The Sky"
But I'll be looking past that I'm tryna touch God
My heart to the heavens, the rebel of the reverend
Ya'll married to the game well I'm 'bout to crash weddings
I put a lot of pain in the shit I write
If you goin' through something, this is shit you recite
This is bigger than life
This is Kendrick Lamar
This is Jimi Hendrix guitar on tour, bonjour I mean war like that
Yeah, straight like that

People don't be shy
Release them balloons to the sky
I need the world to celebrate me! (One time)
You'll never know when I'm gone (Two times)

In 2010 I'm tryna ball, nigga!
Like shooting jumpshots in the mall, nigga!
That's a quote from Ab-Soul I suppose since you laugh that's the ultimate goal
On behalf of the Top Dawg conglomerate
Shall stay anonymous
Searchin' seven continents accomplishing big shit
Big ass, big tits she on me
And just to get to me she'll fuck the homies-homie's homies
The life of a cool nigga
My nigga Tony said "just do you, nigga!"
Sure improve, nigga
And they gon' play you for a fool that's for sure 'til they know you got the stinkiest stool, nigga!
I ain't trippin' I'm just tippin' on fo-fo's back in the city and tippin' on four hoes
That boy got a cold cold
He's sick con, slick on
Drop red jewels like a school bar mitzvah
Ooh
Straight like that

People don't be shy
Release them balloons to the sky
I need the world to celebrate me! (One time)
You'll never know when I'm gone (Two times)

Why ya'll complain about OGs?
I don't look at a legend and say you owe me
Not Snoop not Dre not Ice Cube
I don't care me and Quik went to the same school
I look in the mirror and do it myself like a self made nigga
I don't need a maid, nigga
Do I need a co-sign from Dre or Jigga?
They can make me much bigger, but do I need 'em though?
I just need a flow
The type of shit that make you think you seen Pac ghost "Me Against The World" on you motherfuckers
I got my back against the wall and a .45, dog get smoked, Chris Tucker
Uh, tryna record my steelo
Even when I'm not there just like TiVo
The hoes tell me that I got a real big ego
And weed move slow right now but E go
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
I look at your Audemars to put ya'll in time out
It's time to unveil the real and your career's 'bout as frail as Ms. Winehouse
Just salute, grab a flute and pull the wine out
Ooh, just like that

People don't be shy
Release them balloons to the sky
I need the world to celebrate me! (One time)
You'll never know when I'm gone (Two times)


Oh what up, ho? Oh, what up?
I said oh, what up, ho? Oh, what up?
I said oh, what up, ho? Oh, what up?
Well, alright

[Kendrick Lamar:]
I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice
I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice

Welcome to my diary, stressing got me gray hairs
Something to inspire me, rather than society's
Woes, let me go, let me shine a lil' bit love
I want diamonds too, Ronnie on Player's Club
I used to have a 9 to 5, fresh out of school that was '05
That bitch was racist, got me fired, ever since then I had no job
Pushing in my mama van, stop for gas on Rosecrans
Trust me these niggas rushed me for something my cousin probably did
Guilty by association story of my life, nigga
You gone make me flip then split your shit, judge give me life, nigga
Pain since my grandma's death, uncle killed at Louis's Burgers
Hold my tears I tried my best, let it go drench my pullover
Cycles of a starving artist tryna go beyond the margin's margin
Maintaining my modest, modest as I dream
So while I go through all this, all this bullshit what you call it
Life itself I know it helps let me scroll through my Blackberry

Hey, what's up, daddy?
I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice
I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice

I said keep reading my diary, when my life's entirely
Surrounded by the irony of living in the city
I said they wouldn't hire me, I said I got my ass beat
And the only thing can help is ass and some titties

So what's up, baby? I said what's up?
I had a long day and I really wanna fuck

See I ain't tryna think about no phone bills
Credit card late fees, Capital One popping up on my caller ID
Pawning my chain in the shop, watching for hollow-tip shots
Watching my vehicle break down on another man's block
Man that's my worst fear, ain't that your worst fear

You know when your transmission go out and can't switch gears
Or run through a pothole at two in the morning
Scared to hit your emergencies 'cause then they'll be on it
See I know when the harsh reality take its toll
Open up your contacts then scroll

Hey, what's up daddy
I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice
I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice

[Ab-Soul:]
Welcome to my diary. Hmm, where should I begin?
Finna get a Swisher and fill it with at least a gram
Crackers watch my every step, better yet they work my every nerve
Cutting me this worthless check, the concept is so absurd
Like a church in debt, a turtle in a turtle neck
Convertibles with turbojets, fueled by 7-Up and prometh'
I feel like deaths around the corner like the quickest wide receiver
So I took another shot, Tequila hit me like a nina
My sky's gray, my bitches brighter
Always saying lights please, J. Cole's her ghost writer

And I'm the God MC, join my diocese
Free your mind, don't mind society
And finally, everyone got their own problems
Everything is subject to change like broken dollars
I'ma drown in my drink and swim in my woman's vagina
Like a piranha fin, it gets harder than Rihanna when

[Kendrick Lamar:]
I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice
I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice


One time, reporting live, Compton, California

[Kendrick Lamar:]
She go to work, she go to school, her body smooth, no tattoos
Type of girl that'll make your mother feel comfortable
My pops love her too, she's compatible, she's independent
She handle her business, she believe in God and no other religions
She's never in competition, when it comes to her friends, she's dependable
She set her own trends, a confidant, a mediator, so sweet, every flavor
Just a conversation with her doing you a favor, look at her hips, I want to be her pager
Conservative, affirmative, actually she relaxing in sweats and bobby pins
The beauty of her, a blind man can see, a true queen and she needs me
She needs me, she needs me, she needs me, she needs me
The beauty of her, swear to God, a blind man can see, a true queen and she needs me

[JaVonté:]
That girl is smoking, and can you believe that I'm her focus?
It ain't hard to see she got me open, and together we are roller-coasting on

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Five years later, an accounting major, work at a firm
Abundance of paper, she got a career, she look in the rear
View mirror of a Mercedes that she can steer
Call her boss, executive meetings, consecutive trips, vacational weekends
Dior reeking through her Prada dress, probably the only product of her pure success
Got a promotion, now she own the building
Headed to the top like she on the building, real estate, property
She order tender steak, only one mouth to feed, funded a youth center
Invested in some stock, doubled what she put in, then bought a restaurant
Oh what a girl, how great life can be, even though she got the world, she needs me
She needs me, she needs me, she needs me, she needs me
Oh what a girl, wonder how her life can be, and though she got the world, she needs me

[JaVonté:]
That girl is smoking, and can you believe that I'm her focus?
It ain't hard to see she got me open, and together we are roller-coasting on

[Kendrick Lamar:]
We lose touch, separated, years pass, I'm outdated
She's dating one of Hollywood's famous entertainers, Denzel good
Paparazzi spot 'em out shopping, Tuesday morning brunch, Benihana's
Tabloids paint a picture of a perfect couple
Headline reads when a famous actor loves you, Emmy Awards, Academy too
On the red carpet, dress matching his suit, she holding his arm
She waves at her moms and wave at the world, got the world in her palms
Head in the clouds, star gazing, caught her on the stage, a proposal was waiting
He bent down, got on one knee, she looked him in the eye and said she needs me
She needs me, she needs me, she needs me, she needs me
Even if we seem to separate, eventually it'll come to pass, and she'll need me
I need her, we need we

[JaVonté:]
That girl is smoking, and can you believe that I'm her focus?
It ain't hard to see she got me open, and together we are roller-coasting on


See y'all don't understand me
My plan B is to win ya hearts before I win a Grammy
Kendrick Lamar, words like a sword in the hands of a Spartan
Marching on Rosecrans in Compton
You can't 'cause conflict or corrupt my spirit
I'm on point like period
I've been there and gone before you get near it
Ooh wee, that boy remind me of a young Martin Luther
The way he piece up troopers, then round up shooters
Like Malcolm X did, I stand for what I believe in
Family, God and honor
From Chicago, my daddy and my mamma
Came to Compton to accomplish one thing
Raise a king, reign supreme, named Kendrick
I ain't lying, it stand for king and I am one
My unborn son and grandson will live royal
From the coochie to the soil
The meek shall inherit the Earth
Well I've had this world since birth
Feel the good kid's hunger
The Crips made strong, the Pirus made stronger
Muscle in my heart
Stare at the eyes of Mozart, then tell him I'm the genius
Do my dougie and grab my penis
'Cause I means this with all my soul
And you can't control greatness 'less you hating with the heart of Satan
But even that can't stop it
Nigga, get out my wallet and put passion in your logic
Passion in your life, the passion of my Christ is in me
And if you say it ain't, you may offend me
Damn that boy good
Bright as Thomas Edison, but Gucci man hood
He stood alone for so long
Prolonged his whole career, but now he's here
You can shoot shots or cheer 'cause I... am


It's like I don't think you fully understand who I am, ya know?
I'm just a good kid from Compton that wanna rap
I don't represent no colors, I represent my lil' sisters and brothers
I'm the oldest, nigga
And if you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack
Check it out

I used to wanna rap like JAY-Z
Until I finally realized that Jay wasn't me
I took my time to jot down every line that's a quotable
Critics say I don't be killing this shit but I know I do
Because I used to practice early morning and then after school
I'm working on my hooks my nigga, I ain't tryna battle you
But even if I did, I guarantee I'd overshadow you
Like a fucked up taper that turned to bowl cut
I'mma close cut to Common and Gucci Mane
Now that's a comparison that you probably wouldn't understand
Because I can touch the people and still keep it ghetto
As an '87 Regal with the tree air freshener on the rear-view mirror
I wear a heart on my shoulder
'Member when we used to make the boost look like Motorola?
Your cousin fucked up your room every time he came over
Then went to jail when we got older
That shit is a bad odor, but still I remain focused
In due time, I'll be able to swipe my card and it won't say decline
That shit's embarrassing huh
Hope no one pay you no mind
But it's a bad bitch behind you while you standing in line
Can you relate to my story? Can you follow my dreams
And admirations that I had ever since I was thirteen?
My mamma believed in me, she let me use her van to go to the studio
Even though she know her tank is empty, that's who I do it for
My pops got a different approach, yeah he believed
But he always questioned when I'mma drop my debut CD
How long this gon' take nigga? You still haven't ate nigga
At twenty-two I had two cars and my own place nigga
It's a sacrifice I try to tell him
That's when he turn to BET and tell me that he jealous
Of all these niggas getting money and their shit don't sound like shit
I ain't tryna kill your confidence or forcing you to quit
I just wanna hear you heard

Yep, yep, that's my word
Make a statement with these nouns and verbs
I represent the liquor that's poured out on the curb
Listen to my nouns and verbs (Man, I wanna be heard)
Like a cattle with sheep
While y'all sleep I be up, cooking up all day
Like a mad scientist in that laboratory
Motherfuck what a critic got to say, I'ma be heard

What up DZYNE? I ain't forgot nigga
You developed me, telling me I was hot nigga
You believed in me first, that's what's for sure
At the church recording, at the garage, but it worked
But me and Dave kind of felt you lost the passion
A lot was going on in your life and you needed space
But still I should have came to you first to tell you what happened
But I was seventeen and figured it's best I stay away
And I was wrong, I was young and couldn't look you in the eye for what I'd done
But I'm telling you we ain't done
Matter of fact, how's your sons? What they up to?
Remember they used to run away while you had worked on ProTools?
People I used to be in the booth 'til four in the morning
With school in the morning, yawning, but I was on it
Me, you and Dave was on it
Buzzing like Charlotte Hornets when that tape dropped
Where them beats nigga? It's been five years since we had rocked
Time to be heard

Yep, yep, that's my word
Make a statement with these nouns and verbs
I represent the liquor that's poured out on the curb
Listen to my nouns and verbs (Man, I wanna be heard)
Like a cattle with sheep
While y'all sleep I be up, cooking up all day
Like a mad scientist in that laboratory
Motherfuck what a critic got to say, I'ma be heard

So can you feel it?
When you hear it do it pulsate your spirit?
Do it make you wanna say motherfuck a gimmick?
The truth can set you free if you Do the Right Thing
Word to Spike Lee, don't he look like Sounwave?
That's kinda random, but my humor sometimes strays
Like a dog in the night
Twenty-four hours in a day but only take five minutes
To grab a pad and a pen, then send your dog a kite
I spread love like a hippy, but I'm a black one
With Jesus Christ passion, I swear on the bible
Tabernacle to all my rivals, I ain't mad
You hate a nigga for tryna help you, that's your bad
Because I figure I can make a way with these stanzas
I probably can't heal cancer, but I can heal the city
My niggas, tell me you with me
And if you is won't you pop my CD in
Open up your trunk, then let it bump, so I can be heard
Yeah, uh huh

Yep, yep, that's my word
Make a statement with these nouns and verbs
I represent the liquor that's poured out on the curb
Listen to my nouns and verbs (Man, I wanna be heard)
Like a cattle with sheep
While y'all sleep I be up, cooking up all day
Like a mad scientist in that laboratory
Motherfuck what a critic got to say, I'ma be heard

D-Dave, what up nigga?
Matt Jeezy, ha ha ha


[Kendrick Lamar:]
The homies say I'm the truest
The bitches think I'm the cutest
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this!

Uh, I used to wanna be like Michael Jordan
Figured that I hit the NBA and make a fortune
Thank God for these rap recordings
I can ball like him on every verse and chorus
501s, Louis Letterman jacket
Little brother only 5, mamma put him on my taxes
You know that Compton ghetto shit
That every section 8 tenant is familiar with
Ooh wee, they say he something like the 70s
But I'm from '87, with a thousand dimes
You got 80 sevens
Gourmet sneakers, hair nappy
Fucking all my high school teachers
That was '05 bro
And I don't like 'em if the ass thin
And I don't wife 'em if a nigga is her best friend
The fuck I look like?
A million bucks, and that's why

The homies say I'm the truest
The bitches think I'm the cutest
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this!
Bitch, I do this!
Bitch, I do this!
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this

She looking at the car like she wanna fuck it
She looking at the wrist like she wanna fuck it
Hating on her girlfriend just so I can fuck it
She say she on birth control, no I don't trust it (Ho)
Uh, so give me fifty-feet champ
Run until I got a bunion and my feet cramp
I'm in the hot spot, I know their seats damp
And I don't need your cosign, that's a cheap stamp
You-you niggas check this cash and I'm GT-crashing
105 off-ramp, hey
And little nigga got it going on, G5
Going, going, going, gone
Cloud-9 mind state
I drop a record then I raise the crime rate
Killing this shit, where's your funeral tie?
A-B-C-D-E-F-G, fuck skip to Y

The homies say I'm the truest
The bitches think I'm the cutest
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this!
Bitch, I do this!
Bitch, I do this!
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this

[Jay Rock:]
She looking at the car like she wanna fuck it
She looking at the wrist like she wanna fuck it
Hating on her girlfriend just so I can fuck it
She say she on birth control, no I don't trust it
First off I'm a rider, bitch
Put them 26s on a Silverado, bitch
I keep my bitch with a finer bitch
Snap my fingers, she'll go find a bitch
Tell them fuck boys that I do this
Got the best product 'round town, Frank Lucas
Confuse 'em like a Rubik's Cube when I roll up
OK, "Subway" bread like some cold cuts
And I drop cold cuts, bitches go crazy
Wild like a Haitian, I should set up shop in Haiti
Fuck you, pay me. Paper over pussy, nigga
When I drop you ain't getting paper nor pussy, nigga

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Bitch, I do this
Bitch, I do this
The definition of cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this


[Kendrick Lamar:]
I was sitting on the couch reading yellow paper
A letter in reply, 7 days later after I wrote 'em
"Stay strong, keep your faith in God," what I told him
Hoping that he's listening
Said that they tried to give him like a hundred years
What a coincidence, I was bumping some Plies
I can taste the salt from my tears
As the water had start to flood on my eyes
I know it gotta be hard being 21
Doing time in the pen and your Gram's old
Your brother's getting older
And the streets is getting colder
And your hoping that he's focused to stay on the right road
Sleeping in a cell, it's been 30 weeks
Ain't received any mail
It's cold and the hole stinks
And you can't even blink without niggas testing your life
As I read every word that you write, I can only imagine
Jason Keaton, I can only imagine

[Javonte:]
Life's about decisions man
It's in your hand and you got it
Just take control if you can
It's in your hand and you got it

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Sitting on the couch, that was my Uncle Bobby
After he just got out, 15 years to count
Haven't seen the world in so long
Haven't seen a girl in so long
And before the sun came up, he was gone
Like a fiend off the best rock
Trying to get his life together, or what not
Typed his name in the system and they couldn't find his identity
Got it straight, got a place, found some serenity
Found a job, found his mother's grave site, found a 40 ounce
Then he found God, then he bounced, then he found a new chick
Two kids, wide hips, found something in her we didn't see
Found this spot in Pasadena and shack with her, an investment
Then found guilty, somebody had yelled domestic
Violence on my Uncle, was working with two strikes
Only out a year, now facing life
I can only imagine
That's fucked up
I can only imagine, Uncle Bob

[Javonte:]
Life's about decisions man
It's in your hand and you got it
Just take control if you can
It's in your hand and you got it

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Sitting on the couch, thinking about the ratio
Of blacks in prison as compact in prison
When blacks pack with minorities
System grab more of these 18-year-olds
18-year sentence with no parole
The state won't oversee
They make the term severe, a conspiracy?
That's what I call it, it's full of shit
A toilet can help quick, the government help?
No, just put us on death row
Just give us some more guns, then give us some more coke
Then give us another chair, then give us some more rope
Then hang it like right there, yeah
It's justice for all but 90 percent unfair
Care? No
Alcatraz was purchased by a white man
For 5 grand, with intentions to expand
More prisons
So these correctionals ain't for rehabilitation
They for grossing a bigger business
Imagine
We're being used
Imagine
The truth shall be told

[Javonte:]
Life's about decisions man
It's in your hand and you got it
Just take control if you can
It's in your hand and you got it


[Kendrick Lamar:]
Cloud nine, Kendrick Lamar, uh
I take a sip of Hennessy and then get pissy drunk
I ain't a drinker, I'm a thinker, call it what you want
But if you turn your back, know that you just missed your chance
To witness the realest shit that's ever been told to man
I found myself losing focus at a Sunday service
Embarrassed so I start questioning God, "What is my purpose?"
He said to live the way he did, that's all he want from me
Spread the word and witness, he rose on the first Sunday
I said alright, enthused that my Lord gave a listen
I opened my Bible in search to be a better Christian
And this from a person that never believed in religion
But shit, my life is so fucked up, man; I can't help but give in
I'm giving testimonies to strangers I never met
Hopped on the pulpit and told them how I was truly blessed
Felt like I'm free from all my sins when the service was over
Walked out the church, then got a call that my homie was murdered
Then lost my faith again

[BJ The Chicago Kid:]
What am I gonna do?
Gotta have faith
Life is too much
I'm just through
Where is your faith?
(Don't you give up don't you give in...)
Faith
All you need is the size of a mustard seed

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Single black parent from Compton raising children of four
That's four innocent bastards 'cause, papa, they don't know
Her day consists of working back and forth with babysitters
Can't find no one to watch her kids, so she pay her sister
Her baby daddy ain't 'bout shit, that nigga ain't 'bout shit
Spilt his daughter milk just to cop a new outfit
She pray to God every night, hoping that he'll mature
And maybe one day his kids something that he'll live for
Baby wanna go back to school, but she need some help
Because it's hard tryna pay the bills when you're by yourself
She thought about credit card scams, 'til she heard a voice
That said, "The Devil is a lie, make a better choice."
And so it's back to McDonald's and every month dealing
With them crazy ass people at the county building
Looked to the heavens and aksed Him to make a better way
Then got a letter in the mail, lost her Section 8
Then lost her faith again

[BJ The Chicago Kid:]
What am I gonna do?
Gotta have faith
Life is too much
I'm just through
Where is your faith?
(Don't you give up, don't you give in...)
Faith
All you need is the size of a mustard seed

[Punch:]
Kendrick, I appreciate the opportunity to vent my nigga
This about how faith works, yeah, murk it
I had dreams of holding a 9 milla to Ray's killa
Ask him why as my eyes fill up
Each day it gets more realer, orangutans bang like gorillas
It's jungle when the niggas in zoo
The rats lurking, vultures circling the serpents
Cats lying through their teeth, my nigga didn't deserve it
I flirted with the idea of caressing the steel
To make karma come faster than she normally will
It's ill to see my faith try and leave me
It's so hard to get it, to get rid of it is easy
I'm tryna reach Cloud 9, that's what my niggas 'bout
But it never rain in California 'less them pistols out
Until then, my feet planted on the ground
Shadowboxing my conscience 'til my faith start responding
And if I get no answer, just know I tried
I should have never looked into his son's eyes
Ray Charles voice

[BJ The Chicago Kid:]
What am I gonna do?
Gotta have faith
Life is too much
I'm just through
Where is your faith?
(Don't you give up, don't you give in...)
Faith
All you need is the size of a mustard seed

[Kendrick Lamar:]
This for my people that stressing whenever times is hard
Your mind's slipping, wondering, "Is there really a god?"
Knowing you shouldn't think that way and tryna freeze your brain
But whenever there's pain, that feeling forever remains
We can't believe what we can't see and reality seems stronger than prayer
'Cause you tried to change your life, and now you live in a wheelchair
And your son was born with cancer and he live in urgent care
At the tender age of 12, and you feel that no one cares
Searching for answers, that's human nature, you ain't in the wrong
Just know when you feeling that way His Spirit's in the room
I watched people I know pray and catch the Holy Ghost
And wonder why I ain't ever caught that feeling before
Maybe they know Him better, or I don't know no better
But what I do know, is that He's real and He lives forever
So the next time you feel like your world's about to end
I hope you studied because He's testing your faith again

I'd rather not live like there isn't a God
Than die and find out there really is
Think about it


"Boarding completed
I'd like to welcome you aboard flight number F2B3
Our scheduled flying time will be four hours and twenty minutes
And we will be cruising at an altitude of thirty-three-thousand feet
At this time we would like to acquaint you with some of the features
Relax and breathe normally"

Uh, coming down like I'm uphill
Hogging both lanes better than a bus will
She tell me that my head bigger than a bus wheel
But it don't matter 'cause she still gon' let me fuck still
I mix a little bit of Kendrick with some L.A. weather
Then step out like Chicago in its finest era
You niggas begging for attention, doing extra-extra
Downgrading yourself, you get an F for effort
Ha-ha, I let the world know
I chose to keep to myself and let the world go
And if you don't like a nigga, then let your girl know
So she can be curious on Twitter looking me up
I'm laid back with a bad one, you ain't never had one
Ass so fat that it tipped over the Aston
Speeding on the 1-0-5 'til the fucking badge come
Hello to my wittiness, I'm Cadillac's grandson

And I'm a trip
Ever since an understudy man I've always been a trip
Mama tell me that she love me but she know her son a trip
Baby open up your ears, you ain't heard it like this
Sounwave drop the beat, I lock the flow down
Now all the way to the moon we 'bout to go now
I got enough of the mojo to go around
So pack your bags and tell him you going out of town
'Cause I'm a trip

Landing on another runway, fly with me
Or die tryna fly, a shot-down Frisbee
Shout out to Black Hippy, nigga we on
Like we never been off, straight shots of Patron
I'm give y'all the business to give y'all some business
Pussy ain't shit, I can give y'all some bitches
Clean off her sports bra, she clean off my dishes
Then wear off the Kangols, hood rats, I hate those
And she know what this is, hey lil' mama
Seen your pretty ass around the way lil' mama
But why you always in somebody face lil' mama?
Embarrassing yourself, get off the stage (Lil Mama)
Nigga, I gotta be that nigga
If I ain't, I gotta beat that nigga
Courtesy of Paula's oldest son, pay homage
Or pay attention, open your eyes and hear knowledge

And I'm a trip
Ever since an understudy man I've always been a trip
Mama tell me that she love me but she know her son a trip
Baby open up your ears, you ain't heard it like this
Sounwave drop the beat, I lock the flow down
Now all the way to the moon we 'bout to go now
I got enough of the mojo to go around
So pack your bags and tell him you going out of town
'Cause I'm a trip

Gi-give me that, gi-gi-give me that
That's how I get at 'em when I look at a shoe rack
Penny for thoughts, mine start at a few racks
So I can live on a hill just off a few raps
I want to live in a space that none of y'all can visit
That might be outer space, the Jupiter district
I quadruple my vision
If you don't see it then you're dead with your eyes open
I've seen bullets hit the wheel, left his ride smoking
On some Compton shit
Somebody that'll ride or die, that's a Compton bitch
You see my city is the city of Lamar
It'll take twenty years 'fore a nigga see them all
The swap meet dumping, the sawed-off pumping
The tree for the low, don't you know, Paul Bunyan
I'm on cloud nine, I can see rain coming
So if I'm out my mind, people don't say nothing

And I'm a trip
Ever since an understudy man I've always been a trip
Mama tell me that she love me but she know her son a trip
Baby open up your ears, you ain't heard it like this
Sounwave drop the beat, I lock the flow down
Now all the way to the moon we 'bout to go now
I got enough of the mojo to go around
So pack your bags and tell him you going out of town
'Cause I'm a trip

"How was your flight Mr. Lamar?
Good. Hope to see you next time"


Uh-uh-uh, what up?
Uh, I'm tryna, what up?
Uh-uh, I'm tryna get something
Uh-uh-uh, I'm tryna, what up?
I say, what up?
Uh-uh, I'm tryna

Sometimes I wanna leave, sometimes I wanna cry
Sometimes I hate to bear the truth, sometimes I wanna lie
Sometimes I wanna school the youth, sometimes I wanna ride
Sometimes I wanna not think, sometimes I wanna vibe
Sometimes I wanna bump Tribe and zone out, this song's 'bout a young boy
That's going wild inside, when my world collide
With your world where your girl and your kids reside
We kill the facades, we feel free to fly
We're birds that reserve in the charismatic sky
I care about my pride too much, if my clothes is new
If my ride is plush, if my hair is cut, if my diamonds is crushed
I look in the mirror, I'm trendy enough? Wrong
Insecurity roams the black community
Homes where kids must have jewelry
The high school female need earrings and details
So she can be cool to be amongst popularity
The various name brands that reached the price scan
It's not about the right price, but more like the right scam
To rule us all, confuse us all
Hit the bank within five minutes and then withdraw
Now let's draw the picture of a rapper with a chain
And a Range that is not paid for
My cousin from the South said he just bought him a house
That lives around his neck like a white collar
So why fast forward? Then I rewind
A time machine can help me double back to slavery times
Picking cotton from a field that a white man own
The blacker you are, farther you're from the white man's home
Negro spiritual songs gave us some type of sanity
Before your vanity they parted our families
They put us in hundred-degree shade, and outside we bathed
The more we were afraid, the more they made rules
And trapped our minds in a cage, our freedom was so vague
Couldn't see it with the eyes of Tracee Ross, uh!
And school was exempt, see we couldn't have smarts
And a smirk could get you hurt, wounded first from a scar
Four-hundred years of nothing, four-hundred years of suffering
Four-hundred years of tears and tribulation, miseducation
See what we facing is now coming back to the roots
Remember whips on our back and if we would run they would shoot?
Call us niggers and figured that we never live in pursuit
Of happiness, we're capturing these feelings in things that we do
Thought it's abstinence in slavery, but we made it come to
A modern perspective, my shoe selection gotta be Louie
Her handbag gotta be Gucci, it's fake then she fool me
She still bad though, and her fake Gucci ain't that bad though
We filling up the gas for Rollies
Upgrade to twenty-sixes after riding Kobes
My cousin from the South, slavery start in the South and I bet ya
He overcompensates for the life of his ancestors
So blame it on the four-hundred years we never saw
The reason why the next four-hundred we gotta floss
Slaves

Uh, I said the four-hundred years we never had nothing
Barely had clothes on our back
It's the reason why when we get a little bit of change
We over-exaggerate on our living expenses
So if you get your first big check and you cop a chain before you buy a house
You're a vanity slave
If you're a female and you got four, five, six rings on your finger
Four holes in your left ear and a nose piercing
You're a vanity slave
If you got an '02 Monte Carlo with twenty-fours on it
And on the back of the window it says "Get on my level, hoe."
You're a vanity slave
We're all vanity slaves
And with that being said, can somebody please tell me where the mall at?
I'm not from around here
Hey Ali, where we at? Idaho?
Yeah nigga, you know the first of the month
Let them checks coming nigga
I'm tryna get some, but what up?


[Kendrick Lamar:]
A nigga so goddamn stressed out
I feel like fuck everything right now
See I've been broke too long, can't find a job to save my life
But I'll be damned if I give 'em my handout
See my pride is one thing I will not put aside
I'm too proud to beg, I'm sorry Left Eye
If I don't make it in life, motherfucker I tried
What? Uh

You ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?
Not your mamma, your poppa, only person is you
Not your brother, your sister, the only person is you
You ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?
Nobody, nobody but you
So it feels like, like it's only you

So I'm feeling like I want to, I want to
I want to, I want to go so far from here
Very, very far from here
I need to, I need to
I need to, I need to go so far from here
Very, very far from here

It seems like, you can't win for losing
Whatever you're doing turns out to be "what-are-you-doing?"
Sick of pursuing, that your time will soon come
Nobody knows the position that you in
But it's a million people out there that's going through the same thing
That feeling, hard to explain
When you just, just want to get away
Something like

You ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?
Not your mamma, your poppa, only person is you
Not your brother, your sister, the only person is you
You ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?
Nobody, nobody but you
So it feels like, like it's only you

So I'm feeling like I want to, I want to
I want to, I want to go so far from here
Very, very far from here
I need to, I need to
I need to, I need to go so far from here
Very, very far from here

[Schoolboy Q:]
Away from it all
Take me out of Hell where only Heaven can visit
The smartest astronomers, they won't even see my vision
I'm stuck on the studio couch, now thinking 'bout my daughter
Times is getting harder, another beat is slaughtered
Just press record or, seems like I need a mill' to keep my shit in order
Instead of problem solving
From my hat to my shoes, spirit laced with pride
Set some shit aside to help me wipe my teary eyes
Reaching for the skies, pissing on a cloud
Shitting on a bird's head, higher than a dread
As I fly through the galaxy, pain and the agony
Nothingness surrounding me, living my life
Though it's better to write
Configuring my style to the streets, bring dark to the light
So how you feel? My nigga, I keep it real
A Schoolboy soon to be star, Mr. Lamar

[Kendrick Lamar:]
So I'm feeling like I want to, I want to
I want to, I want to go so far from here
Very, very far from here
I need to, I need to
I need to, I need to go so far from here
Very, very far from here


Reporting live from Compton, California
North Cackalack

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Now everybody just bow to the greatness, or die in the matrix
You're hereby dating, my destiny's waiting
My itinerary is very hectic
I break records on every record, I'm truly reckless
Kendrick Lamar, no Audemar on my wrist
It's arthritis from holding it down bitch
Me and my down bitch, get busy
I'm busy taking over, the world
With the weight of the world on my shoulder
My drive is not to be chauffeured
I'm live, come to the harvest, welcome the artist
Whose lyrics out of the orbit, more than the hardest rapper
To hit the market and market myself as a shooting target
With offers that got me up in these offices often
Boo-yaa, who ya? No one, I've done situated myself, I ain't lying
Be sure to be friend 'cause my foes die five times
The good kid from the mad city
Holding a cereal box instead of a Glock
In a 1992 Cadillac that I got from my pops
Transmission slipping, but I ain't tripping, swallow my pride
Pop in my tape and roll the window, down
Like Stacie homie when airing out endo
I wish a nigga would

A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
Kendrick, show these muh'fuckers how we rock
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
Big Pooh, show these muh'fuckers how we rock

[Rapper Big Pooh:]
Yo, it's evident, I'm evidently your favorite
All I ask, open your ears and please savor it
The taste is un-acquired, quietly, been inspired
I'm at a point in my life when I was getting tired
Now I'm brushing off the dust
We don't need no water, fire burned it to the dust
Nigga grind hard, roaches turning into musk
People hear his pain, I consider that a plus
I'm a grown man, so a few I have trust to Do the Right Thing
The Spike thing, consider me the in-between
The new regime taking over
Either we each other's opposition or you soldier
Used to have the whole state of NC on my shoulder then I passed it
Off to the next, you unlucky bastard
I'm getting drunk same time every year
To celebrate the life, Rosie no longer here
I swear

A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
Kendrick, show these muh'fuckers how we rock
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
Big Pooh, show these muh'fuckers how we rock

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Me and Big Pooh like the definition of a two-man city zoo
Even Zeus can get beat up from punchlines
When I kick it and pump mine, I've got to be a prophet
I've gotta make a profit big enough to have a thirty pound wallet
I'm a Hub City representer, so I've got to represent the
City like a District Attorney beatin' the case for killers
Might walk around in gurney, this is my sickest winter
Since I had the flu and flew in the hospital with the shivers

[Rapper Big Pooh:]
U-P-S, I deliver
Little brown boy get the pick of the litter
No glitter, all guts, no glory
Station on repeat, they retread the same story
New niggas bore me, tryna progress to that old shit
Have a plate, that food for your soul tip
Drill it in your head, youngun it's that real Hip-
Hop along 'fore you get your little ass whipped

A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
Kendrick, show these muh'fuckers how we rock
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
Big Pooh, show these muh'fuckers how we rock


[Kendrick Lamar:]
We on Ali? You ugly

Everybody, just clap your hands if you're real
Middle finger up, give a fuck how they feel
Be yourself, just show me you're real
Middle fingers up

Just let me be me, hmm
That's the only way I know
Just let me be me, hmm
That's the only way I know
(That's the only way I know how to hold it down
That's-that's the only way I know how to hold it down)

Uh, I just wanna be me
No disrespect, but motherfuck you
My education stopped at a high school degree
But I can outsmart any high IQ
Draped in some fly shit, call me Jeff Goldblum
Cold, my style making my nose run
Oh, I stare at the mirror, then realize
That real lies, within me
Some say I'm crazy cause I think like I need a shrink
Ask too many questions about the stars and Earth shit
Rather be in the studio than out buying drinks
So if I'm not clubbing, don't think I'm on some jerk shit
And California on that jerk shit
But I'd just rather two-step like my first steps
Jill Scott in my iPod as my head rests, yes

Just let me be me, hmm
That's the only way I know
Just let me be me, hmm
That's the only way I know
(That's the only way I know how to hold it down
That's-that's the only way I know how to hold it down)

And yeah I know I'm from Compton, Cali'
But I don't lace up Chucks or rock tan khakis
And skinny jeans ain't quite the lick
I probably would wear 'em but my dick don't fit
Ha-ha-ha, I like to joke, got a sense of humor?
Stale face, play me short like an Oompa-Loompa
You ain't gotta screw up your face in front of the kids
Won't you lighten up like Michael did?
I grew up with killers man, people who killed men
But my character never could be like them, man
And they respect that, say that I'm real man
Not a fake person, that's the Sims, man
Live my life through some film, man?
I ain't acting out shit, I be packing out shows
Cause they know they'll know Kendrick for sure, and oh

Just let me be me, hmm
That's the only way I know
Just let me be me, hmm
That's the only way I know
(That's the only way I know how to hold it down
That's-that's the only way I know how to hold it down)

Almost lost my life to the industry
Had to look through a photo book to remember me
These label heads ain't nothing but bullshit
Have you with professional killers, chasing hits
Lying to yourself all over an image
Making records they want, that was wrecking my brilliance
My mama said, "Boy, that don't sound like you."
I said, "This is the sound, though." my only excuse
Quite frankly, dusted off my shoes with my hankie
And kicked it like he skate, make these motherfuckers hate me
The reason why they hate, cause these motherfuckers ain't me
And you can underrate me, but I know what I'm worth
A diamond in God's dirt, a diamond in winter
Watching Simpsons and eating some cereal for dinner
See I give you my life to mix it up in a blender
To make sure that you feel it

Just let me be me, hmm
That's the only way I know
Just let me be me, hmm
That's the only way I know
(That's the only way I know how to hold it down
That's-that's the only way I know how to hold it down)

[Female:]
Kendrick Lamar, what are you trying to say?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?
Kendrick Lamar, what are you trying to say?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?
Is this really you? Is this who you are?
What are you trying to say?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?
Who are you?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?
Kendrick Lamar, what are you trying to say?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?

[Kendrick Lamar:]
I think that I finally reached the pinnacle
Of finding myself as an individual
The world is so typical
I just wanna be higher than that
I used to want to be the messiah of rap
Infatuated with becoming a relevant star
Trying to say goodbye to the glamorous chains and cars
That I never had, but wrote it in my raps to make you mad
Vanity, they say that it can damage me
So do I really want it?
If I didn't, I guess I'm a cool cocaine connect
That means I'll be fronting, hmm
Cooking in a laboratory, hoping I can tell a story
That the whole world can feel, like the ones that came before me
Knowing that I'm misunderstood
So I gotta get my point across like a snitch would
And I would never walk in the shadow that never was really there
Or try to fill the shoes of an invisible pair
And Dave said he proud of my newfound honesty
And all I could say is "Will the radio care?"
Yeah, or should I say no?
Or should I just stop and come with a whole new approach?
You heard my hip-hop when I was sixteen years old
Well that was me then, now I'm an adult
Twenty-two like the smallest of guns that you know, most determined
But with the smallest of funds to show, but I'm not worried
My talent should take me places I've never been
The world should turn soon as my record spin
I wanna be the highest, on top of all the bullshit
The negative you bring, the stress, the violence
The capital punishment, the loud police sirens
Too focused, one word, righteous
And this is Kendrick Lamar
And soon y'all know Cloud Nine y'all
And that means I wanna be the highest
Too focused, one word (righteous)
Mm, yeah
That means I wanna be the highest
Too focused, one word

[Female:]
Too focused, too focused, one word
Too focused, too focused, one word
Too focused, too focused, one word
Too focused, one word
Too focused, too focused, one word


[Napoleon Hill:]
"I want to describe my discovery in the simplest terms possible because it will reveal to you why it is true that's whatever the mind can conceive and believe, the mind can achieve regardless of how many times you may have failed in the past or how lofty your aims and hopes may be."

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Go-getter with no cheddar
Just a white tee and a swap meet sweater
My life is likely to see great endeavors
But I can't win if I can't get it together
What I gotta do in order to see success?
Having the world's best to call me the best
Pull up at the Grammy Awards best-dressed
With an address linked to a beautiful actress
A dollar and a dream, I feel J. Cole
Word to the hole in my pocket and the hoes
That don't wanna fuck with a broke nigga with ambition
But the last time I checked, y'all was broke bitches
Make a name for myself
Then bubble like the ass of Buffy when she wearing a tight belt
The homies on the block can say whatever they say
I don't wanna be a killer, I wanna be a Gates

[Ash Riser:]
Take your time, it'll come
Just stay focused and humble my son
Show and prove, prove you're the one
It's not about who's dope, it's who wants it the most
So just go out and get it
Go out and get it
Go out and get it
Go out and get it

[Kendrick Lamar:]
What I gotta do in order to see success?
Having the world's best to call me the best
Pull up at the Grammy Awards best-dressed
With an address next to a beautiful actress
Do I gotta run in your spot and start blasting?
Better yet, rob the nearest Nix Check Cashing
Hear a hustle on a nigga that's constantly bragging
Catch him at the light, snatch him out his Jeep wagon
Or maybe I gotta hook up with Jose
Cop five bricks of the yay, head to the Bay
Area, or carry the birds to VA
Let the clips distribute the work all day
Then come back home
Every three weeks, flip three-to-six zones
Homies on the block can say whatever they want
I don't wanna be a dealer, I wanna be a Trump
Donald that is

[Ash Riser:]
Take your time, it'll come
Just stay focused and humble my son
Show and prove, prove you're the one
It's not about who's dope, it's who wants it the most
So just go out and get it
Go out and get it
Go out and get it
Go out and get it

[Kendrick Lamar (over chorus):]
And when I do it, I do it again, then I go back
When I do it, I'll do it again, then I go back
Thug it out, but for now I'm willing to dug it out
I gotta grind, grind

[Kendrick Lamar:]
So welcome to the story of my life
See I'm tryna get right off the shit that I write
Make a fortune, buy some Porsches for my mamma and my wife
Pop's engine in this old school run tight!
But as you listening to K. D-O-T
Me and my girl split the bucket at KFC
She listening to Drake and all I can say
"Damn, these niggas that much better than me
Baby?" I don't think this is meant to be
'Cause I'm always losing self-esteem
She paused the iPhone, then said, "Huh?"
I repeated what I said, then she replied, "Shut up!"
You know you the best boy, you gotta keep doing it
But don't forget when you do, just keep you in it
And never listen to what the industry say
Don't be a typical artist, be more like Jay
Russell, Barry Gordy, Quincy Jones
Bob Johnson, Sean Combs, L.A. Reid
Young black entrepreneurs did what it took to succeed, yeah
So I gotta see success
I gotta make it off them Rosecrans steps
Rising to the top like a soda shook up
'Bout to pop, and I'll pop on whoever's in my way

[Ash Riser:]
Take your time, it'll come
Just stay focused and humble my son
Show and prove, prove you're the one
It's not about who's dope, it's who wants it the most
So just go out and get it
Go out and get it
Go out and get it
Go out and get it

[Kendrick Lamar (over chorus):]
Yeah, I swear to God I don't wanna do it, just live man
I wanna live good
Just wanna make my mamma proud, y'know?
I don't wanna be hard, I don't want the most stripes
I got little brothers and sisters man, I'm the oldest nigga
I just want it, I just want it
And I'ma get it


[Kendrick Lamar:]
Bumping some Sade rolling my window down and hitting the highway
No it's not Friday, but it's my day and sometimes shit gotta go my way
Niggas got me fucked up thinking that my music don't stick like some nunchucks
Top Dawg and we All Stars like we run Chucks, but never mind that
Take a trip to outer space show you where my mind at
You know where my grind at
Inside of the studio is where I spend my time at
Fuck over the game 'til I make that bitch climax
Miss me with that bullshit, haters die young you can run to the pulpit
Pulling off the pit stop, card like a flip flop
Bitches clap at me like they wanna make my piss hot

I don't even trip though I don't need no company
Me, I'm thinking long-term tryin' build a company
Kendrick the Good Kid

[JaVonté:]
As I move, I feel way better doing me
I can only do me
I hope that, you do you
I think to myself truthfully, I can only feel me
Some people say that I'm rude
But I don't give a damn
If she, if he, if them or they say I'm uncool
Nothing will change now I feel me today

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Nigga what I compose be so potent
That if the Earth dried I could spit back the ocean
Then hop on the jet ski and start Westcoastin'

I'm not boasting or bragging
Not a person, I'm a dragon
Taking action in the heat of the night
So if the devil came, tell him that I'll be alright
I'm so high off life that I can OD
Walk outside then sniff a whole key

Oh lady don't call the police
it's just the average Joe walking with his heart on his appendix
Don't be afraid to speak

So to speak, you niggas not within arm-reach
Y'all midget macks swingin' on Shaq now have a seat
You can never co-exist with my mamma's oldest
Kendrick be thy name I got my mind right

My nigga locked in the pen that's why my mind write
Ink over my brain, wha's up?!

[JaVonté:]
As I move, I feel way better doing me
I can only do me
I hope that, you do you
I think to myself truthfully, I can only feel me
Some people say that I'm rude
But I don't give a damn
If she, if he, if them or they say I'm uncool
Nothing will change now I feel me today

[Kendrick Lamar:]
So let me start off the third verse
Pickin' off your favorites since I'm cursed
Fuck the system, fuck the truth, fuck religion
Fuck the government, fuck the law, fuck the prisons
Fuck George Bush, fuck rappers who love dissing
Fuck you because you don't see my vision

I fucked your new girlfriend too because she's cute
And the ass look like a grenade within the denim
Fuck the groupies, fuck the gossipin' bitches
Fuck niggas who can't fight so pull triggers
Fuck the new world gas price that costs a living
Fuck your love, fuck your hate, fuck your snitching
And whether you fuck with me or not
I don't give a fuck you could keep your props
Fuck keeping it real, I'mma keep it K-Dot
Kendrick everyday, JAY-Z didn't lie
Fucker!

[JaVonté:]
As I move, I feel way better doing me
I can only do me
I hope that, you do you
I think to myself truthfully, I can only feel me
Some people say that I'm rude
But I don't give a damn
If she, if he, if them or they say I'm uncool
Nothing will change now I feel me today


[Kendrick Lamar:]
I swear you people don't know Kendrick, you don't know him
But you say you want some more Kendrick, I'm 'bout to show 'em
Everything inside this human being, I'm still growing
I'm a premature baby in this crazy life that we adore
Doors on the Lamborghini, I want 'em
Can't afford 'em so I tell the swap meet to clone 'em
I guess I really am a vanity slave
I guess my ancestors turning in their graves
Burning money when I get it, fuck a life savings
Overdraft bank statements, just to make a statement
When I put this fashion on, I'm a fashion junkie
Picking cotton in the country, I bought this out the country
Whips and chains, whips and chains, Jacob know my name
He call me Kunta, you my brother, we come from the same modern world
That's ya girl? I see she rocking Fendi
Try this on
If it ain't upscale then you may offend me
Copping everything in sight, ignoring their sacrifice
Amnesia if I see the black visa in my hand tonight
I show my dick and then I swipe, that's a punchline
They was hot and I wore ice, that's ironic huh?

[Kendrick Lamar & Gucci Mane:]
Word around town that I'm all about the bitches
Word around town that I love my 26s
Word around town that I gotta stay paid
Lord please forgive me I'm a vanity slave
It's the Gucci cock and shoot
Found my swag but lost my roof, (Burr! Burr!)
Lord please forgive me I'm a vanity slave
See my Audemar tick, as my Audemar tock
Lord please forgive me I'm a vanity slave

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Aw man videos got me wanting hoes
Appetite for flashing lights, all I can do is pose
A black male... on Melrose. I should get blackmailed
By my people hell rose, niggas that ain't had shit
For 400 years overcompensate by over accessorizing with gear
Man y'all don't see my vision
I do it for the love of hip hop and the love of bitches
Am I a hypocrite 'cause everyday I'm contradicting
I think of how I'm living, then I watch "How I'm Living" I know this can't be right
My conscience tell me to stay righteous
It's unlikely to see what I like and say I don't like it
Biggest dilemma my priorities ignoring me, I wanna move accordingly
But baby steps are premature remember?
I'm flying to the south and I'll be gone 'til November
To see my family tree but this a shame I'm yelling, out, timber

[Kendrick Lamar & Gucci Mane:]
Word around town that I'm all about the bitches
Word around town that I love my 26s
Word around town that I gotta stay paid
Lord please forgive me I'm a vanity slave
It's the Gucci cock and shoot
Found my swag but lost my roof, (Burr! Burr!)
Lord please forgive me I'm a vanity slave
See my Audemar tick, as my Audemar tock
Lord please forgive me I'm a vanity slave

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Cold, oh so cold
How ironic he bought it then sold his soul
Is it masonic for your vice to take its toll?
The remote control is taking control
Lift up the doors
That Lamborghini I wanted come with a dumb ass model that in vogue
I like 'em both, I'll wife 'em both
Take these motherfucking Jordan's off, put on my loafs
'Cause nothing goes bad, every time I wear (Gucci)
I'm getting more ass, every time I wear (Gucci)
They told me it's a fad, every time I wear (Gucci)
But should I give a fuck when it bring me more coochie?
This a young nigga's pedigree, I pray the lord can better me
If not he 'bout to strike me down like this my third felony
The voices keep on telling me, Kendrick don't forget about us
I burned my wardrobe, hoping that I could live without it

[Kendrick Lamar & Gucci Mane:]
Word around town that I'm all about the bitches

[Dash Snow (Daniel Joseph) {Kendrick Lamar}:]
I'll tell you what I don't believe in, can I do that?
Alright, I don't believe in the, in laws, or the system by any means, whatsoever
I try not to obey them at any time
That's what I believe in, not believing in
(So what keeps you alive?)
Four big bottles of water a day, two packs of Marlboro Reds and
Uh, I don't—what keeps me alive? Shit, um
Music, I have to listen to music all day long
I'd say that keeps me going
I'm a pretty dark person, I've thought about ending it a million times
And I have to say that music keeps me here, by far, the main thing
{Thank you}

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Sitting in the studio thinking about which mood would go
Right now, freestyle or write down, whatever
It still'll come up clever, I just need to free my thoughts
And Lord knows that I know better, but I ain't perfect
I ain't seen too many churches or know them testament verses
You should either hear me now or go deaf
Or end up dead, die trying and know death
Might end up dead, swallow blood, swallow my breath
Fuck a funeral, just make sure you pay my music respect, nigga
I mean that from the bottom of my heart
You see my art is all I have, and victory tastes sweet
Even when the enemy can throw salt
Still knock 'em out the park like a fucking tow car
Let bygones be bygones, but where I'm from
We buy guns and more guns to give to the young
I'm living the life of a nigga trapped nigga
Inside the system, all you envision is trap niggas
My uncle doing life inside prison, he wasn't wrapped too tight
He told me, "Rap about life, not rap, niggas."
That's why I'm shaking my head when you rap-dissing
My stomach start turning, my nerves get to twitching
I start evaluating, then my final intuition
Is that you wishing a come up, would just come up
We used to beefing over turf, fuck beefing over a verse
Niggas dying, motherfuck a double entendre
And this is Compton, lions in the land of the triumph
Wrap-Saran our defiance, ban our alliance
Put burners in the hands of the black man
One hood with twenty four-fours like a cloned Kobe Bryant
You probably heard I wanna be heard and wonder who I am
You probably even listened to "Faith" and think I know Zion
But really I'm just caught in the loop of understanding the truth
Because it seem like it's always clashing with science
I got a big fear of flying
My future so bright I'd probably go blind before I blink twice, I ain't lying
I swear to God half of y'all just don't know Kendrick
The school of hard knocks, we was the first ones in attendance
You walking down the block, he got shot, you are no eye witness
You just mind your business
You just turn your head, kneel down, and then tie your tennis
It's kinda scary, ain't it?
You can't act like no bitch, that only got Tyler Perry famous
Just let me explain this, why you pick up that stainless?
'Cause your pops wasn't anxious to see you and you hated it
So much, you probably had your burner tucked at graduation
Said if you see him on them bleachers then you kill him, facing
Twenty-five to life with a murder charge
Your enemies was the prey, and now you pray to God
I pray these bars get farther than Compton
And if our record never break I still won't break my promise, I promise to keep it honest
Secret society, all we ask is trust
And all we lack is communication like service sucks
The people scared of annihilation when Kingdom Come
And I'm like, "The Kendrick Lamar O.D. in less than a month
Alright?" Gotta keep it pushing
Can't let the government tell me how my future looking
I'm on Rosecrans and Central trying to duck the central bookings
If the fucking pigs get behind me then you know I'm bucking, never will I surrender
I've been a warrior when I came out of my mom's placenta
In the gutter lane like I'm Master Splinter
How splendid, I guess my project had did it
Got all these niggas approaching their mixtapes different
They said seven tracks, I said fifteen
Called it an EP, they said I'm tripping
But little did they know, I'm tryna change the rules
That we've been confined to, so the corporate won't make decisions
Uppity bitches, handling business
Killing our dreams, stealing our vision
Out in Haiti adolescents barely have a home
In L.A. everybody think they're fucking on
Hop on Twitter, perpetrate, we doing big shit
Who we hanging with, and bragging about the iPhone
I swear to God, most of y'all cats just don't know Kendrick
You barely know yourself, so I guess most of y'all should be offended
Ain't doing this for my health, I'm just trying to purchase my mamma them Benzes
Occupying my time with riches, justifying my time, ambitions
Just to coincide, just to go inside, plus we idolize why we living
Look the mastermind, took the master's mind, just the perfect time, just to master mine
Just to match the grind with precision, look the mastermind, took the

[Alori Joh:]
We would like to call this an appreciation tape for those who recognized the Kendrick Lamar EP for this is the Kendrick Lamar O.D
Because of you, we are Overly Dedicated


[Jhene Aiko (Kendrick Lamar):]
Where are we going? Why are we slowing down
Where are you going? We should be growing now
(Smoke to it nigga, smoke to it nigga )
Where are we going? We should be slowing down
Where are you going? We should be growing now

[Kendrick Lamar:]
That's what she said to me, that place I used to call home
Is just a bed to me
We don't even sleep, neighbors can hear her weep
Meanwhile I'm in these streets with everybody, I'm trying to get it
And she know they got me, I watch her feelings watch me
As they staring with the saddest eyes of loneliness
Look each other in the face and barely blink
I tried to make it right but the pen ran out of ink
So if my letters don't reach you, I hope these lyrics in sync

[Jhene Aiko:]
Where are we going? Why are we slowing down
Where are you going? We should be growing now

[Kendrick Lamar:]
That's what it said to me
But the place I call ambition now dead to me
Gone and forgotten, I'm off track like Dale Earnhardt
My liver rotten, alcoholic tripping
Fucking bad bitches and they got bad intentions
Club night, guys and dolls
Balling out but I'm 'bout to drop the ball
I'm calling out for help, my engineer called
Told me come to the studio but I wanna tell him, nah

[Jhene Aiko:]
Where are we going? Why are we slowing down
Where are you going? We should be growing now

[Kendrick Lamar:]
That's what he said to me
But that place we call Heaven's unfair to me
Only a hundred and forty-four can go
Seven billion people on planet Earth today
Is there something that I don't know
I know to follow Him rather following people
Or follow vanity 'cause that means I'm following evil
Guess I'm following evil, I should follow cathedral
Blessings I need but live like I don't need you

[Jhene Aiko:]
Where are we going? Why are we slowing down
Where are you going? We should be growing now

[Kendrick Lamar:]
So in conclusion
We all seem to stumble, planning our own demise
Forgetting the big picture and making it wallet size
So to what is important in my life, I apologize
I promise to stay faithful, focused and sanctified
We all get distracted, the question is
Would you bounce back or bounce backwards?
Would you not know how to act or take action?
It's just a part of life and if your vision's impaired, you probably lose it all tonight

[Jhene Aiko:]
Tryna visualize how to get it right but my vision's so blurry
Tryna slow it down, stay close to the ground, but we're always in a hurry now
And if I could make this world spin a little slower, then I would
Then we could grow a little closer, I think we're getting closer
I think we're getting closer


I remember, uh
When my uncles
Served smokers
On Alondra
In front of our building, they was my heroes

This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
Bad bitches, crackheads, street niggas, crack hoes
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe

Uh, and that's scary to me
Dope beat, dope flow, vary to me
Especially when Sounwave is on his Ps
Nigga cue me in I'm a Peruvian drug lord
Don't fast forward, I'ma serve you some keys
This is crack cocaine, I'm Kurt Cobain
And I bang like a C-R-I-P
P-I-R-U, high you I'm a I-V
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack—STOP
I said a I-V 'cause when I be in the studio, I shot
A needle in your veins, take it in vein
Or itch 'til your eyeballs pop
I'm cold on the cold turkey
I hate chickens but I do fuck pretty birdies
Where your girl at? Over the Pyrex, where my world at

This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
Bad bitches, crackheads, street niggas, crack hoes
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe

Uh, and it's scary to me
Every listener is a strawberry to me
You pussies ain't shit but venereal disease
Z's on K.Dot? Uh-uh better wake up
A nightmare, I'm right there like a Siamese
Twin, when, you motherfuckers gon' learn?
Curl up like Big Worm when I drop
Who fly? I'm a red eye with eye drops
I Big, I Pac, you Chris, I Rock
That's Pookie on New Jack head first with a cyclops
I'm the first one to do that I bet you never knew that
Back like a tailbone, who you got to tell on?
If ain't about me about ho it be about face
If you ain't on higher—learning
There's soda in the pot and the fire—burning

This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
Bad bitches, crackheads, street niggas, crack hoes
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe

Uh, and it's scary to carry
A smooth type flow like a drink of Merlot
That'll freak y'all out like a girl Virgo
When I turbo on any track, it's a Reynold's wrap
And I rap like a nigga who invented rap
Rapping heat, you can fall to defeat
If you don't pay ya tolls like the limbs on ya feet
I suppose this is bigger than life
This is probably everybody, Illuminati
Guess I'm the blood sacrifice of the party
I undress her like a Harley
Lights will flash, cars will crash
Smoke more junk while the junkies laugh
So my bad if I put you in rehab
You are reimbursed, put it on my tab

This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
Bad bitches, crackheads, street niggas, crack hoes
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe

Aw dude, you're about to fuckin' OD bro


[Part I]

"Gina, baby, I don't have no money, I don't have no ends
Gina, I'm ass-out"
"I'm going through something right now!"
"I done told you that"

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Oh, what up ho? Oh, what up?
I said, oh, what up ho? Oh, what up?
I said, oh, what up ho? Oh, what up?
Well, alright

I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice

I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice

Welcome to my diary, stressing got me gray hairs
Something to inspire me, rather than society's
Woes, let me go, let me shine a lil' bit, love
I want diamonds, too: Ronnie on Player's Club
I used to have a nine-to-five; fresh out of school—that was '05
That bitch was racist, got me fired
Ever since then, I had no job
Pushing in my mamma van, stop for gas on Rosecrans
Trust me, these niggas rushed me for something my cousin prolly did
Guilty by association: story of my life, nigga
You gon' make me flip and split your shit, judge give me life, nigga
Pain since my grandma's death, Uncle killed at Louie's Burgers
Hold my tears, I tried my best; let it go, drench my pullover
Cycles of a starving artist, tryna go beyond the margin— margin
Maintaining my modest— modest as I dream
So while I go through all this— all this bullshit, what you call it
Life itself, I know what helps, let me scroll through my Blackberry
("Hey, what's up, daddy?")

I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice

I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice

[Part II]

"So what'd you rush me over here for?
How was your day?
Are you tipsy?"

"Mhm!"

[Kendrick Lamar:]
All I need in this lifetime: pussy and Patrón
Give me that, once you give me that, once again, it's on
Bitch, I'm swagged up, hoes bopping when I'm off that Screw
Coming down clean, tell your baby mamma, "What it do?"
Where your friends at? I got long dick—what it is?
Go'n' poke it out, situate your little positives
How I live? Big shot, on my grind, already
I'ma lay it down like a carpenter when you let me

Give me that funk
That sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff
I can't get enough
If I offend you, blame it on the liquor, babe
Give me that funk
That sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff
I can't get enough
If I offend you

Ugh, I wrote this song when Dave drove home
And caught that flat in the mean T-Flats
And it made me think if we could blink
To change locations where we at
We often get lost in the alcohol bottle
In attempt to ignore pain, problem, and sorrow
Just for a minute, then back to the bullshit
Your car note due, and you 'bout to get evicted
Two drugs, surely, Patrón, pussy, make it feel alright
But once it's empty and that bitch leave, then it's back to life
You can't run from it, gotta run to it, nigga
The antidote wouldn't last, and you knew it, nigga
But still, you proceed to dive deep, ask what's her Zodiac sign

I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice

I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice

[Ab-Soul:]
Okay, welcome to my diary—hmm, where should I begin?
Finna get a Swisher and fill it with at least a gram
Crackers watch my every step; man, I hate to work for them
One time, I tried to work for me, but that shit didn't work for me
And here I am, stressing, questioning my direction man
What to do? Nothing's moving, traffic jam, wiggle through it
Pop the cork and take the fluid, bust that pussy open
Bust that pussy open, bust that pussy open
(Soul!) Balls deep, you dig?
Retrieve relief, you dig?
Let's kill a bottle of tequila
And lie butt-naked telling the truth, would you?
What's up?
I had a long day, and I really wanna fuck
Take a double-shot to the face and forget about my whole day
'Cause all I've been thinking the whole day (Whole day, whole day)

[Kendrick Lamar:]
I'm going through something in life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice

I'm going through something in life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice

All I need in this lifetime: pussy and Patrón
Give me that, once you give me that, once again, it's on
Bitch I'm swagged up, hoes bopping when I'm off that Screw
Coming down clean, tell your baby mamma, "What it do?"
Where your friends at? I got long dick—what it is?
Go'n' poke it out, situate your little positives
How I live? Big shot, on my grind, already
I'ma lay it down like a carpenter when you let me


She looks better than Beyonce, Alicia Keys, Halle Berry, Miss Jolie
Where's she from? No I.D. (That girl's an alien)
And if I die before I wake, I pray that I'm in outer space
UFO fly away (So let's go-go, go-go, let's go-go, go-go)

Uh, she got me going, I'm all in
Fifty stories, I'm falling
Where you been? Is it planet Mars?
Far beyond the stars? Are you a Martian?
You're unfamiliar but still, I feel ya
Energy is sending me towards the ceiling
I'm high now, are you up there?
If you was, I would climb every other stair
I gotta stare, I mean wow
And I'm wowed, no one compares
A one-on-one, you must have won
Every pageant in America when you was young

Lips, hips, hair drips down her back
(Crazy) Body frame (Crazy) Insane (Crazy)
The only girl that can make time
Then make me, stop

She looks better than Beyonce, Alicia Keys, Halle Berry, Miss Jolie
Where's she from? No I.D. (That girl's an alien)
And if I die before I wake, I pray that I'm in outer space
U-F-O fly away (So let's go-go, go-go, let's go-go, go-go)

Uh, so now we on, so now we going
Living in the city of the unknown
I show her off, I stunt with her
We do it sweet, they look bitter
Look at her get up, I hear 'em say
But why him? I hear 'em hate
I laugh at it rather than jab at it
Then continue eternal life as a crack addict
'Cause I'm addicted, and you the drug
Cold turkey? No sir
You gotta be an Odyssey from heaven and above
You definite, not, probably I gotta give it up

Lips, hips, hair drips down her back
(Crazy) Body frame (Crazy) Insane (Crazy)
The only girl that can make time
Then make me, stop

She looks better than Beyonce, Alicia Keys, Halle Berry, Miss Jolie
Where's she from? No I.D. (That girl's an alien)
And if I die before I wake, I pray that I'm in outer space
UFO fly away (So let's go-go, go-go, let's go-go, go-go)

You something different, I'm glad I found you
So pretty, I'll never do anything to hurt you


[Kendrick Lamar:]
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah
Uh, yeah, uh
We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
Hurt people that love us, love people
I'm inspired, so get inspired

And so he said "Why you gotta be so kind-hearted?
Why you couldn't be a con artist? Why you couldn't?
Why you couldn't be mischievous or just a little devious
The moment that we first started?
Why you never ask for nothing, just a little time?
Why you let me use yours 'cause I don't got mines?
Why you always lift me up, when I'm completely giving up
And when niggas holler, "What's up?" you give a dry response?
Why you giving me your last knowing you ain't got it?
Why you always buy me something when you going shopping?
Why you tell me that you love me?
Why you always thinking of me?
Want my company rather than going club hopping?
Why you treating my mamma like she your mamma too?
Why you making promises that you'll forever do?
Whatever just to make me happy, wanting us to have a family
These are exactly the reasons why I cheat on you" (Sometimes)

We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
Hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
Hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
Hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us

[JaVonté:]
Sometimes I, sometimes I feel we share
Nothing in common, it ain't fair
But where do we seem to fall?
Where do we seem to fall?
Tender love and care, once upon a time
Once upon a time, we was there

[Kendrick Lamar:]
And so she said "Why you gotta be so mean to me?
Why you don't know what you mean to me?
Why you always playing games? Why I feel like you ashamed
Out in public curse me out and make a scenery?
Why you got other bitches rolling their eyes at me?
Why text messages popping up saying, "Hi, Daddy"?
Why you treat me like I'm nothing? Why you always at a function?
I be wanting to go out but you don't ever ask me
Why you slip and say her name when we having sex?
Why you always assuming that I still like my ex?
Every time we get into it, I'm the one that's feeling stupid
You don't need me, you gon' leave me, that's your favorite threat
Why you never know how it feel to be lonely?
Why I feel I'm the last option after your homies?
Why you always gotta know that I will never let you go
Even though you get violent and put your hands on me?"
Sometimes

We hurt people that love us, love people that
Hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
Hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
Hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us

[JaVonté:]
Sometimes I, sometimes I feel we share
Nothing in common, it ain't fair
But where do we seem to fall?
Where do we seem to fall?
Tender love and care, once upon a time
Once upon a time, we was there

[Lamont Carey:]
She says she loves me
She says she loves me
So she clings to me, even when I want to be left alone
But she's beautiful
Like, sometimes, when I have things on my mind, she's the perfect person to listen
And she only gives advice, she says, when I give her a cue
She says she loves me
Like when I wake up in the morning, she's sitting on the edge of the bed with a plate of food, wanting to feed me
She says she needs me
She says she loves me
Or like when I'm stepping out of the shower, she's standing there with the towel, wanting to, wanting to dry me off
She says, she says she loves me
So instead of admitting that she has made another mistake
She says she loves me... and I don't know about love


[Alori Joh:]
I used to wanna be like Michael Jordan
Figured I would hit the NBA and make me a fortune

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Uh, every time I'm in my city, I be acting like my shit don't stink
Used to clean my Rollie chain with alcohol in the sink
Riding around with niggas that I grew up with since McNair
Bumpin' "Me Against the World". Hello, world. Kendrick here
And I'm too much for these niggas, I'm three much for these hoes
I'm too much for these niggas, I'm three much for these hoes
I'm too much for these niggas, I'm three much for these hoes
Wayne told me that and that's just how it goes

Michael Jordan
Bounce-bounce ho, bounce-bounce

This shit make a nigga wanna get some bread or bust a head
Or fuck my enemy's bitch, acting bad and getting rich
Pull up on these 26's, I'm a vanity slave
I'm a sinner, Jesus Christ, please forgive me for my ways
I don't know why your bitch want to fuck me
And I don't know why you fuck niggas can't see
I'm a Comp-town representer, a concrete back-flipper
A.K.A. that nigga, don't wuwwy!
I don't know why your bitch want to fuck me
And I don't know why you fuck niggas can't see
This is HiiiPower, since the Eddie Bauer I been popular
I'm popping now, every other hour paparazzi come
You jocking her, let her be a ho, why you stopping though?
We stopping the traffic, what you know 'bout them hockey pucks?
Skating on 'em, why you hating on 'em? You should learn from 'em
Seen too many of y'all getting money, know my turn coming
I don't know why your bitch wanna fuck me
I don't know why (Hey, wait a minute, motherfucker)

Every time I'm in my city, I be feeling like my shit don't stink
Used to clean my Rollie chain with alcohol in the sink
Ridin' 'round with niggas that I grew up with since McNair
Bumpin' "Me Against the World". Hello, world. Kendrick here
And I'm too much for these niggas, I'm three much for these hoes
I'm too much for these niggas, I'm three much for these hoes
I'm too much for these niggas, I'm three much for these hoes
Wayne told me that and that's just how it goes
Michael Jordan bitch, Michael Jordan bitch, Michael Jordan bitch
Michael Jordan bitch, that means I'm too much for these niggas
I'm three much for these hoes
Wayne told me that and that's just how it goes

Man, the game chose me, what am I to do?
The only thing I did wrong was make it possible
I diddy bop and make them titties pop
Out there on my bumper like a city cop
Walking out the Fred Segal, put my girl on it
Ass so fat, probably sit the world on it (Aye)
Pussy crazy, pussy crazy
You fuck niggas, you pussies crazy
Man, I know I can't tell you about the world homie
But I know I can tell you about your girl homie
Her pussy crazy, her pussy crazy, I fuck nigga, I know you hate me
I know they pay me too much of attention
Bring my name up, it gotta be mentioned
I need me an engine that go real fast
Call it "Hall Of Fame" once it haul ass
Give me tall glass, Coconut Cîroc
Please, no soda pop, I make my solo pop
Life's a bitch, her pussy crazy
But I make that pussy pay me

Every time I'm in my city, I be feeling like my shit don't stink
Used to clean my Rollie chain with alcohol in the sink
Riding around with niggas that I grew up with since McNair
Bumpin' "Me Against the World". Hello, world. Kendrick here
And I'm too much for these niggas, I'm three much for these hoes
I'm too much for these niggas, I'm three much for these hoes
I'm too much for these niggas, I'm three much for these hoes
Wayne told me that and that's just how it goes
Michael Jordan bitch, Michael Jordan bitch, Michael Jordan bitch
Michael Jordan bitch, that means I'm too much for these niggas
I'm three much for these hoes, Wayne told me that

[Schoolboy Q:]
I remember tripping, walking through the set
Like my Glock don't think
Grandma in the kitchen, neck bones in the sink
I don't know why your bitch want to fuck me
And I don't know why you sucker niggas can't see
I'm from Hoover man, high as Superman, shit you Lois Lane
You pussy man with the pussy game, shit, we off the chain
We popping the fortune, not the fame, shit, you backwards, man
You chasing hoes, we replacing those, bag and pass them hoes
Your broad done chose, guess she moving on, yep, we do it wrong
We fucked her homes, fucked and sent her home, marijuana strong
You know I'm gon' turn my swagger on, am I swagged enough?
My paper long, yep, you left alone, y-y-you gets no fucks
Leaning off the Actavis, passing blunts 'round and 'round
Told me Mary was a go so we passed her 'round and 'round
Your bitch texted me, wants it now so I had to knock her down
Hurt her bouncing off my balls, slinging dick up from the mouth
You let it slide, I hit home-runs, clean her dugout 'til I'm done
I can be her number two and you can be her number one
Her pussy' crazy, her pussy crazy
You fuck niggas!

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Lord forgive me

Kill him where he stand and stand over him
Shake his hand, then jump back in that minivan
Double back to his block and blam
I ain't backing down for nothing
I'ma back 'em down like Shaq
With this black 2-2-3 in my hand
Better pray that this chopper jam like a radio single, man
Police radio signals saying that a 187 land on your corner
Coroners comfort your mamma
"Mamma, he's dead," the next morning
I toasted up with my homies
We drink and smoke marijuana
Want us to change our ways? Uh-huh
You see this game we play come from
Uncles that raised me in Compton
Ask me what I have accomplished
I don't know, I don't have conscience
I just load up and start dumping on enemies
I'm headhuntin', no sympathy
Ain't no love when you in these streets
Just get something, protect your neck
'Cause they coming for sets, respect
Split your onion, then chop your deck
Your head tumbling like gymnastics (Ooh...)
'Cause ignorance is bliss

[ScHoolboy Q:]
Now everybody put your hands up high
If you don't give a fuck, put your hands up high

[Kendrick Lamar:]
This the hardest shit you've heard from LA this far
And I'm this far from a discharge, but never will I diss y'all
We all tryna ball, and when I got the rock, I'll dish off
Until the day I pistol-whip you posers 'til y'all pissed off
Then peel off in a hoopty
Come back and make these niggas wanna shoot me

And they bitches wanna salute me or seduce me
Indubitably, I'm too street—indubitably, I'ma do me
Better than your bitch would, 'cause you niggas too weak
But just give me two weeks and I'm good
I'll make an album that'll put a smile on Malcolm
Make Martin Luther tell God I'm the future for Heaven's talent
No tarot card reading; I'm foreseeing you niggas vanish
Not only from the rap game—I'm including the planet
Cats so watered-down, clowns can sink Titanic
Tie titanium around their neck and watch 'em panic
Give me respect, dammit, or get damaged
Die young, corpse identified by your parents
Apparently, you're a parrot, mocking me and my blueprint
But I won't share it, just make you cop it, then call you a sheriff
Stop it, I'm hearin' the comments
The critics are calling me conscious
But truthfully, every shooter be callin' me Compton
So truthfully, only calling me Kweli and Common?
Proves... that ignorance is bliss

[ScHoolboy Q:]
Now everybody put your hands up high
If you don't give a fuck, put your hands up high

[Kendrick Lamar:]
And this still the hardest shit you've heard from LA this far
And I'm this far, from a discharge, but never will I diss y'all
This my world, I grab the universe then play kickball
And they wonder why these California earthquakes hittin' so hard

I'm So-Cal, you so-called rappers need to go call Ghostbusters
'Cause you busters are Casper when I go off
I show up to show out and show off
You a hundred percent behind me
And if you are, then wreck your car
And walk up to my crime scene
I remember bein' seventeen, wishin' someone would sign me
Now the only way these labels get me back is when they rewind me
Backin' down bargains, backin' down bitches
We gon' flip her
Once she off that blue dolphin, you gon' tip her
'Cause ignorance is bliss

And Willie B, I'm a fool on your beats
I bleed out the speaker as the speaker that spoke when they didn't speak


[Kendrick Lamar:]
This is me thinking at 4:43 AM, June 6th

Sometimes I wanna say fuck rapping, I need money now
Like should I start trapping?
If what I write down don't collect this very moment
Then I'm on it, no question
In the streets, my niggas is well connected, let's see
Do I cop a pound of kush, Promethazine or push some E?
Oxycontin have me laying on soft cotton when I sleep?
This is deep as the abyss, I'm not just rhyming on the beat
I be in spots, chopping the rocks like Flintstone feet
This is me, frustrated, battling my own evils
Finna saddle up that work across Ohio in a Geo
Or should I sell my music .zip to buy your zip
And hope one day it flourish to a kilo
Track record of a hustler
Rather records on the needle, making music
Clocking fast bank like a shot from Patrick Ewing
My nigga, what you doing on these corners whipping?
"I thought you had a show?" Well, my nigga, I guess I didn't
I'm tryna get this dough, and easy money sounds tempting
Especially when your homies pushing V8 engines
Twenty-two on twenty-sixes, Range Rovers rolling up
Three-fifty for an ounce of fire, I hope I got enough
This industry calling my bluff, I need a new solution
Curb-serving, or I might be in your store boosting
Two-elevens with Mac-11s like fuck hip-hop
Don't wanna be Pun, don't wanna be B.I.G., don't wanna be Pac
Just give me your funds, A.K.A. everything that you got
Or everything getting shot, for nothing
Leave you in shock, coughing up blood and mumbling
Watch, the plans of a young man sponsor
Moving grams like relocating your mom's mamma
Then expand to the Hoover Dam, water, sherm
Contraband, they yearn for the butt-naked
Fuck a verse, verses get let off in thirty minutes, six seconds
I disperse to the world of unruly, where I put the mic down
And pick up a sack and a toolie, if you knew me
You'll know I always had a passion for riddling, writing
But lately, I've been thinking 'bout taking chances to brighten
My future financially, so please don't be mad at me
I gotta do what I gotta do, no shit
So I tell my nigga, "Front me, let me put it on the strip"
Then give it back when I think about the consequence
Shit

[BJ the Chicago Kid:]
There are times, when you need someone
I will be by your side
Oh darling, 'cause there is a light that shines
Special for you, and me yeah
I-take-I-take-take my chances-chances-chances
Before they pass, they pass, they pass
Pass me by, oh darling
You've got to look at the other side

[Kendrick Lamar:]
R.O.T.C—Right On Time Conscience


[Kendrick Lamar:]
One time
Reporting live
Compton, California

Have you ever felt like, like you never get life?
Like you never did right, sort of like a black sheep?
Back down, backing out your dreams like some bad sleep
Chasing for the wind but you never win the track meet
Oh, what a cold world for a broke nigga, it's bitter
And life's a bitch, don't hit women, so I bit her
I struck enough pain let her know I wasn't playing
I was so sincere like Nas' first name in Belly
They tell me, it's very difficult to see 25
And if I survive it's probably with a celly
My opportunities are low because my brown complexion floats
In the ghetto rather in some heels like Giuseppe's
They want me unemployed, until I hit the streets
Fulfilling voids of broke D-Boys selling weed
Fucking up my prestige, 'til I live with the blues
BB King or the neighbors of Snoop, that's why I'm

[Kendrick Lamar (Ash Riser) {Alori Joh}:]
In the club like fuck it, though
They say it's only one life, life, life
And if you say I can't live comfortable
I'ma tell you that's a lie, lie, lie
So while I hold this bottle of Ciroc with a hand full of ass
Celebrate the very day that I get past
{Through the barbed wire}
(We are, we are) Fighters
(We are, we are) True
(Through the, through barbed) Wires
(We will, will break) Through
So while I hold this bottle of Ciroc with a hand full of ass
Celebrate the very day that I get past
{Through the barbed wire}

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Have you ever felt like, like you never get life?
Like you never did right, sort of like a black sheep?
Tryna get away from the world's stereotype
Barbed wire got a barricade on your destiny, she desperately
In need of some inspiration, see what the people saying
She gon' have a baby then flee from her education
At the age of 16, credit-card scam schemes
See a scar on her eye, boyfriend brutality
She'll never get by, no how, no way
Welfare recipient, property of the state
Housing, Section 8, corner store prostitute
The owner 'bout to prosecute, the niggas tell her that she's cute
Hoodrat trashy, six baby daddies
And this baby daddy is new to the family
Chilling in pajamas, waiting on the first
Fast forward spilling drinks on her fur, that's why she

[Kendrick Lamar (Ash Riser) {Alori Joh}:]
In the club like fuck it, though
They say it's only one life, life, life
And if you say she can't live comfortable
She gon' tell you that's a lie, lie, lie
So while she up in VIP pouring Merlot in the glass
Celebrate the very day that she get past
{Through the barbed wire}
(We are, we are) Fighters
(We are, we are) True
(Through the, through barbed) Wires
(We will, will break) Through
So while she up in VIP pouring Merlot in the glass
Celebrate the very day that she get past
{Through the barbed wire}

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Have you ever felt like, you finally got life
You finally got right? No longer a black sheep
Living off ya dreams like Christina uh-Milian
In the front seat of a convertible eloping to get married
What a feeling of overcoming the odds
It's like we just hit the lottery, my God
There must be a god, 'cause golly
You done made it through the fight while squabbling Ali
Now ya lifestyle's looking up and you escaped the crooked cuffs
And you ain't have to kill a nigga just to make a couple bucks
And she ain't have to go and fuck on everybody for a dollar
Making good decisions, got a independent business-mind
And both of y'all are steady grindin', doing it the legal way
Just tryna make a decent pay on every second of the day
But they won't give you the credit, disses out their mouth
You must have joined the Illuminati just to ball out

[Kendrick Lamar (Ash Riser) {Alori Joh}:]
In the club like fuck it, though
They say it's only one life, life, life
And if you say they can't live comfortable
They're gon' tell you that's a lie, lie, lie
So even if you overcame doubt and ya living ain't bad
Know it's a barbed wire that's always in your path
{Through the barbed wire} Just laugh
Then everybody say

[Alori Joh:]
'Cause I won't get caught again
And I'm here to stop the trends
You can catch me if you try
Disappear into the night
And I'm gone

[Alori Joh (Kendrick Lamar):]
(So you made it past all the barbed wires?)
There's one more left


The hardest thing for me to do
Is to get you, to know me, within sixteen bars
That's the hardest thing

Who is K. Dot? A young nigga from Compton
On the curb writing raps next to a gunshot
On the corners where the gangsters and the killers dwell
The fraudulent tender scars that get unveiled
Everyone I knew was either Crip or Piru
Cousins in elementary, relatives in high school
With that being said, each one of their rivals
Was aiming something at my head, I needed survival
Got jumped, got jacked, shot at, shot back
And I don't even push a line, I'm just tryna push these rhymes
In the midst of staying neutral and discrete
My momma said you're judged by the company you keep
But what you can consider, that if it goes down
They'll kill you if you kill me, it gets deep nigga
So if you ask what I'm doing
I'm tryna duck the influence of my city that's brewing, real talk, and

This is why they fuck with me (real talk nigga, believe it)
This is why they fuck with me (do what I do, ya know?)
I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (know that)
But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know

I was walking from Centennial
When an unidentified vehicle rolled up, and I was like "Hol' up"
"Where you from?" I don't bang
"Where you stay?" Westside, that's a Piru gang to be exact
Well aware they had blue across their hat
Dropped backpack and ran inside of the cul-de-sac
Shots rang out, hoping to God I wasn't wet
Crossed across Rosecrans and ran inside of the yet
Chirped the homies on the I-95, they said they already knew
What happened, and meet 'em outside the garage
Never seen that many guns in my life
I was paranoid like a fiend in the night, but needed revenge
Grabbed the nine-ball, opened up the door, then got in
Somebody said, "Fall back, we gon' make these niggas suffer
You my brother like a frat, and that's just to remind you."
Thought about that so long I had failed my finals, fuck, but

This is why they fuck with me (I told you, nigga)
This is why they fuck with me (you fake nigga)
I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (you fake)
But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know

I don't do black music, I don't do white music
I do everyday life music
Give 'em cuts like a nigga pierced a knife through it
You say you through, but I've been through it, now that's cold
And this is for my county building children
In Hub City on hubcaps, no power-steering
I use perseverance in this mad city
Where the niggas drink Remy and hold semis for cutthroats
Bernie Mac died, it's no joke
Don't ask why if you don't know about these killers and thieves
Seven grams of weed, you smoke that, but I'm high off life
I could fall out the sky like twice
And land in the land of the AKs
And the minivans where the fan never on
'Cause it's hotter than a lunatic's underarms in a straitjacket
In other words, we get it cracking, but I keep it cool, you know?

This is why they fuck with me (ha ha)
This is why they fuck with me (real talk)
I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (come on)
But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know

So there you have it
But I'mma leave you with this
An O.G. once told me
A real gangster is either dead or in jail
Or behind the scenes getting real money
I'm gone


H.O.C., H.O.C.
All the real smokers get me H.O.C.
All the real smokers get me H.O.C.
H.O.C., H.O.C.
All the real smokers get me H.O.C.
All the real smokers get me H.O.C.

Everybody know I spit that other shit
Shit that make you duck for cover shit
Shit that make you hop out your seat and slap your mother shit
Especially when Drop drop the beat
I drop jewels like my nuts dropped out of my briefs
Jump in the booth and shatter every rapper's dream
They jump in a sauna because I killed their self-esteem
That's a jab, you should bob and weave
Like Pam when Martin pulled jokes out his sleeve
I go in studio sessions and feel like a nerd
'Cause I'm the only nigga there not smoking no herb
You telling me the kush make you think on level four?
I'm on five, you saying that I can level more?
In high school, my teachers thought I was smoking stress
Didn't know my eyes low 'cause of genetic defects
I stimulate my mind every time I think about the end of time
Creation of man, and Columbine

Bet you think that this some high shit that I wrote
Probably think I'm off the kush or the hydro
(Nope) I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I really appreciate that you share your Indo
But a sip of Henny is the farthest I would go
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke

Look, nowadays everybody think they're big chiefers
Just 'cause they heard that new tape from Wiz Khalifa
Knowing damn well they can't hit the sour
They're new booties, they probably need baby powder
My skill shower over your city for 40 days
40 nights, off the chain, like freedom of slaves
Before you get it twisted, like 40 gays
My flow worth the earth, that's not to be appraised
Those the type of lines that I'm talking 'bout
You know the type of rhymes you don't talk about
Copy my session on a disc when the session ends
So my mamma can have it and play it for her friends
Brag on me, like "My son's 'bout to win
Somehow, someday, and I don't care when"
I might hit the gin once a month
I'll let you inhale, like an atheist

Bet you think that this some high shit that I wrote
Probably think I'm off the kush or the hydro
(Nope) I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I really appreciate that you share your Indo
But a sip of Henny is the farthest I would go
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke

I'll take you back to the 9th grade
When Dough Boy had me high for 4 days
That's my nigga, he a street nigga
Probably in your hood, fucking up your street, nigga
But anyway I think it was some purple
Told me, "Don't hit it hard because it'll hurt you."
I didn't listen, I was floating like the Rose Parade
Swear to God a nigga seen some flying fishes
That was the Vegas trip, Hooters sponsored
The same time I start writing like a fucking monster
I'm Frankenstein every time this motherfucker ponders
Just underline every letter, capital K-D-O-T
Laying it flat out, like a tire with slow leaks
Now what you 'bout? Nothing huh
Am I a square 'cause I don't puff a square?
Are my raps too blunt to hit the blunt? Yeah

Bet you think that this some high shit that I wrote
Probably think I'm off the kush or the hydro
(Nope) I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I really appreciate that you share your Indo
But a sip of Henny is the farthest I would go
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke

H.O.C., H.O.C.
All the real smokers give me H.O.C
(Bitch I'm blowed!)


Ali, you thirsty on Twitter!
You boo-boo, you T'd
You turned down, you thirsty
You boo-boo!

Uh, I'm tryna learn something new
I'm tryna find myself, I'm searching deep for Kendrick Lamar
I read about Napoleon Hill and try to know God
They say he the key to my blessings, and if I speak the good
Into existence, that instant my dreams will unlock
Money flow like water, I'll just wait at the dock
And by the way I'ma start, finding more light to shed
Like a small garage in your backyard
I'm back chilling with a friend of mine, she mighty fine
But I notice that her heart resides next to bitterness
Always hollering who she don't like and who she kick it with
Who she wanna fight, who wearing a weave
Who Dooney and Bourke bag is fake, who holding the keys
To the car she drove last year or who fucking on who
And who need a pap smear, getting on my nerves
But before your negative energy curve, bitch I'ma cut you off

'Cause every time you come around
You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
He say, she say, oh my God
Shut the fuck up... hoe
Every time you come around
You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
He say, she say

Uh, I'm tryna learn something new
I'm tryna surround myself with people that inspire me
Or at least inquire similar desires
To do what it T-A-K-E just to reach the T-O-P
I'm talking ideas, motivation
It's more than making, enemies, my nigga
Oh, that's not your memo? Then tell me why you constant stressing
On how you well connected like centipedes, my nigga
I function with you and you flaunt your pistol
Every second tell me how you pressed 'em at the Monte Cristo
Where so and so from, and what neighborhoods beefing
Who baby mamma's a rat, and who got killed last weekend
That shit is mad depressing, bringing me down
Speak on somethin' with some substance that can get us both paid
Rather than telling me how these niggas joking your style
Or his rims ain't bigger, pussy nigga, I'ma cut you off

'Cause every time you come around
You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
He say, she say, oh my God
Shut the fuck up... scary ass
Every time you come around
You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
He say, she say

Uh, I'm tryna learn something new
I'm tryna better my chances of becoming a star
I'm tryna feel the vibe of Mona Lisa
Studying art... now paint that picture
Life behind bars, remember the very day I got caught?
I murdered a rapper, and you filed the police report?
See what I was taught, family is all I need
But indeed them too can run me right up a tree
Constantly talking shit 'bout the next relative
Wanting me to take sides, but I'd never give in
Ever since grandma died, everyone parted ways
Argue on holidays, left my uncle in prison
For 15 years, no one paid him attention but moms
Yeah, my mamma as loyal as any sister would come
Come to my house just to yap about your own people
Dang, and if your blood wasn't running through my veins
I would prolly cut y'all off too, yep

'Cause every time y'all come around
Y'all be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
He say, she say, oh my God, shut the fuck up
Keep it running, Ali
Every time you come around
You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
He say, she say

So tell 'em, "Shut the fuck up!"
Tell 'em, "Shut the fuck up!"
Yeah, bitch, you boo-boo, you T'd
You turned down, you thirsty
Tell 'em "Shut the fuck up!"
Tell 'em "Shut the fuck up!"
Yeah, nigga, you boo-boo, you T'd
You turned down, you thirsty
You thirsty, you boo-boo
You T, you turned down
You boo-boo, you T'd
You boo-boo, you turned down
You thirsty, you T'd
You boo-boo, you turned down
You boo-boo, you T'd
You turned down, you weak
You weak, yo' bitch weak
Yo- 
You boo-boo, you T 
Keep all that

What is HiiiPoWeR?
HiiiPoWeR is the way we think, the way we live
See it's known today that the human race is nothing
No morals, no standards
What we're about to do is raise the level of expectations
No, you don't have to have a lot of money
You don't have to be rich
But you will be rich in mind and spirit
Some say it's as big as a crew, some say it's as big as a gang
HiiiPoWeR, we stand for it as if it's as big as a religion


[Ab-Soul:]
My nigga, what it look like?

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Niggas hatin', bitches hatin', babies dyin'
Bullets flyin', helicopters, police sirens, preachers lying
Genocism, criticism, unemployment, racism
Burning buildings, AIDS victims, cancer killin' no cure
Oil spillin', turmoil, poverty-stricken, police brutality
Kickin' ass of us Africans, hostages in Afghanistan
Not to mention another prison, child molesting
Cow intestines, Botox injections, earthquakes that's government tested
Secret society weapon, opium plant manifested
Then turn to crack then invested amongst us blacks just a message
To hold us back, great depression amongst Iraq, no direction no Google map
Just a Tec for the soo-woop swerving, izuzu then blap blap blap
Adolescents go coocoo, mothers are boohoo crying
The governor keeps us starvin', these commercials keep us buyin'
These cigarettes supermarkets fill up our liver with triumph
Distincted livin' with science, no place to live in, no Zion
See that's forbidden, we fryin'
My nigga, what it look like?
That's exactly what Hell look like

[Alori Joh:]
Tell it like it is nigga, tell it like it is homeboy
Tell it like it is nigga, tell it like it is, tell them what's up!
Tell it like it is nigga, tell it like it is homeboy
Tell it like it is nigga, tell it like it is, tell them what's up!

[Ab-Soul:]
My nigga, what it look like?

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Malcolm laughing, Martin laughing, Biggie spittin'
Pac is rapping, Gregory tappin', people singing, bells is ringing
Children playing, angels praying, 14-karat golden streets, collard greens
Red wine, potato yams, turkey legs, calling every human being


[Female:]
I miss you (I miss you, I miss you)
Where you been? (Where you been?)
It's been months and I haven't heard from you, I need you
It's been months and I haven't heard from you, come back to me
Come back, I need you in my life (Come back)
I miss you, I miss you, come back to me, I miss you

[Dom Kennedy:]
What's up baby? (What's up baby?)
It's been a while (Been a while)
You been good? (Been good?)
I've been around (Uh)
Different girls (Where?)
Different towns (Yeah)
To keep it real (Keep it real)
You missing out (Uh)
I'm on board, next city (On board, next city)
Random call, text with me (Random call, uh)
Like, I missed you so much, have sex with me
Not right now, look you know I got the ex with me
She like fuck that (Fuck that)
I don't care Dom (Care Dom)
So selfish and that really isn't fair Dom (Fair Dom)
Meet me here, where Dom? (Meet me here, where Dom?)
Get undressed, yeah, Dom (Uh)
Yeah, Dom, what you need?
Some bomb head? A bag of weed? (Bomb head, yeah)
Good food? Japanese? (Yeah, yeah)
That's me on page forty in that magazine
Dom Kennedy, you need that
She said nobody come close, I agreed back (Uh)
I'm the nigga who used to help her pull that weave back (Yeah)
And she need me, believe that (Yeah)

[JaVonte:]
That girl is smoking
And can you believe that I'm her focus?
It ain't hard to see she got me open
And together, we are roller-coasting, on, on, on

[Kendrick Lamar:]
What's up love? (What's up love?)
It's been a while (Been a while)
You been good? (Been good?)
I've been around (Uh-huh)
Remember dinner dates I was late? Mr. Chows (Uh-huh)
Truant like a student, you the principal (Alright)
Schooled me on timing, we was both shining (Alright, alright)
Like the sun bouncing off the brightest blood diamond (True)
I was Your Highness, you was my queen (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
You got over him when I got in between
Watching Martin on TBS as it was tedious
For us to eat TV dinners every time we was famished
But it was such a pleasure to watch you try to hold it together
Every time I put the head in you would panic
And come right down like an avalanche
Make your legs slant, whisper 'til you juicing up your pants
Baby how that sound? Kosher, no sir
Wake it back up, Folger's holsters
By my waistline, shot for your heart
And you called it a hate crime, say you want me back
And your girl wanna date Dom, that's high school shit
401K, we could be friends with benefits, you dig that?

[JaVonte:]
That girl is smoking
And can you believe that I'm her focus?
It ain't hard to see she got me open
And together, we are roller-coasting, on, on, on

[MURS:]
I upped and walked out, now she crying 'cause
She need me, I got that Jon Brion love
Had to find love, we called it punch-drunk
We was a two-piece, she was a one-punch
You know, a knock-out, and if she was to walk out
My heart would go black, shrivel up and drop out
There we go again, what the fuck you talking 'bout?
We used to fuck all the time back at my mamma's house
Smoking beedies, laying on the futon
Memories I got saved up like a coupon
And we'd be too gone off a sack of stress weed
I was broke then, couldn't cop the best weed
Then she would just leave in a black hatchback
Homies from the hood used to ask me if I'd tapped that
I would say, "Yep," smiling so freely
That was back then, but I bet she still need me
She need me, she need me
She need me, she need me
I would say "Yes," smiling so freely
That was back then, I bet she still need me

[Javonte:]
That girl is smoking
And can you believe that I'm her focus?
It ain't hard to see she got me open
And together, we are roller-coasting, on, on, on


[Kendrick Lamar:]
The homies say I'm the truest
The bitches think I'm the cutest
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this

[Y-O:]
Now I prefer women with some sexy toes
With no corns but enjoys eating vegetables
Seem like everybody love the role of assholes
But I'm feeling better being crowned with some bad hoes
Mr. Michael of Amish yo speaking
Fedora on the top, the black Abraham Lincoln
I hear they fell in love with my penis
Only concerned with my balls like Venus

[Thurz:]
Huh, they say I'm rolling like a big shot
Kama Sutra missionary, fuck shit up on top
Say, I'm big time, Flavor Flav on a wristwatch
And all these chickens want that rooster, call it Big Cock
Co-co-co-cock that, aim and shoot that sure shot
U-N-I, T.D.E. be doing it so go head and hop
On that bandwagon of my genitals, not new to me
I'm still serving, broads on my TIP for gratuities

[Kendrick Lamar:]
The homies say I'm the truest
The bitches think I'm the cutest
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this
Bitch, I do this
Bitch, I do this
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this

[Skeme:]
Oh Lord, here he come, there they go again
Kendrick got my cover fire, bitch I'm going in
Burn a swisher up, then I roll again
Ee-Jay and Weezy, just make sure that dough keep rolling in, hah!
Got the world going crazy
Big chrome .380 if a nigga try and play me
Nigga's swag wavy, chauffeur got me car-pooling
So when it come to stunting, bitch I do it

[Brown:]
Never been like you or wanted to be, I do me
She found out that I'm in a group, now she's a groupie
Don't need a watch that's full of diamonds to know that it's perfect timing
We be shining blue and brown and got that golden Gucci
Yeah, keep it simple stupid, all I see is trendy all around me
T.D.E. the movement, we Sore Losers out of Dallas County
Country accent, city fashion, lights are flashing on the cameras
Hoes are choosing, niggas' hating, we ain't tripping, keep our balance

[Kendrick Lamar:]
The homies say I'm the truest
The bitches think I'm the cutest
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this
Bitch, I do this
Bitch, I do this
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this

These hoes want to love me, man
So I'm like, what up? Uh what up?
Uh, bitch I do this remix stupid, fire burning, people looting
That's the chaos, comes from K. Dot swinging swords and hanging nooses
Chucking deuces, then drop one, dropping music and I won
Call me hot or call me Pac, every eye on me and it's obviously
I'm close as next to kingdom come, I just run my city dude
You just make your city run, they hate to be next to you
Tables turn, say you earn rights to be the God MC
I'm 'bout to make that halo burn, now goddamn that's some irony
I am the messiah of society
Beside a Halle Berry, feed me berries in Paris, oui-oui
I carry on a great endeavor, ambition leave all men grief
Like beliefs of Mason Betha, reporting from C-P-T motherfucker

Bitch, I do this
Bitch, I do this
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this


Gather 'round
I'm glad everybody came out tonight
As we stand on our neighborhood corner
Know that this fire that's burning represents the passion you have
Listen
Keisha, Tammy, come up front
I recognize all of you
Every creed and color
With that being said
Fuck your ethnicity
You understand that?
We gon' talk about a lot of shit that concerns you, all of you

[Alori Joh:]
Now everybody, throw your hands up high
If you don't give a fuck, throw your hands up high
Throw your hands up high

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Now, I don't give a fuck if you
Black, white, Asian, Hispanic, goddammit
That don't mean shit to me
Fuck your ethnicity, nigga

Fire burning inside my eyes, this the music that saved my life
Y'all be calling it hip-hop, I be calling it hypnotize
Yeah, hypnotize, trapped my body, but freed my mind
What the fuck are you fighting for? Ain't nobody gon' win that war
My details be retail, man, I got so much in store
Racism is still alive, yellow tape and colored lines
Fuck that, nigga, look at that line, it's so diverse
They gettin' off work and they wanna see Kendrick
Everybody can't drive Benzes, and I been there, so I make it my business
To give 'em my full attention, ten-hut, man, I gotta get my wind up
Man, I gotta get down with God 'cause I got my sins up, ooh
Matter fact, don't mistake me for no fuckin' rapper
They sit backstage and hide behind them fuckin' cameras
I mosh pit, had a microphone and I tossed it
Had a brain, then I lost it
I'm out of my mind, so don't you mind how much the cost is
Penny for my thoughts, everybody, please hold up your wallets
Yeah, man, I'm the mailman, can't you tell, man?
Gone postal, never freeze up when I approach you
That's starstruck and roast you, oh my
HiiiPower

Reporting live from Planet Terminator X
I saw Martin Luther King with an AK-47

Now, I don't give a fuck if you
Black, white, Asian, Hispanic, goddammit
That don't mean shit to me
Fuck your ethnicity, nigga

I'm tired of y'all, 'cause everybody lied to y'all
And you believe it? Recognize them false achievements
It's treason and I'm Tylenol, I knock out when you knock it off
Knock on the doors of opportunity, I'm too involved
I'm no activist, I'm no Einstein
Before calculus, I was kicking that math
Dropping that science like an alchemist and I be kicking that ass
Lyrically, I'm UFC
If a UFO had came for me, I'ma come back with the head of an alien
Don't alienate my dreams
Get it right, get a life, I got two
That's a metaphor for the big shit I do
Boy, TMI, TSA, man, I'm fly
Put wings on my back
That a plane or an angel? Both
Like a pilot with a halo, whoa
Gross

I mean, I've seen so many things come through them, him, her, you, mm, mm, mm, mm
I'm just a messenger
Yeah, I know life's a bitch, get the best of her
Put them threes up, they notice that we up
HiiiPower and the power in the people and if they don't believe us
They'll die
Wizard

Now, I don't give a fuck if you
Black, white, Asian, Hispanic, goddammit
That don't mean shit to me
Fuck your ethnicity, nigga


I wrote this record while thirty thousand feet in the air
Stewardess complimenting me on my nappy hair
If I can fuck her in front of all of these passengers
They'll probably think I'm a terrorist, eat my asparagus
Then I'm asking her thoughts of a young nigga
Fast money and freedom, a crash dummy for dollars
I know you dying to meet him, I'll probably die in a minute
Just bury me with twenty bitches, twenty million, and a Comptown fitted

Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Yeah, big shit poppin'
Section.80

Back in this bitch, in the back of that bitch
With my back against the wall and your bitch on the edge of my dick, jump off
I call a bitch a bitch, a ho a ho, a woman a woman
I never did nothing but break the ground on top of the asphalt
Tire mark gave you evidence that I'm easily peddlin'
With the speed of a lightning bolt
As a kid, I killed two adults, I'm too advanced
I lived my twenties at two years old, the wiser man
Truth be told, I'm like eighty-seven
Wicked as eighty reverends in a pool of fire with devils holding hands
From a distance, don't know which one is a Christian, damn
Who can I trust in 2012? There's no one, not even myself
A Gemini screaming for help, somebody

Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Yeah, big shit poppin', everybody watchin'
When you do it like this, nigga, losing ain't a option
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Yeah, big shit poppin'
Ayy, ayy, kick her out the studio, Ali

24/7, nigga working his ass for it, she poppin' that ass for
The King of Diamonds with diamonds, I never do ask for it
They checkin' my passport, I'm too accustomed with customs
You callin' the task force, I killed it, somebody cuff him
They want me to fast forward the game, and
Why you complain when you niggas is past poor?
You'll never hop in my lane when you pushing a RAV4
You wrecking my Jaguar
You play like a bad sport
Her feet on the dashboard

Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Yeah, big shit poppin', everybody watchin'
When you do it like this, nigga, losing ain't an option
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Yeah, big shit poppin', everybody watchin'
When you do it like this, nigga

I wrote this record while thirty thousand feet in the air
Stewardess complimenting me on my nappy hair
If I can fuck her in front of all of these passengers
They'll probably think I'm Osama
The plane emergency landed, it was an honor
Hol' up


[Kendrick Lamar:]
Uh-uh, fuck that

Eight doobies to the face, fuck that
Twelve bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that
Two pills and a half-weight, nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerance when your age don't exist

Man, I swear my nigga trippin' off that shit again
Pick him up, then I set him in cold water
Then I order someone to bring him Vicodin
Hope that take the pain away
From the feelin' that he feel today
You know when you part of Section.80
You feel like no one can relate
'Cause you are, you are, a loner, loner
Marijuana endorphins make you stronger, stronger
I'm in the house party trippin' off
My generation sippin' cough syrup like it's water
Never no pancakes in the kitchen
Man, not one of our lives is caught up
In the daily superstition that the world is 'bout to end
Who gives a fuck? We never do listen
'Less it comes with an 808 (A melody and some hoes)
PlayStation and some drank (Technology bought my soul)
Lookin' around and all I see is a big crowd that's product of me
And they probably relatives relevant for a rebel's dream
Yep, her president is black, she black too
Purple Label on her back, but that tab is light blue
She take it straight to the head, then she look at me
She got ADHD

Eight doobies to the face, fuck that
Twelve bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that
Two pills and a half-weight, nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerance when your age don't exist

Like whoa-whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa, whoa (Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
Whoa-whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa, whoa (Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
(They always told me ADHD did it)
Whoa, whoa-whoa

And then she started
And then she started feelin' herself like no one else in this apartment
"Beg your pardon? Oh, I rap, baby, how old are you?"
She say twenty-two, I say twenty-three, "OK, then we are crack babies," damn
"Why you say that?" She said, "Where my drink at?"
"I'ma tell you later. Just tell your neighbors and the police 'Relax'."
I stood up, shut the blind, closed the screen, Jumbotron
Made to the back where she reside, then she said, "Read between the lines," yep
Hope that I get close enough when the lights turn down
And the fact that she just might open up when the Nuvo start to drown
Her body, and I know the both of us really deep in the mood now
It's nothin' we can do now, somebody walked in with a pound (Whoa)
Of that Bay Area kush, she looked at me, then looked
At it, then she grabbed it, then she said, "Get it understood"
"You know why we crack babies? Because we born in the '80s
The ADHD crazy"

Eight doobies to the face, fuck that
Twelve bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that
Two pills and a half-weight, nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerance when your age don't exist

Like whoa-whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa, whoa (Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
Whoa-whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa, whoa (Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
(They always told me ADHD did it)
Whoa, whoa-whoa

[Ab-Soul:]
You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light
Double cup, deuce, four, six, just mix it in Sprite
Ecstasy, 'shrooms, blow, 'dro, hoes, whatever you like
You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light


[Colin Munroe:]
I love the way you put it on your eyes
The roses on your face light up the sky
Those lips are colorful all of the time
And girl, that's fine, but I wanna know, do you mind?
No makeup today, no makeup today, today
No makeup today, no makeup today
And girl, that's fine, but I wanna know, do you mind?

[Kendrick Lamar:]
I know she 'bout to ask me how she look
I tell her beautiful and how long it took
For you to put it on, it was early in the morn'
She resembled a model out of a MAC book
Concentrating on the way the eyeliner thickens
I stand behind her and try to figure her vision
Of prettiness, the wittiness of colors on her skin tone
Her complexion in a direction I've outgrown
Damn girl, why so much?
You 'bout to blow your cover when you cover up
Don't you know your imperfections is a wonderful blessing?
From Heaven is where you got it from
I love your smile, you can do it without style
From your lips all the way to your eyebrows
It's the beauty in her, but when the makeup occur
I don't see it, all I see is a blur

[Colin Munroe:]
I love the way you put it on your eyes
The roses on your face light up the sky
Those lips are colorful all of the time
And girl, that's fine, but I wanna know, do you mind?
No makeup today, no makeup today, today
No makeup today, no makeup today
And girl, that's fine, but I wanna know, do you mind?

[Kendrick Lamar:]
I know she 'bout to ask me how she look
I tell her beautiful and how long it took
For you to put it on, it was early in the morn'
She resembled a model out of a MAC book

[Alori Joh (Kendrick Lamar):]
Concentrating on the way my eyeliner thickens
He stand behind me and try to figure her vision
Of prettiness, the wittiness of colors on my skin tone
My complexion in a direction I've outgrown
I feel like it's not enough
I can never put on too much makeup
Yeah, I know your imperfections, I be constantly stressing
From him is where I get it from, they tell me I need to
Smile at least once in a while
I hate my lips, my nose, my eyebrows
It's the beauty in me, but what he don't see
Is that I had a black eye—(to be continued, eleven)

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Ladies and gentlemen
And you ain't gotta get drunk to have fun
You ain't gotta get drunk to have fun
And you ain't gotta get drunk to have fun
You ain't gotta get drunk to have fun

[Colin Munroe:]
I love the way you put it on your eyes
The roses on your face light up the sky
Those lips are colorful all of the time
And girl, that's fine, but I wanna know, do you mind?
No makeup today, no makeup today, today
No makeup today, no makeup today
And girl, that's fine, but I wanna know, do you mind?


Don't judge me

I know this girl, she a real good girl and she be low-key
Looking like a star with a real nice car, a Mercedes key
And she got a nigga and she love this nigga, well, at least I think
Every time we bark, she pay us no mind in the middle of the street
She be like

Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my nigga
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my nigga
Fuck them other niggas, I'll ride for my nigga
I'll die for my nigga, fuck them other—

Until one day, he wasn't acting right
In the middle of the night, she checked his phone, Erica, right?
When he pled the Fifth, man, it was on, matter fact, she gone
Matter fact, Tyrone was on speed dial, so when she got home
It was going down, she go

Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Sick of lies from her nigga, fuck that other—

I know this girl, she a real hood girl, and she with the shit
Keep her hair tied up, big bamboos, Mike Jordan kicks
With that big butt, but when I try to holla, she gon' resist
In her man, she trust, so when I walk by her, she be screaming this
She be like

Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my nigga
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my nigga
Fuck them other niggas, I'll ride for my nigga
I'll die for my nigga, fuck them other—

Until one day, he wasn't acting right
In the middle of the night, she checked his pockets, found condoms by
Magnum, and the moment they was acknowledged, she popped his eye
Then ran outside, then started drivin' on the passenger side
Homeboy was smiling, she gon'

Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Sick of lies from her nigga, fuck that other—

And so these girls, these vulnerable girls
Took their men up, put 'em in their world, their vulnerable world
And just like that, it was only gettin', got their feelings hurt
Tell me how that sound? They got fed up with the biggest question mark
They're curious now
'Cause when women get sick of men, they think of a big helping hand
To lend each other, uncover emotions when lights dim
So when she telling her to come over, it'll be alright
The minute she hit the block and turn left, she'll be turning dyke, they go

Fuck with other bitches when they're tired of these niggas
Fuck with other bitches when they're tired of these niggas
Fuck with other bitches on the side 'cause these niggas—

Tammy's song


Ridin' with them boys and girls and we're high
All we want to do is have a good time
Young, wild, and reckless is how we live life
Pray that we make it to twenty-one (One, one, one, one)
Oh, oh, we make it to twenty-one (One, one, one, one, one, one, one)
Ridin' with them boys and girls and we're high
All we want to do is have a good time
Young, wild, and reckless is how we live life
Pray that we make it to twenty-one (One, one, one, one)
Oh, oh, we make it to twenty-one (One, one, one, one, one, one, one)

I'm glad we was able to talk about her vice and her evils
There is an even more important topic I'd like to discuss
The dysfunctional bastards of the Ronald Reagan era
Young men that learned to do everything spiteful
This is your generation
Live fast and die young
Who's willing to explain this story?

Ridin' with them boys and girls and we're high
All we want to do is have a good time
Young, wild, and reckless is how we live life
Pray that we make it to twenty-one (One, one, one, one)
Oh, oh, we make it to twenty-one (One, one, one, one, one, one, one)
Ridin' with them boys and girls and we're high
All we want to do is have a good time
Young, wild, and reckless is how we live life
Pray that we make it to twenty-one (One, one)


[Ash Riser:]
We're far from good, not good from far
Ninety miles per hour down Compton Boulevard
With the top down, screamin', "We don't give a fuck"
Drink my forty-ounce of freedom while I roll my blunt
'Cause the kids just ain't alright

[Ab-Soul:]
Oh shit, nigga
Somethin' 'bout to happen
Nigga, this shit, nigga, this sound like thirty keys under the Compton court building
Hope the dogs don't smell it

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Welcome to vigilante, '80s, so don't you ask me
I'm hungry, my body's antsy, I rip through your fuckin' pantry
Peelin' off like a Xanny, examine my orchestra
Granny said when I'm old enough, I'll be sure to be all I can be
You niggas Marcus Camby, washed up
Pussy, fix your panties, I'm Mr. Marcus, you gettin' fucked, uh
You ain't heard nothin' harder since Daddy Kane
Take it in vain, Vicodins couldn't ease the pain
Lightning bolts hit your body, you thought it rained
Not a cloud in sight, just the shit that I write
Strong enough to stand in front of a travelin' freight train, are you trained?
To go against Dracula, draggin' the record industry by my fangs
AK clips, money clips, and gold chains
You walk around with a P90 like it's the '90s
Bullet to your temple, your homicide'll remind me

[Kendrick Lamar (RZA):]
That Compton Crip niggas ain't nothin' to fuck with
Bompton Pirus ain't nothin' to fuck with
Compton éses ain't nothin' to fuck with
But they fuck with me, and bitch, I love it
Woop-di-woop, woop-di-woop-woop, woop-di-woop
Woop-di-woop, woop-di-woop-woop (California Dungeons)
Woop-di-woop, woop-di-woop-woop, woop-di-woop
Woop-di-woop, woop-di-woop-woop (California Dungeons)

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Let's hit the county buildin', gotta cash my check
Spend it all on a forty-ounce to the neck
And in retrospect, I remember December being the hottest
Squad cars, neighborhood wars, and stolen Mazdas
I tell you motherfuckers that life is full of hydraulics
Up and down, get a six-four, better know how to drive it
I'm drivin' on E with no license or registration
Heart racin', racin' past Johnny because he's racist
1987, the children of Ronald Reagan
Rake the leaves off your front porch with a machine blowtorch (I'm really out here, my nigga)
He blowin' on stress, hopin' to ease the stress (Like, really out here)
He coppin' some blow, hopin' that it can stretch
Newborn massacre
Hoppin' out the passenger with calendars 'cause your day comin'
Run him down and then he gun him down, I'm hopin' that you fast enough
Even the legs of Michael Johnson don't mean nothin', because

[Kendrick Lamar (RZA):]
Compton Crip niggas ain't nothin' to fuck with

Compton éses ain't nothin' to fuck with

Can't detour when you at war with your city, why run for it?
Just ride with me, just die with me, that gun store right there
When you fight, don't fight fair, 'cause you'll never win
(Right, I had the yopper, and I tore they ass up)
Can't detour when you at war with your city, why run for it?
Just ride with me, just die with me, that gun store right there
When you fight, don't fight fair, 'cause you'll never win, yeah, yeah, yeah

Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good

I used to want to see the penitentiary way after elementary
Thought it was cool to look the judge in the face when he sentenced me
Since my uncles was institutionalized
My intuition had said I was suited for family ties
My mama is stressin', my daddy tired
I need me a weapon, these niggas ride
Every minute, hour, and second, ministers tried to save me
How I'm gon' listen when I don't even hear God?
Heaven or Hell, base it all on my instincts
My hands dirty, you worried 'bout mud in your sink
You like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga
The same nigga that kill with you'll squeal with you
I deal with you like my son, stare at the sun
And you'll be looking in my eyes, homie
Stand for something or fall for anything
And you working with two left feet at the skating rink
But anyway, this for my niggas
Uncles, twenty-three hours, sendin' me pictures
I want you to know that I'm so determined to blow
That you hear the music I wrote, hope it get you off death row
You came home to a pocket full of stones
A Metro PC phone, then you went back in
So when I touch the pen, the pen is in my view
I'ma get it right, just so you

Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good

[GLC:]
And I do this for the city
Got some Hennessy and my real niggas with me
Fuck the police, they gon' have to come and get me
If it feel good to you, holler if you hear me

[Kendrick Lamar:]
You like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga
The same nigga that kill with you'll squeal with you
I'd like to start it out from the bottom and build with you
Be on my last dollar and split the bill with you
I'm twenty-three with morals and plans of living cordial
Not rich, but wealthy, there's nothing you can tell me
My killings are not remorseful
The city got my back, and for that, I give them my torso
You think about it and don't call me lyrical
'Cause really I'm just a nigga that's evil and spiritual
I know some rappers using big words to make their similes curve
My simplest shit be more pivotal
I penetrate the hearts of good kids and criminals
Worrisome individuals that live life critical
So won't you bear witness while I bare feet?
So you can walk in my shoes and get to know me
But anyway, this for my pops
On his lunch break eating in that parking lot
On "Wanna Be Heard," probably thought he worked my nerves
But really he was stressing me gettin' what I deserve
Somebody said my name on the radio
He ain't know I was ready for the world that minute
So the next time he roll up and drop grams in it
He probably be out of work, laid back, while he

Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good

[GLC:]
And I do this for the city
Got some Hennessy and my real niggas with me
Fuck the police, they gon' have to come and get me
If it feel good to you, holler if you hear me

Church is definitely on the move and now we done took it up to the cathedral
'Cause the ism is enormous, you know what I'm talking 'bout?
We out here rotating under the five Ps
Proper preparation prevents poor performance, you know what I'm talking 'bout?
Doing my thing 'cause I'm rotating with my speakers thumping
From the Windy City streets all the way out here to the streets of Compton
Know what I'm talking 'bout?
Church is definitely on the move and we gon' continue to hustle and grow and develop by far
As I rotate with my true player partner by the name of Kendrick Lamar, you know what I'm talking 'bout?
This is the ism, this is the vision, you know what I'm talking 'bout?
Gotta get up off your ass and get it, man
That's the only way your pockets gon' expand
I tell you everyday, you know what I'm talking 'bout?
Apply yourself to supply your wealth
Only limitations you'll ever have are those that you place upon yourself
Church is definitely on the move, you know what I'm talking 'bout?
Exercise your ism, and don't depend on no one else
Cathedral, church, ism


[Kendrick Lamar:]

Nigga, I'm faded off of that Nuvo, chilling with two hoes in here
And they tie my laces, living the Matrix as them pills disappear
Me and my niggas just acting bad HiiiPower conglomerate
Living that life and counting this cash old friends I no longer have

I know a lot of people that smile in my face
But talk behind my back every time I'm gone
So when they call my number, I don't never pick up
I don't owe you shit, bitch, leave me alone
I'm going big, suck my dick

[ScHoolboy Q & Kendrick Lamar:]
I remember when I came out and shit
Man, it's been so long since they see my dick
Probably been five months since I seen my seed
Goddammit, K. Dot, when it come to this?
When I was sleeping on couches
Nigga couldn't get a call, just a Glock for my vouch
Nigga I was motherfuckin' out, yeah
With the flashing lights had me stuck like reindeer
When I should have been making bank, yeah
I was somewhere stuck where the flame is
Motherfucker, see how far that I came here
Went broke and I came up in the same year, can I get a hell yeah?
Drop my tear, hold my joy, show my pride
Music saved my fucking life, I'm doing right and you left behind
Feel my pain, now I'm styling, Hermès shit, I spent a thousand
Different homes, different islands
Dropped my mixtape and it sold like an album

[Kendrick Lamar & ScHoolboy Q:]
Reason why I'm be going big, bitch, suck my dick
Yeah, I'm going big, bitch, suck my dick
Tell 'em I'm going big, bitch, suck my dick
Yeah, I'm going big, bitch, suck my dick (Yeah)

You acting like a hoe, you acting like a hoe
You acting like a hoe, niggas acting like a hoe
Like hoes, like hoes, like hoes, like hoes


[JaVonté:]
In time, you'll learn this is about you
In time, you'll learn this is about you
In time, you'll learn this is about you

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Babies from '80s don't know, know no better
Don't nothing go better with ignorance but the belligerent kids that we living with
Some of them masculine, some of them feminine
'Member the universe used to be innocent?
Now they just look at us crazy like immigrants
Every day that I wake up, I'ma sin again
I'm not a citizen, I'm just a nigga from Section.80

Show of hands, how many been taking notes?
Good
Leave everything on the table now
Vulnerability
This is your generation
Show, show your pain


[Ash Riser:]
Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard
Flagging down all of these flashy cars

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Uh, and Lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
She take the little change she make to fix her nail cuticles
Lipstick is suitable to make you fiend for more
She play Mr. Shakur, that's her favorite rapper
Bumpin' "Brenda's Got a Baby" while a pervert yellin' at her
And she capture features of a woman, but only seventeen
Then seven cars start honking
She start running like Flo-Jo, don't care if they Joe Blow
If they got money to blow, a blow job is a sure go
And sure enough, don't see a dime of dirty dollars
Just give it all to her daddy, but she don't know her father
That's ironic
See, a block away from Lueders Park, I seen an El Camino parked
And in her heart, she hate it there, but in her mind, she made it where
Nothin' really matters, so she hit the back seat
Rosa Parks never a factor when she makin' ends meet

[Ash Riser:]
Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard
Flagging down all of these flashy cars

[Kendrick Lamar:]
And Lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
Her anatomy is God's temple
And it's quite simple, her castle is 'bout to be destroyed
She's always paranoid, watching the law inside the streets
Under covers, the dummies that look like decoys
Remember sergeant let her slide
Said if he seen what's between her thighs, he'd compromise
To no surprise
She took the ultimatum 'round the alleyway and gave him
A warm welcome, then felt him right below the navel
Though he was wired up like a pair of jumping cables
His eyes was closed shut, prior charges, he had waived 'em
It was a block away from Lueders Park, I seen a squad car parked
And in her heart, she hate it there, but in her mind, she made it where
Nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat
'Cause Rosa Parks never a factor when she toppin' off police

[Ash Riser:]
Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard
Flagging down all of these flashy cars

[Kendrick Lamar:]
And Lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
As she bust down like a twelve-bunk on tour
She suddenly realize she'll never escape the allure
Of a black man, white man needing satisfaction
At first, it became a practice, but now she's numb to it
Sometimes she wonder if she can do it like nuns do it
But she never heard of Catholic religion or sinner's redemption, that sounds foolish
And you can blame it on her mother
For letting her boyfriend slide candy under her cover
Ten months before she was ten, he moved in and that's when he touched her
This motherfucker is the fuckin' reason why Keisha rushing to that
Block away from Lueders Park, I seen an El Camino parked
And in her heart, she hate it there, but in her mind, she made it where
Nothing really matters, still she hit the back seat
Then caught a knife inside the bladder, left for dead, raped in the street
Keisha's song, mm
My little sister eleven, I looked her right in the face
The day that I wrote this song, sat her down and pressed play

[Ash Riser:]
Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard
Flagging down all of these flashy cars
Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard, oh
Flagging down all of these flashy cars


Alright, here we go, third take
Real quick, Ali
Mm

Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson with madness
Now just imagine the magic I light to asses
Don't ask for your favorite rapper
(He dead), yes, sir (Amen), church
(He dead), I killed him (Amen), bitch

And this is rigor mortis and it's gorgeous when you die
Ali recorded and I'm Morpheus, the matrix of my mind
I'm out the orbit, you an orphan and a hairdresser combined
I'm on the toilet when I rhyme, if you the shit, then I decline
I climax where you begin and then I end on cloud nine
And that's important when you morph into an angel in the sky
And don't be forging all my signatures, my listeners reply
And tell me that you biting style, you got a hell of an appetite
And I'ma be here for a while, just buckle up before the ride
Or knuckle up if you can fight, we always making 'em duck or die
A suit and tie is suitable and usual in suicide
CSI just might investigate this fucking parasite
(He dead, amen)
That's what they telling me
Aim it at your celebrity, this is studio felony
Ferragami so many and cool enough for the '70s
Nigga, payback's a bitch, and bitch, you been livin' in debt with me
Dead 'em all and especially
Leave a call on his mother voicemail that say that he rest in peace
Bigger chopper the recipe
Wrestling? That's irrelevant, rather rest at your residence
Whistling to the melody, couldn't think of a better D
Better be on your P and Q, it's just me, Jay Rock, Soul, and Q
Solar system and barbecue, nothing else you can do

(He dead), yup-yup (Amen), I killed him
(He dead, amen), amen
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper
(He dead), yup-yup (Amen), I know
(He dead), for sure (Amen), amen
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper

I wrapped him and made him Casper, I capture the likes of NASA
My pedigree to fly past ya, I'll pass the weed to the pastor
We all are sinners, won't you send us to Bible study faster?
Your hypocritist reaction a blasphemy, I assassin my casualty
And it's casually done, and tell 'em my salary come
In lump sum one hundreds, don't talk to me 'bout no money
The sun is under my feet, and I come in peace to compete
I don't run if you'd rather leap, my statistics go up in weeks
And I go visit the nearest creek, and I get busy on many MC
Really ballistic, anybody can see
Any assistance, everybody deceased
Some persistence, recognize I be
Really too vicious, the permanent beast
And the demolition breaking up the street
Better partition, better dot your T
And I gon' mention how the far you see
Putting my dick in the rap industry
Everybody bitching, getting mad at me
Recognize Kendrick in the battery
And I'm charged up, and the catastrophe
Is charged up, and the audacity
Of y'all fucks never could hassle me
And y'all luck just ran out, you'll see

(He dead), yup-yup (Amen), I know
(He dead), for sure (Amen), amen
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper
(He dead), yup-yup (Amen), I know
(He dead), for sure (Amen), amen


[Kendrick Lamar:]
Check, check, check, check, check

It go ride to it, ride to it, 'cause you never know
When a bullet might hit and you die to it, die to it
Die to it, die to it, live your life, live it right
Be different, do different things
Don't do it like he did, 'cause he ain't what you is
But we can win, wait, let's get straight to the point

To the meaning of life, what's my purpose?
Maybe this Earth is ain't a good place to be
How far is heaven? Let's see
Is it in the clouds like they said it would be?
I wonder when I die will he give me receipts?
I wonder will the eyes of the Lord look at me?
Look at me, look at me, I'm a loser, I'm a winner
I'm good, I'm bad, I'm a Christian, I'm a sinner
I'm humble, I'm loud, I'm righteous, I'm a killer
What I'm doing? I'm saying that I'm human, now people just

Ride to it, ride to it, 'cause you never know
When a bullet might hit and you die to it, die to it
Die to it, die to it, live your life, live it right
Be different, do different things
Don't do it like he did, 'cause he ain't what you is
But we can win, wait, let's get straight to the point

It go one (One), two (Two), three (Three)
Two in the front, one in the back seat (Seat)
Seat (Seat), seat (Seat), seat (Seat)
Looking for a victim of a AK-47, hundred-round each, each, each
But why must we retaliate? Is it human nature?
I don't know, I look for the answers later
"Make a right, there they go" (There they go)
Sometimes gotta

Ride to it, ride to it, 'cause you never know
When a bullet might hit and you die to it, die to it
Die to it, die to it, live your life, live it right
Be different, do different things
Don't do it like he did, 'cause he ain't what you is
But we can win-win, wait, let's get straight to the point

As I open this book and then burn up some of this reefer
My plan is to figure out the world and escape all my demons
I'm dying inside, I wonder if Zion inside the heavens
A condom, a Rollie, pain, a fat blunt and a MAC-11
That's all I see in my life and they tell me to make it right
But I'm right on the edge of Everest and I might jump tonight
Have you ever had known a saint that was taking sinner's advice?
Well it's probably you, am I right? If I'm wrong, you a fucking liar
When I lie on my back and look at the ceiling, it's so appealing to pray
I wonder if I'm just a villain, dealing my morals away
Some people look at my face then tell me don't worry 'bout it
I give 'em back their deposit, no money, just total silence
I'm running, they say I'm wildin', a youngin' with lack of guidance
That's hundreds of us with problems
Mo' money, mo' drugs and violence
Look at the soul of an out-of-control artist
That's dealing with life the hardest, that's on my life
But regardless I'ma—

[Kendrick Lamar (BJ the Chicago Kid):]
Ride to it, ride to it, 'cause I never know
When a bullet might hit me and I die to it, die to it
Die to it, die to it, live my life, live it right
Be different, do different things
Don't do it like he did, 'cause he ain't what I is
But we can win, wait, let's get straight to the point
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Hmm

[BJ the Chicago Kid:]
Yeah, life can please ya, but death can tease ya
On the day Niko had that seizure
I lost one of my biggest believers, aw
Close deaths make you think about your life
Like if I had that same chance twice, what would I do different?
I'd tell her I loved her more, do more
But tease her 'bout crying on that picture
Now when I'm done recording
Swear, I let the beat bang in her name
Make her shake her head in heaven, saying, "They're at it again"
Make them clouds turn to speakers
Don't take too much smoke from the reefer
Love being in the room with her peoples
Now my love life murking it, family having surgeries
Hate it that the truth that chose for their life to be under me
Lord, what kind of life is this?
Mamma, I just wanna sing
Mamma said, "According to get everything" (Uh)
"You gotta risk everything"
So I'm smoking my kush, reading Corinthians
Smoking my kush, reading Corinthians
Smoking my kush, reading Corinthians (Corinthians)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Smoking my kush, reading Corinthians (Corinthians, Corinthians, Corinthians)

Mm, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Da, da, da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da, da, da
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Da, da, da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da-da-da


[Kendrick Lamar:]
Smoking out, pouring up, keep that lean up in my cup
All my car got leather and wood, in my hood we call it buck
Everybody wanna ball, holla at broads at the mall
If he up, watch him fall, I can't fuck with y'all
Pussy-ass, ho niggas (Niggas), I can't fuck with y'all
Bitches all up in my business (Business), I can't fuck with y'all
Industry of counterfeits (Counterfeits), I can't fuck with y'all

Taking off when you landing
Bitch niggas gonna throw tantrums
And I'm dancing on them stars
The galaxy ain't got room for y'all
Ain't nothing gonna happen soon for y'all
While I'm here and every day I hear
Your bullshit, self-pity
Reason why you never dealt with me
Reason why your girl dealt with me
Hands up, in the building, we get busy and say

R.I.P. Aaliyah, R.I.P., yep
R.I.P. Aaliyah, R.I.P., yep
That's exactly what this sound like
A to the A to the L-I-Y-A-H, give it up two times
Then give it right back, don't blow my high

Smoking out, pouring up, keep that lean up in my cup
All my car got leather and wood, in my hood we call it buck
Everybody wanna ball, holla at broads at the mall
If he up, watch him fall, I can't fuck with y'all
Pussy-ass, ho niggas (Niggas), I can't fuck with y'all
Bitches all up in my business (Business), I can't fuck with y'all
Industry of counterfeits (Counterfeits), I can't fuck with y'all

Look at my life then look at yours
Get some ambition, why you bored?
Time'll never wait on no man
Society will never hold your hand
Niggas like to gossip like bitches
Got me thinking you don't like bitches
Wonder what's behind them Ray Bans?
Eyes of a coward, I understand
Niggas like to gossip like bitches
Sip Dom Pérignon, when we finish, we say

R.I.P. Aaliyah, R.I.P., yep
R.I.P. Aaliyah, R.I.P., yep
That's exactly what this sound like
But never will I ever forget Left Eye
Roll up, put a ribbon in the sky
And a button on your lips, don't blow my high

Smoking out, pouring up, keep that lean up in my cup
All my car got leather and wood, in my hood we call it buck
Everybody wanna ball, holla at broads at the mall
If he up, watch him fall, I can't fuck with y'all
Pussy-ass, ho niggas (Niggas), I can't fuck with y'all
Bitches all up in my business (Business), I can't fuck with y'all
Industry of counterfeits (Counterfeits), I can't fuck with y'all

[Kendrick Lamar (Aaliyah):]
Now everybody sing this shit
(I'm sending him a four-page letter)
(And I enclosed it with a kiss (A kiss))
(And when I write him, he better)
(Get it on time)
Look at my life, and look at yours
Get some ambition why you bored

[Kendrick Lamar:]
R.I.P. Aaliyah, R.I.P
R.I.P. Aaliyah, R.I.P
R.I.P. Aaliyah, R.I.P
R.I.P. Aaliyah, R.I.P


[Ab-Soul (Alori Joh) {Kendrick Lamar}:]
What's your life about? Enlighten me
Is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?
It's fire in the street, fire in my Swisher
Fire in between the two legs of your little sister
Just get a sip of this elixir
Before they crop us out the picture
I've never seen a crop circle
But I seen cops circle the block
I puff squares, but I swear, one day, I'ma stop
My nerves itch
On the brink of my career
While my peers struggle for employment
Can you hear these screams?
{Uncle Sam ain't no kin to me}
One, two, three, four grams and a fifth of Hennessy
A bad bitch, fuck the penitentiary
(Section 80s babies, blame Ronald Reagan)
(We raising hell, hell (Oh))
Lord forbid, the homies got wet, so we trying to soak it in
The president is Black, but you can't vote for skin
You vote for the better man
Come to our show, you could see the diversity
Unify the people, they gon' peep it universally
We might not change the world
But we gon' manipulate it, I hope you participatin'
Ayo, Dot, won't you let these cats know?
We knew we'd be here, like, back in '04
Started HiiiPower because our generation needed a generator
In a system meant to disintegrate us (Ooh)
And all we do is assist them
We're not victors, we're victims
The bigger picture isn't developed yet
Like, what if Keisha was celibate?
Or what if Tammy came across a real man
Who didn't play games like children?
My nigga cheated on his girlfriend
With his girlfriend's girlfriend, let the world end
And everybody tripping off 2012
And the extraterrestrial presence as well
Odd Future's aight
But our future is not
That martial law shit drop, we gon' all get got
So keep that question mark on your face
Eat your fast food, use your fluoride toothpaste
Hide your feelings from the public, work your little nine-to-five
Don't forget to pay your tithes and thank God you're alive
{HiiiPower}
And on another note
We focused like the Hubble Telescope
Soul

[Kendrick Lamar (Alori Joh):]
Life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam
(Life is a traffic jam)
Life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam
Life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam
(I'm ready to go, ready to go)
Life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam
(Ready to go, ready to go)
Life is a traffic jam
(Life)

[Kendrick Lamar (Ab-Soul):]
I wrote this because I was ordered to
People say I speak for generation Y
Why lie? I do, Section.80
Your son'll play me if radio won't
Daughters that just turn one 'til twenty-one listen to Kendrick
For instance
(What's your life about? Enlighten me)
(Is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?)
(Take out that student loan, and pay off your college degree)
(And do exactly what you see on TV)
True story
Hmm
Can you repeat that for me, Soul?
(What's your life about? Enlighten me)
(Is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?)
(Is you gon' plead the fifth or sound the horn?)
(The time is now, my child, come on)
See, a lot of y'all don't understand Kendrick Lamar
Because you wonder how I could talk about money, hoes, clothes, God, and history all in the same sentence
You know what all them things have in common?
Only half of the truth, if you tell it
See I spent twenty-three years on this earth searching for answers
'Til one day I realized I had to come up with my own
I'm not on the outside looking in
I'm not on the inside looking out
I'm in the dead fucking center, looking around
You ever seen a newborn baby kill a grown man?
That's an analogy for the way the world make me react
My innocence been dead
So, the next time I talk about money, hoes, clothes, God, and history all in the same sentence
Just know I meant it, and you felt it
'Cause you too are searching for answers
I'm not the next pop star, I'm not the next socially-aware rapper
I am a human motherfuckin' being over dope-ass instrumentation
Kendrick Lamar
Now fuck 'em up, Terrace
(Soul)

[Kendrick Lamar:]
I watch this fire that we're gathered around
And see that it burns similar to the fire that's inside you
Section.80
Section.80 babies
A generation of bliss and disobedience
No, they can't control us
No, they can't control you
No, they can't control us
But we can control each other
We build our own world
If you don't leave with nothing else tonight
You will leave with knowing yourself
You will leave knowing that you represent something that's bigger than all of us
Our family
Heart, honor, and respect
This is you
This is me
And we are HiiiPower


[Kendrick Lamar:]
Everybody put three fingers in the air
The sky is falling, the wind is calling
Stand for something or die in the morning
Section.80, HiiiPoWeR

Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
Malcolm X put a hex on my future, someone catch me
I'm falling victim to a revolutionary song, the Serengeti's clone
Back to put you backstabbers back on your spinal bone
You slipped your disc when I slid you my disc
You wanted to diss, but jumped on my dick
Grown men never should bite their tongue
Unless you eatin' pussy that smell like it's a stale plum
I got my finger on the motherfuckin' pistol
Aimin' it at a pig, Charlotte's web is gonna miss you
My issue isn't televised and you ain't gotta tell the wise
How to stay on beat, because our life's an instrumental
This is physical and mental, I won't sugarcoat it
You'd die from diabetes if these other niggas wrote it
And everything on TV just a figment of imagination
I don't want a plastic nation, dread that like a Haitian
While you motherfuckers waiting, I be off the slave ship
Building pyramids, writing my own hieroglyphs

Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR
Nigga, nothing less than HiiiPoWeR
Five-star dishes, food for thought, bitches
I mean this shit is
Huey Newton going stupid, you can't resist his
HiiiPoWeR
Throw your hands up for HiiiPoWeR

Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
If I see it how he seen it, that would make my parents happy
Sorry, mama, I can't turn the other cheek
They wanna knock me off the edge like a fuckin' widow's peak, uh
And she always told me pray for the weak, uh
Them demons got me, I ain't prayed in some weeks, uh
Dear Lord, come save me, the Devil's working hard
He probably clockin' double shifts on all of his jobs
Frightenin', so fuckin' frightenin'
Enough to drive a man insane, I need a license to kill
I'm standing on a field full of land mines
Doin' the moonwalk, hopin' I blow up in time
'Cause 2012 might not be a fuckin' legend
Tryna be a fuckin' legend, the man of mankind
Who said a black man in the Illuminati?
Last time I checked, that was the biggest racist party
So get up off that slave ship
Build your own pyramids, write your own hieroglyphs

Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR
Nigga, nothing less than HiiiPoWeR
Five-star dishes, food for thought, bitches
I mean this shit is
Bobby Seale makin' meals, you can't resist his
HiiiPoWeR
Throw your hands up for HiiiPoWeR

[Alori Joh & (Kendrick Lamar):]
Every day, we fight the system just to make our way
We been down for too long, but that's alright
We was built to be strong, 'cause it's our life, na-na-na
Every day, we fight the system, we fight the system
We fight the system (Never like the system)
We been down for too long, but that's alright, na-na-na

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Who said a black man in the Illuminati?
Last time I checked, that was the biggest racist party
Last time I checked, we was racin' with Marcus Garvey
On the freeway to Africa 'til I wreck my Audi
And I want everybody to view my autopsy
So you can see exactly where the government had shot me
No conspiracy, my fate is inevitable
They play musical chairs once I'm on that pedestal
Frightenin', so fuckin' frightenin'
Enough to drive a man insane, a woman insane
The reason Lauryn Hill don't sing, or Kurt Cobain
Loaded that clip and then said bang
The drama it bring is crazy, product of the late '80s
Tryna stay above water, that's why we shun the Navy
Pull your guns and play me, let's set it off
'Cause a riot, throw a "Molotov"
Somebody told me them pirates had got lost
'Cause we been off them slave ships
Got our own pyramids, write our own hieroglyphs

Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR
Yeah, nothing less than HiiiPoWeR
Five-star dishes, food for thought, bitches
I mean this shit is
Fred Hampton on your campus, you can't resist his
HiiiPoWeR
Throw your hands up for HiiiPoWeR

Thug life
Thug life


Lord God, I come to You a sinner
And I humbly repent for my sins
I believe that Jesus is Lord
I believe that You raised him from the dead
I would ask that Jesus come to my life
And be my Lord and Savior
I receive Jesus to take control of my life
And that I may live for him from this day forth
Thank You, Lord Jesus, for saving me with Your precious blood
In Jesus' name, amen

I met her at this house party on El Segundo and Central
She had the credentials of strippers in Atlanta
Ass came with a hump, from the jump she was a camel
I want to ride like Arabians, push an '04 Mercedes-Benz
"Hello, my name is Kendrick," she said, "No, you're handsome"
Whispered in my ear, disappeared, then found her dancin'
Ciara had played in the background
The parade music we made had us all wearin' shades now, cool
"Where you stay?" She said, "Down the street from Dominguez High"
Okay, I know that's borderline Compton or Paramount
"Well, is it Compton?" "No," she replied
Then quickly start battin' her eyes
I strictly had wanted her thighs around me
Seventeen with nothin' but pussy stuck on my mental
My motive was rather sinful, "What you tryna get into?"
She didn't tell, just gave me her Nextel
Dropped the number, we chirped the whole summer, and, well
The summer had passed, and now I'm likin' her
Conversation we havin' probably enticin' her
Who can imagine? Maybe my actions'll end up wifin' her
Love or lust, regardless, we'll fuck 'cause the trife in us
It's deep-rooted, the music of bein' young and dumb
Is never muted, in fact, it's much louder where I'm from
We know a lot 'bout each other, her mother was a crack addict
She live with her granny and her younger two brothers
Her favorite cousin Demetrius is irrepetible
Family history of gangbangin' did make me skeptical
But not enough to stop me from gettin' a nut
"I wanna come over, what's up?"
That's what I told her soon as this episode
Of Martin go off, I'm tryna get off
I was in heat like a cactus
My tactics of bein' thirsty probably could hurt me
But fuck it, I got some heart
Grabbed my mama keys, hopped in the car, then, oh boy
So now I'm down Rosecrans in a Caravan
Passin' Alameda, my gas meter in need of a pump
I got enough to get me through the traffic jam
At least I hope, 'cause my pockets broke as a promise, man
I'm thinkin' 'bout that sex
Thinkin' 'bout her thighs or maybe kissin' on her neck or maybe what position's next
Sent a picture of her titties, blowin' up my texts
I looked at 'em and almost ran my front bumper into Corvette
Enthused by the touch of a woman, she's a masseuse
And I'm a professional pornstar when off the Goose
I had a fifth in the trunk like Curtis Jackson for ransom
I'm hopin' to get her loose like an Uncle Luke anthem
I'm two blocks away, two hundred and fifty feet
And six steps from where she stay, she wavin' me 'cross the street
I pulled up, a smile on my face, and then I see
Two niggas, two black hoodies, I froze as my phone rang

Please leave your message for three-two-three
Record your message after the tone
Kendrick, where you at?
Damn, I'm sittin' here waitin' on my van
You told me you was gon' be back in fifteen minutes
Man, I gotta go up to the county buildin', man, these kids ready to eat
I'm ready to eat, shit
I gotta get them food stamps, come on now
You on your way or what?
I hope you ain't out there messin' with them damn hoodrats out there, shit
'Specially that lil' crazy-ass girl Sherane
And plus you got school tomorrow
You keep fuckin' around in them streets, you ain't gon' pass to the next grade
Eleventh grade
(Is that Kendrick on the phone?)
Your daddy callin' about some damn dominoes (Let me holler at him)
He want to holler at you too, go ahead, Kenny, go'n, shit
Hello? Yak, where my motherfuckin' dominoes at?
(Kenny), What?
I'm on his voicemail, damn fool (Oh), shit
Yak, where my motherfuckin' dominoes at?
This the second time I asked you to bring my fuckin' dominoes
Just give me the damn phone, shit, don't hang up, damn, let me
Kendrick, when you get this message, man, call me back (Keep losin' my goddamn dominoes, we gon' have to go in the backyard)
I need to know when you gon' bring back my damn car (And squab, homie)
This man fussin' 'bout some damn dominoes
It ain't all that serious, fuck, damn dominoes
Shit, I'ma miss my damn appointment, fuck
Fuck some damn dominoes, nobody wanna hear that
Nobody wanna hear your ass
Matter fact, cut my motherfuckin' oldies back on
You killin' my motherfuckin' vibe


[Kendrick Lamar:]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me
Lord, forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling

Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe

Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life, I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you tell me it's painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hangin' with you?
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar
Another mistake livin' deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of his?
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge

I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin'
To you that's a quick check
With all disrespect, let me say this

I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me
Lord, forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling

Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe

I'm tryin' to keep it alive
And not compromise the feeling we love
You're tryin' to keep it deprived
And only co-sign what radio does
And I'm lookin' right past you
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you livin' behind the mirror
I know what you scared of
The feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name
I'll let the people know this is somethin' you can blame
On yourselves, you can remain stuck in a box
I'ma break out and then hide every lock
I'ma break out and then hide every lock

I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me, then put me on stages
To me, that's amazin'
To you that's a quick check
With all disrespect, let me say this

[Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise:]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me
Lord, forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling

Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe

Bitch, don't kill my vibe
You ain't heard the coast like this in a long time
Don't you see that long line?
And they waiting on Kendrick like the first and the fifteenth
Threes in the air, I can see you are in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings, now, what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on the pedestal

[Kendrick Lamar (Anna Wise):]
(Bitch, don't kill my vibe)
(Bitch, don't kill my vibe)
(Walk out the door and they scream it's alive)
My New Year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfuckin' much, I got my drink, I got my music

[Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise:]
I say bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe

[Death to Molly]

Ayy, K-Dot, get in the car, nigga!
Come on, we finna roll out!
Nigga, I got a pack of blacks and a beat CD
Get yo' freestyles ready!


Uh, Martin had a dream
Martin had a dream
Kendrick have a dream

All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours

Goddamn I feel amazing, damn I'm in the Matrix
My mind is living on cloud nine and this 9 is never on vacation
Start up that Maserati and vroom-vroom, I'm racing
Popping pills in the lobby and I pray they don't find her naked
And I pray you niggas is hating, shooters go after Judas
Jesus Christ if I live life on my knees, ain't no need to do this
Park it in front of Lueders, next to that Church's Chicken
All you pussies is losers, all my niggas is winners, screaming

All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours

Goddamn I got bitches, damn I got bitches 
Damn I got bitches, wifey, girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead showers

I've got twenty-five lighters on my dresser, yes sir
Put fire to that ass, body cast on a stretcher
And her body got that ass that a ruler couldn't measure
And it make me cum fast but I never get embarrassed
And I recognize you have what I've been wanting since that record
That Adina Howard had pop it fast to impress her
She rolling, I'm holding my scrotum and posing
This voice here is golden, so fuck y'all, I goes in and

All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours

Goddamn I got bitches, damn I got bitches
Damn I got bitches, wifey, girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or nigga it's go time

It's go time, I roll in dough with a good grind
And I run at ho with a baton
That's a relay race with a bouquet
They say, "K, you going marry mines"
Bitch, no way, bitch, no way, bitch, no way, bitch, OK
I'm never living life confined, as I feel you even if I'm blind
I can tell you who, what, when, where, how to sell your game right on time
Bitch, go play, bitch, go play, bitch, go play, bitch
I look like OJ, killing everything from pussy to a motherfuckin' Hit-Boy beat
She pussy popping and I got options like an audible, I be
C-O-M-P-T-O-N, I win, then ball at your defeat
C-O-M-P-T-O-N, my city, mobbing in the street, yelling

All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours

Goddamn I got bitches, damn I got bitches
Damn I got bitches, wifey, girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead showers
Let it run, Ali

Martin had a dream
Martin had a dream
Kendrick have a dream


[Part I]

Everybody, everybody, everybody
Everybody sit your bitch ass down and listen
To this true motherfuckin' story told by Kendrick Lamar on Rosecrans
Ya bitch

Smoking on the finest dope, aye aye aye aye
Drank until I can't no more, aye aye aye aye
Really I'm a sober soul but I'm with the homies right now
And we ain't asking for no favors
Rush a nigga quick then laugh about it later, aye aye aye aye
Really I'm a peacemaker but I'm with the homies right now
And mamma used to say (Say, say, say, say)
One day it's gon' burn you out (Woo)
One day it's gon' burn you out, out, out
One day it's gon' burn you out (You, you, you, you, you, you)
One day, it's gon' burn you
But I'm with the homies right now

[Part II]

Me and my niggas four deep in a white Toyota
A quarter tank of gas, one pistol, and orange soda
Janky stash box when the federales roll up
Basketball shorts with the Gonzales Park odor
We on the mission for bad bitches and trouble
I hope the universe love you today
'Cause the energy we bringing sure to carry away
A flock of positive activists that fill their body with hate
If it's necessary
Bumping Jeezy first album looking distracted
Speaking language only we know, you think it's an accent
The windows roll down all I see is a hand pass it
Hot-boxing like George Foreman grilling the masses
Of the working world, we pulled up on a bunch of working girls
And aksed them what they working with – look at me
I got the blunt in my mouth
Usually I'm drug-free, but, shit, I'm with the homies

(Yeah nigga, we off a pill and Rémy Red
Come through and bust ya head, nigga)
Me and the homies
(Sag all the way to the liquor store
Where my niggas pour up 4 and get twisted some more)
Me and the homies
(I ride for my motherfuckin' niggas
Hop out, do my stuff, then hop back in)
Me and the homies
(Matter fact, I hop out that motherfucker and be like
"Doo! Doo! Doo! Doo!...Doo! Doo! Doo! Doo! Doo!")

It's 2:30 and the sun is beaming
Air conditioner broke and I hear my stomach screaming
Hungry for anything unhealthy and if nutrition can help me
I'll tell you to suck my dick then I'll continue eating
We speeding on the 405 passing Westchester
You know the light-skinned girls in all the little dresses, good Lord
They knew we weren't from 'round there
'Cause every time we down there we pulling out the Boost Mobile SIM cards
Bougie bitches with no extensions
Hood niggas with bad intentions, the perfect combination
Before we sparked a conversation
We seen three niggas in colors we didn't like then started interrogating
I never was a gang-banger, I mean I never was stranger to the fonk neither
I really doubt it
Rush a nigga quick and then we laugh about it
That's ironic 'cause I've never been violent, until I'm with the homies

(Just ridin', just ridin')
Me and the homies
(Bullshittin', actin' a fool)
Me and the homies
(Trippin', really trippin')
Me and the homies
(Just ridin', just ridin', just ridin'...)

Bragging 'bout the episode we just had
A shot of Hennessy didn't make me feel that bad
I'm usually a true firm believer of bad karma
Consequences from evil will make your past haunt you
We tryna conquer the city with disobedience
Quick to turn it up, even if we ain't got the CD in
But Jeezy still playing and our attitude is still "nigga, what is you saying"
Pull in front of the house that we been camping out for like two months
The sun is going down as we take whatever we want
(Ay, ay, nigga jackpot nigga, pop the safe
Ay nigga, I think somebody in this room
Wait, what?
Nigga, there's somebody in this room!)
I hit the back window in search of any Nintendo
DVDs, plasma-screen TVs in the trunk
We made a right, then made a left, then made a right
Then made a left, we was just circling life
My mama called – "Hello? What you doin'?" "Kicking it"
I should've told her I'm probably 'bout to catch my first offense with the homies

But they made a right, they made a left then made a right
Then another right
One lucky night with the homies

K. Dot, you faded, hood?
Yeah we finally got that nigga faded. I think he hit the wrong blunt though
Ooh, which one?
Well which one he talking 'bout? I was finna hit the one with the shenanigans in it
I pray he ain't hit that
Nah, that nigga straight. He ain't hit that one
Got the shenanigans? Give that nigga the shenanigans
Nigga I think we should push back to the city, for real doe Nigga, for what?
What that nigga, what's that Jeezy song say nigga?
"Last time I checked I was the man on these streets!"
Yeah, yeah, that shit right there. I'm tryna be the nigga in the street
There he go. Man you don't even know how the shit go
Look, here's the plan luv. We gon' use the kickback as an alibi
Wait 'til the sun go down, roll out, complete the mission, drop K. Dot off at his mama van, at the park
'Cause I know he tryna fuck on Sherane tonight
That's what he's not gon' do. Then we all gon' meet back at the block at about 10:30
That's straight but we should meet up around 12, I'm tryna fuck on something too
Nigga sit yo dumb ass back down, nigga you ain't doing shit tonight
Matter fact, nigga get in the motherfuckin' car. We finna get active


[Kendrick Lamar:]
Uh, me and my niggas tryna get it, ya bish (Ya bish)
Hit the house lick: tell me, is you wit' it, ya bish? (Ya bish)
Home invasion was persuasive (Was persuasive)
From nine to five I know it's vacant, ya bish (Ya bish)
Dreams of livin' life like rappers do (Like rappers do)
Back when condom wrappers wasn't cool (They wasn't cool)
I fucked Sherane and went to tell my bros (Tell my bros)
Then Usher Raymond "Let It Burn" came on ("Let Burn" came on)
Hot sauce all in our Top Ramen, ya bish (Ya bish)
Park the car, then we start rhymin', ya bish (Ya bish)
The only thing we had to free our mind (Free our mind)
Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs (See dollar signs)
You lookin' like a easy come-up, ya bish (Ya bish)
A silver spoon I know you come from, ya bish (Ya bish)
And that's a lifestyle that we never knew (We never knew)
Go at a reverend for the revenue

[Jay Rock:]
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison, tell me what you doin'
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
(The one in front of the gun, forever)
And I been hustlin' all day
This-a-way, that-a-way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And that's just how I feel

Nah, nah
A dollar might just fuck your main bitch
That's just how I feel, nah
A dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with
That's just how I feel, nah, nah
A dollar might just make that lane switch
That's just how I feel, nah
A dollar might turn to a million and we all rich
That's just how I feel

Dreams of livin' life like rappers do (Like rappers do)
Bump that new E-40 after school (Way after school)
You know, "Big Ballin' With My Homies" (My homies)
Earl Stevens had us thinkin' rational (Thinkin' rational, that's rational)
Back to reality, we poor, ya bish (Ya bish)
Another casualty at war, ya bish (Ya bish)
Two bullets in my uncle Tony head (My Tony head)
He said one day I'll be on tour, ya bish (Ya bish)
That Louis Burgers never be the same (Won't be the same)
A Louis belt that never ease that pain (Won't ease that pain)
But I'ma purchase when that day is jerkin' (That day is jerkin')
Pull off at Church's, with Pirellis skirtin' (Pirellis skirtin')
Gang signs out the window, ya bish (Ya bish)
Hopin' all of 'em offend you, ya bish (Ya bish)
They say your hood is a pot of gold (A pot of gold)
And we gon' crash it when nobody's home

[Jay Rock:]
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison, tell me what you doin'
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
(The one in front of the gun, forever)
And I been hustlin' all day
This-a-way, that-a-way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And that's just how I feel

[Anna Wise:]
Be the last one out to get this dough? No way!
Love one of you bucket-headed hoes? No way!
Hit the streets, then we break the code? No way!
Hit the brakes when they on patrol? No way!
Be the last one out to get this dough? No way!
Love one of you bucket-headed hoes? No way!
Hit the streets, then we break the code? No way!
Hit the brakes when they on patrol? No way!

[Jay Rock:]
Imagine Rock up in them projects
Where them niggas pick your pockets
Santa Claus don't miss them stockings
Liquors spillin', pistols poppin'
Bakin' soda YOLA whippin'
Ain't no turkey on Thanksgivin'
My homeboy just dome'd a nigga
I just hope the Lord forgive him
Pots with cocaine residue
Every day I'm hustlin'
What else is a thug to do
When you eatin' cheese from the government?
Gotta provide for my daughter n'em
Get the fuck up out my way, bitch
Got that drum and I got them bands
Just like a parade, bitch
Drop that work up in the bushes
Hope them boys don't see my stash
If they do, tell the truth
This the last time you might see my ass
From the gardens where the grass ain't cut
Them serpents lurkin', Blood
Bitches sellin' pussy, niggas sellin' drugs
But it's all good
Broken promises, steal your watch
And tell you what time it is
Take your J's and tell you to kick it where a FootLocker is
In the streets with a heater under my Dungarees
Dreams of me gettin' shaded under a money tree

[Kendrick Lamar:]
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison, tell me what you doin'
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
(The one in front of the gun, forever)
And I been hustlin' all day
This-a-way, that-a-way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And that's just how I feel

[Kendrick's Mom:]
Kendrick, just bring my car back, man. I called in for another appointment. I figured you weren't gonna be back here on time anyways. Look, shit, shit, I just wanna get out the house, man. This man is on one, he feelin' good as a motherfucker. Shit, I'm tryna get my thing goin', too. Just bring my car back. Shit, he faded. He feelin' good. Look, listen to him!

[Kendrick's Dad:]
Girl, girl, I want your body, I want your body, 'cause of that big ol' fat ass. Girl, girl, I want your body, I want your body, 'cause of that big ol' fat ass

[Kendrick's Mom:]
See, he high as hell. Shit, and he ain't even trippin' off them damn dominoes anymore. Just bring the car back!

[Kendrick's Dad:]
Did somebody say dominoes?


[Kendrick Lamar:]
Every second, every minute, man, I swear that she can get it
Say if you a bad bitch put your hands up high, hands up high, hands up high
Tell 'em dim the lights down right now, put me in the mood
I'm talking 'bout dark room, perfume, go, go

I recognize your fragrance, hold up, you ain't never gotta say shit, uh
And I know your taste is, a little bit hmm, high maintenance, uh
Everybody else basic, you live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
You're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen
Better yet, where your friends and 'em? I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off, fuck that
Pour up plenty of champagne, cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends and y'all curled in that little bitty Range I heard that
She wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
Nigga don't approach her with that Atari, nigga, that ain't good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation rule a nation, I can tell
But I could never right my wrongs 'less I write it down for real, P.S

You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright

[Drake:]
I really hope you play this, 'cause ol' girl, you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs and all these one-off vacations
You've been taking clearly a lot for me to take in, it don't make sense
Young East African girl, you too busy fucking with your other man
I was tryna put you on game, put you on a plane
Take you and your mamma to the motherland, I could do it
Maybe one day when you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's alright here in the city and you don't run from where we come from
That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice
You were so new to this life but goddamn, you got adjusted
I mean I write poems in these songs dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin and your big ass in that sundress, ooh
Good God, what you doing that walk for?
When I see that thing move, I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
And they say communication save relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs unless I write 'em down for real, P.S

[Kendrick Lamar:]
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright

Every time I write these words, they become a taboo
Making sure my punctuation curve, every letter here's true
Living my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
I'm talking poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
It's you looking in the mirror, love is not just a verb
It's you looking for it, maybe, call me crazy, we can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common and what we have common is pain
I mean you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
And I can see power steering, sex drive when you swerve
I want that interference, it's coherent, I can hear it, uh-huh
That's your heartbeat, it either caught me or it called me, uh-huh
Read slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours truly and right before you go blind, P.S

You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright

[Skit:]
"I'm gon' ask you one more time homie, where is you from? Or it is a problem"
"Ay you over here for Sherane homie?"
"Yo I don't care who this nigga over here for, if he don't tell me where he from, it's a wrap! I'm sorry"
"Hol' up hol' up hol' up, we gon' do it like this, OK? I'mma tell you where I'm from, OK? You gon' tell me where you from, OK? Or where your grandma stay, where your mama stay, or where your daddy stay, OK?"
"Enough with all this talking"
"Matter of fact, get out the van homie. Get out the car before I snatch you out that motherfucker homie"


[Pharrell Williams:]
Mass hallucination, baby
Ill education, baby
Want to reconnect with your elations?
This is your station, baby

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Look inside these walls and you see I'm havin' withdrawals
Of a prisoner on his way
Trapped inside your desire to fire bullets that stray
Track attire just tell you I'm tired and ran away
I should ask a choir: "What do you require
To sing a song that acquire me to have faith?"
As the record spin I should pray
For the record, I recognize that I'm easily prey
I got ate alive yesterday
I got animosity buildin', it's prob'ly big as a buildin'
Me jumpin' off of the roof is me just playin' it safe
But what am I 'posed to do when the topic is red or blue
And you understand that I ain't
But know I'm accustomed to just a couple that look for trouble
And live in the street with rank
No better picture to paint than me walkin' from Bible study
And called his homies because he had said he noticed my face
From a function that tooken place, they was wonderin' if I bang
Step on my neck and get blood on your Nike checks
I don't mind 'cause one day you'll respect
The good kid, m.A.A.d city

[Pharrell Williams:]
Mass hallucination, baby
Ill education, baby
Want to reconnect with your elations?
This is your station, baby

[Kendrick Lamar:]
All I see is strobe lights, blindin' me in my hindsight
Findin' me by myself, promise me you can help
In all honesty I got time to be copacetic until
You had finally made decision to hold me against my will
It was like a head-on collision that folded me standing still
I can never pick out the difference and grade a cop on the bill
Every time you clock in the morning, I feel you just want to kill
All my innocence while ignorin' my purpose to persevere
As a better person; I know you heard this and probably in fear
But what am I 'posed to do when the blinkin' of red and blue
Flash from the top of your roof and your dog has to say woof
And you ask: "Lift up your shirt," because you wonder if a tattoo
Of affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me through
Gang files, but that don't matter because the matter is racial profile
I heard 'em chatter: "He's prob'ly young, but I know that he's down
Step on his neck as hard as your bullet-proof vest
He don't mind, he know we'll never respect
The good kid, m.A.A.d. city."

[Pharrell Williams:]
Mass hallucination, baby
Ill education, baby
Want to reconnect with your elations?
This is your station, baby

[Kendrick Lamar:]
All I see in this room: 20's, Xannies and these 'shrooms
Grown-up candy for pain, can we live in a sane
Society? It's entirely stressful upon my brain
You hired me as a victim, I quietly hope for change
When violence is the rhythm, inspired me to obtain
The silence in this room with 20's, Xannies and 'shrooms
Some grown-up candy, I lost it, I feel it's nothin' to lose
The streets sure to release the worst side of my best
Don't mind, 'cause now you ever in debt to good kid, m.A.A.d. city

[Pharrell Williams:]
Mass hallucination, baby
Ill education, baby
Want to reconnect with your elations?
This is your station, baby


[Part I]

[Kendrick Lamar (ScHoolBoy Q):]
If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street, I hear
(Yawk! Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!)

[Kendrick Lamar:]
"Man down, where you from, nigga?"
"Fuck who you know! Where you from, my nigga?"
"Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?"
"This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga"

Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slingin' crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin' on your brain
It was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, wavin' yo' hand out the window – check yourself!
Uh, Warriors and Conans, Hope euphoria can slow dance
With society, the driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where [*beep*] hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin' at him different
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up, you fuckin' punk?
Pickin' up the fuckin' pump, pickin' off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch
A wall of bullets comin' from AK's, AR's, "Ayy, y'all, duck!"
That's what mamma said when we was eatin' that free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo' truce!
Now crawl your head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just piecing BGs up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IVs on top of IVs
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your color's correct
Make sure you're corporate or they'll be callin' your mother collect
They say the governor collect all of our taxes, except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess
M.A.A.d city

"Man down, where you from, nigga?"
"Fuck who you know! Where you from, my nigga?"
"Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?"
"This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga"

[Kendrick Lamar (ScHoolBoy Q):]
If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street, I hear—
(Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!)

[Part II]

[MC Eiht:]
Wake yo' punk-ass up!
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
G-yeah, real simple and plain
Let me teach you some lessons about the street
(Smoke somethin', nigga!)
Hood ('Sup, cuz?)
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
G-yeah, how we do

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Fresh outta school 'cause I was a high school grad'
Sleepin' in the living room of my mamma's pad
Reality struck, I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
My pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leavin'
In fact, I got fired, 'cause I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foamin' at the mouth
I was straight tweakin', the next weekend we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin'
You know the reasons but still will never know my life
Kendrick a.k.a. "Compton's Human Sacrifice"

[MC Eiht:]
G-yeah, cocaine, weed
Niggas been mixin' shit since the '80s, loc
Sherm sticks, butt-nakeds
Dip, make a nigga flip
Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
One time's crooked and shit
Block a nigga in
Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis, it's Compton

I'm still in the hood, loc, yeah, that's cool
Shit, the hood took me under, so I follow the rules
But yeah, that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doin' the same thang
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-bys in the hood lately, shit
Couple of IVs with the fuckin' spray can
Shots in the crowd, then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave
Mount up, regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip, yeah
Trip, we in the hood still
So, loc, grab a strap 'cause yeah, it's so real, yeah
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and ten grand's where a motherfucker stand

[Kendrick Lamar:]
If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me?
Perceive me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat?
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of bein' a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage
Kill 'em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn, they vandalizin' the option
Of livin' a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinkin' and drive
Hit the powder, then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
Listen, coward, the concept is aim and then bang it and slide
Out that bitch with deposit, a price on his head, the tithes
Probably go to the projects, I
Live inside the belly of the rough, Compton, USA
Made Me an Angel on Angel Dust, what?

[Scratches:]
M.A.A.d city
Compton

Nigga, pass Dot the bottle, damn!
You ain't the one that got fucked up
What you holdin' it for?
Niggas always actin' unsensitive and shit
Nigga, that ain't no word
Nigga, shut up!
Hey, Dot, you good, my nigga?
Don't even trip
Just lay back and drink that


Pour up (drank), head shot (drank)
Sit down (drank), stand up (drank)
Pass out (drank), wake up (drank)
Faded (drank), faded (drank)

Now I done grew up 'round some people living their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask
Back stroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels
Some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular
That was my problem
I was in a dark room
Loud tunes, looking to make a vow soon
That I'mma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup
I see the crowd mood
Changing by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me

Nigga why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor I'mma dive in it

Pour up (drank), head shot (drank)
Sit down (drank), stand up (drank)
Pass out (drank), wake up (drank)
Faded (drank), faded (drank)

Okay, now open your mind up and listen me, Kendrick
I am your conscience, if you do not hear me
Then you will be history, Kendrick
I know that you're nauseous right now
And I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down
I'mma drown in some poison abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe
I see the love in her eyes, I see the feelin'
The freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrived
This how you capitalize
This is parental advice
Then apparently, I'm over-influenced by what you are doin'
I thought I was doin' the most 'til someone said to me

Nigga why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor I'mma dive in it

Pour up (drank), head shot (drank)
Sit down (drank), stand up (drank)
Pass out (drank), wake up (drank)
Faded (drank), faded (drank)

I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one hundred shots, bang
Hop out. Do you bang?
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang
I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one hundred shots, bang
Hop out. Do you bang?
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang

Nigga why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor I'mma dive in it

Pour up (drank), head shot (drank)
Sit down (drank), stand up (drank)
Pass out (drank), wake up (drank)
Faded (drank), faded (drank)

(Pool full of Kendrick's lies in it)
Aw man... where is she taking me?
Where is she taking me?
(Pool full of liquor, I'ma die in it)

All I, all I, all I, all I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane
Tell me, do that sound familiar?
If it do, then you're like me
Making excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of the bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release
Everything that corrode inside of me
I see you joking, why you laugh?
Don't you feel bad? I probably sleep
And never ever wake up, never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust, but just when I thought I had enough

They stomped the homie out over a bitch?
K-Dot, you good, blood?
Now we can drop, ye we can drop you back off
That nigga's straight, man, that nigga ain't tripping
We gon' do the same ol' shit
I'ma pop a few shots, they gon' run, they gon' run opposite ways
Fall right in ***'s lap
And he gon' tear they ass up, simple as that
And I hope that bitch that set him up out there
We gon' pop that bitch too
Wait hold up, ayy, I see somebody
Aha! Got them niggas, K-Dot, you good?
L****, you good?
Yeah, blood, I'm good – Dave, you good?
Dave? Dave, say something – Dave?
These bitch-ass niggas killed my brother!


[Sing About Me]

When the lights shut off
And it's my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

I said when the lights shut off
And it's my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you
In case I'm not here tomorrow
I'm hoping that I can borrow a peace of mind
I'm behind on what's really important
My mind is really distorted
I find nothing but trouble in my life
I'm fortunate you believe in a dream
This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
And last night was just another distraction
Or a reaction of what we consider madness
I know exactly what happened
You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
Like everything was alright
And a fight he tried to put up, but the type
Of bullet that stuck had went against his will
That's blood spilled on your hands
My plan's rather vindictive
Everybody's a victim in my eyes
When I ride it's a murderous rhythm
And outside became pitch black
A demon glued to my back whispering, "Get 'em"
I got 'em, and I ain't give a fuck
That same mentality I told my brother not to duck
In actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors
I wonder if I'll ever discover
A passion like you and recover
The life that I knew as a young'n
In pajamas and Dun-ta-duns
When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs
Dumb niggas like me never prosper
Prognosis of a problem child
I'm proud and well devoted
This Piru shit been in me forever
So forever I'm 'a push it, wherever whenever
And I love you 'cause you love my brother like you did
Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big
And if I die before your album drop I hope -

Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

I said when the lights shut off
And it's my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

You wrote a song about my sister on your tape
And called it Section.80, the message resembled "Brenda's Got a Baby"
What's crazy was, I was hearing about it
But doubted your ignorance, how could you ever
Just put her on blast and shit?
Judging her past and shit?
Well, it's completely my future
Her nigga behind me right now asking for ass and shit
And I'm 'a need that forty dollars even if I gotta
Fuck, suck and swallow in the parking lot
Gonzales Park, I'm followed by a married man, a father of three
My titties bounce on the cadence of his tingling keys
Matter of fact he my favorite 'cause he tip me with Es
He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
These foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'em
See, my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em back
To where they used to be then I'll probably be in the denim
Of a family gene that show women how to be woman, or better yet a leader
You need her to learn something, then you probably need to beat her
That's how I was taught
Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed
And I'm exhausted
But fuck that "Sorry for your loss shit"
My sister died in vain, but what point are you tryna gain
If you can't fit the pumps I walk in?
I'll wait
Your rebuttal a little too late
And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song
'Cause I don't need the attention bring enough of that on my own
And matter fact did I mention that I physically feel great?
A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight
I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away
I know my fate, and I'm on the grind for this cake
I'm 'a get it or die trying, I'm eyeing every male gender with intentions of buying
You lying to these motherfuckers, talking about you can help 'em with my story
You can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga
Don't ignore me nigga, fuck your glory nigga, this bullshit

When the lights shut off
And it's my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

I said when the lights shut off
And it's my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

Sometimes I look in a mirror and aks myself
Am I really scared of passing away?
If it's today I hope I hear a
Cry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon
With the Holy Ghost 'til it drown in the blood of Jesus
I wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline
Reeking the scent of a reaper, ensuring that my allegiance
With the other side may come soon
And if I'm doomed, may the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons
I suffer a lot
And every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch
I tie my stomach in knots
And I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death
My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
That can come about
'Cause the tongue is mighty powerful
And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
Maybe 'cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
Really stuck in the scheme of wondering when I'm 'a rest
And you're right, your brother was a brother to me
And your sister's situation was the one that pulled me
In a direction to speak on something that's realer than the TV screen
By any means, wasn't trying to offend or come between
Her personal life, I was like "It need to be told
Cursing the life of twenty generations after her soul"
Exactly what'd happen if I ain't continue rapping
Or steady being distracted by money drugs and four
Fives, I count lives all on these songs
Look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong
Fighting for your rights, even when you're wrong
And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone
Am I worth it?
Did I put enough work in?

Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

I said when the lights shut off
And it's my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooh

Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooh

Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooh

Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooh

[Skit:]
"Ay, ay, ay, where you 'bout to go?"
"Nigga, the homie's brother—nigga, right here, he gone, my nigga, he gone!"
"Hey, come to the store for a nigga, one time."
"We on the block right now, my nigga, like, we—nigga, we right here, my nigga."
"Bring a nigga back a black!"
"Nigga—bruh—nigga, they just killed the homie's brother, my nigga. We right here on the block, my nigga... Al—alright, nigga—nigga, just come—alright, alright, just call me back, man, just call me back."
"Bring a nigga back a black!"
"Ah, fuck... So, so, what we gon' do, my niggas? What we gon' do?"
"Bro, we can go back right now, my nigga. Like... nigga, I don't give a fuck, my nigga. We can go back right now."
"Fuck! I'm tired of this shit! I'm tired of fucking running, I'm tired of this shit! My brother, homie!"

[I'm Dying of Thirst]

Tired of running
Tired of hunting
My own kind
But retiring nothing
Tires are steady screeching, the driver is rubbing
Hands on the wheel, who said we wasn't?
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst

Dope on the corner
Look at the coroner
Daughter is dead
Mother is mourning her
Strayed bullets, AK bullets
Resuscitation was waiting patiently
But they couldn't, bring her back
Who got the footage? Channel 9
Cameras is looking, it's hard to channel your energy
When you know he crooked
Banana clip split his banana pudding
I'm like Tre, that's Cuba Gooding
I know I'm good at
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst

How many sins?
I'm running out
How many sins?
I lost count
Dreams of balling like Spalding
But only shotty bounce
The reaper calling
I'm cottonmouth
Money is power
Money is power
Yours is ours
Yours is ours
Lay with a snitch, die with a coward
Hope we get rich, hope we can tower
Over the city with vanity with the music louder
The same song
A black flower
I'll show you how to
Dye your thirst
Dye your thirst
Dye your thirst

What are we doing?
Who are we fooling?
Hell is hot, fire is proven
To burn for eternity, return of the student
That never learned how to live righteous but how to shoot it
Tired of running, choirs is humming
Tell us to visit, we lie about coming
Now back to business, loading the guns in
Back of the Buick, your hood is feuding
The beef is bubbling
It's no discussion, hereditary
All of my cousins
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst

Too many sins
I'm running out
Somebody send
Me a well for the drought
See, all I know, is taking notes
On taking this life for granted
Granted, if he provoke
My best days, I stress days (Lord forgive me for all my sins for I not know...)
My best days, I stress days
Say "Fuck the world, " my sex slave
Money, pussy and greed what's my next crave?
Whatever it is, know it's my next grave
Tired of running, tired of running
I'm tired of tumbling, tired of running
I'm tired of tumbling
Backwards my mama say
"See a pastor, give me a promise
What if today was the rapture, and you completely tarnished
The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest
You dying of thirst
You dying of thirst
So hop in that water, and pray that it works"

[Skit:]
Fuck! I'm tired of this shit!
I'm tired of fucking running, I'm tired of this shit!
That's my brother, homie!
Young man, come talk to me! Is that what I think that is?
I know that's not what I think that is
Why are you so angry?
See, you young men are dying of thirst
Do you know what that means?
That means you need water, holy water
You need to be baptized with the spirit of the Lord
Do you want to receive God as your personal savior?
OK, repeat after me:
"Lord God, I come to You a sinner."
(Lord God, I come to You a sinner)
"And I humbly repent for my sins."
(And I humbly repent for my sins)
"I believe that Jesus is Lord."
(I believe that Jesus is Lord)
"I believe You raised Him from the dead."
(I believe You raised Him from the dead)
"I would aks that Jesus come into my life."
(I would aks that Jesus come in my life)
"And be my Lord and Savior."
(And be my Lord and Savior)
"I receive Jesus to take control of my life."
(I receive Jesus to take control of my life)
"And that I may live for Him from this day forward."
(And that I may live for Him from this day forward)
"Thank you, Lord Jesus, for saving me with Your precious blood."
(Thank you, Lord Jesus, for saving me with Your precious blood)
"In Jesus' name, amen."
(In Jesus' name, amen)
Alright now, remember this day
The start of a new life – your real life


[Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise:]
I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real

[Kendrick Lamar:]
I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie, even if they tell
Sweet lullabies that come with a smell
Of a dozen roses flipping down the green hill
You're living in a world that come with plan B
'Cause plan A never relay a guarantee
And plan C never could say just what it was
And your plans only can pan around love
You love him, you love them, you love her
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love red bottom and gold that say "Queen"
You love hand-bag on the waist of your jean
You love French tip and trip that pay for
You love bank slip that tell you we paid more
You love a good hand whenever the card dealt
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?

[Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise:]
I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, ('Cause before you know it, everything's gone)

[Kendrick Lamar:]
I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie, even if they fell
Out the sky and your optics turn stale
Where they mold that's green, I can see you fit the bill
Of living in a world that come with plan B
'Cause plan A only can make another mistake
And you can't see success coming from plan C
When it all breaks, you'll still say you're lovely
And love them and love when you love her
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love fast cars and dead presidents old
You love fast women, you love keepin' control
Of everything that you love, you love beef
You love streets, you love running, ducking police
You love your hood, might even love it to death
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?

[Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise:]
I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real ('Cause before you know it, everything's gone)

[Kendrick Lamar:]
The reason why I know you very well
'Cause we have the same eyes, can't you tell?
The days I tried to cover up and conceal
My pride, it only made it harder for me to deal
When living in a world that come with plan B
A scapegoat 'cause plan A don't come free
And plan C just an excuse like "because"
Or the word "but", but what if I got love?
I love them, I love when I love her
I love so much, I love when love hurts
I love first verse 'cause you're the girl I attract
I love second verse 'cause you're the homie that pack
Burner like a stove top, that love cooking from scratch
I love what the both of you have to offer
In fact, I love it so much, I don't love anything else
But what love got to do with it when I don't love myself
To the point I should hate everything I do love?
Should I hate living my life inside the club?
Should I hate her for watching me for that reason?
Should I hate him for telling me that I'm seizin'?
Should I hate them for telling me "ball out"?
Should I hate street credibility I'm talkin' about
Hating all money, power, respect in my will
Or hating the fact none of that shit make me real?

[Kenny Duckworth:]
Kenny, I ain't trippin' off them dominoes anymore. Just calling, sorry to hear what happened to your homeboy, but don't learn the hard way like I did, homie. Any nigga can kill a man, that don't make you a real nigga. Real is responsibility. Real is taking care of your motherfucking family. Real is God, nigga

[Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise:]
I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real ('cause before you know it, everything's gone)

[Kenny Duckworth (Paula Duckworth):]
Alright, that's all I wanted to tell you. Just make sure you call us back when you get this message. Here go your mom
(Boy, you better have my car on full all this time you done had my damn car, but look I ain't trippin'. Look, the neighbors say they seen you and your little friends over there by Food for Less and they was preaching to you over there telling you about the good book because right about now that's what y'all need. Oh, and Top Dawg called the house too. I guess they want you and Dave to come to the studio. But look, you take that music business serious, and put out something me and your dad can step to. Shit, you know we from Chicago, you know that's what we do)

[Anna Wise:]
Sing my song, it's all for you
Sing my song, it's all for you
Sing my song, it's all for you
Sing my song, it's all for you
Sing my song, it's all for you
Sing my song, it's all for you

Sing my song, it's all for you
Sing my song, it's all for you
Sing my song, it's all for you
Sing my song, it's all for you

[Paula Duckworth:]
"If I don't hear from you by tomorrow, I hope you come back and learn from your mistakes. Come back a man, tell your story to these black and brown kids in Compton. Let 'em know you was just like them, but you still rose from that dark place of violence, becoming a positive person. But when you do make it, give back with your words of encouragement, and that's the best way to give back. To your city... And I love you Kendrick, if I don't hear you knocking on the door you know where I usually leave the key. Alright? Talk to you later, bye."


[Kendrick Lamar:]
Now everybody serenade the new faith of Kendrick Lamar
This is King Kendrick Lamar
King Kendrick and I meant it, my point intended is raw
Fix your lenses forensics would've told you Kendrick had killed it
Pretend it's a massacre and the masses upon us
And I mastered being the master at dodging your honor
And the chapter that read at 25 I would live dormant like five in the morning
They raid your spot while Kendrick's performing
And if they take everything, know I got

[Sample:]
Compton, Compton
Ain't no city quite like mine

[Dr. Dre (Kendrick Lamar):]
(Ay, Dre what's happening wit' it, my nigga?)
Still I'm at it, peel the plastic off it, you can feel the magic
Still I'm laughing at the critics talking, I can see 'em gagging
When I'm back in the back of my city, back in the 'bach
With a batch of them banging Dre Beats with me, look where I'm at
It's the murder cap' and I'm captain at birthing this gangsta rap
It's a wrap when I'm done and I come a long way from a hundred dollars a month
To a hundred mil' in a day, bitch I'm from

[Sample:]
Compton, Compton
Ain't no city quite like mine

[Kendrick Lamar:]
So come and visit the tire screeching, ambulance, policeman
Won't you spend a weekend on Rosecrans, nigga?
Khaki creasing, crime increasing on Rosecrans, nigga
Kendrick Conan, nigga
Where you sword at, hand on the cross and swore that
I do it big as Rasputia for them shooters
Kama Sutra scream fuck your position and make you hold that
I'm trying to stay grounded like four flats
But I know flats and Piru Crip tats

Will swarm on me like a beehive
Hop in the G ride
From the West to the Eastside
Know that's just how Compton roll

[Dr. Dre (Kendrick Lamar) {Both}:]
And that's a given
I pass the blunt then pass the torch of course that's my decision
I crash the Porsche then you report that you see me in Benzes
I must report that we import {the narcotics you bought it}
{Then talked about it when crack} (hit the speakers, the music business)
(I blow up every time we throw up a record)
(Depending on what you expecting, I'm sure it's bigger than your religion)
(Perfected by niggas that manifested music to live in)

[Sample:]
Compton, Compton
Ain't no city quite like mine

[Dr. Dre:]
So tell that gangster throw his set high
Roll it up in a blunt, I'ma take you on the next high
I did exactly what I wanted that's what made them checks fly
In my direction, you never questioned when I said I
Would be a mogul before I visit 2Pac and Left-Eye
Eazy and Aaliyah when I see you we gon' test drive
A Lambo in heaven but for now I'm on the red-eye
Flying back to my city 'cause I'll forever standby

[Sample:]
Compton, Compton
Ain't no city quite like mine

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Now we can all celebrate
We can all harvest the rap artists of N.W.A
America target our rap market, as controversy and hate
Harsh realities we in made our music translate
To the coke dealers, the hood rich
And the broke niggas that play
With them gorillas that know killers
That know where you stay
Roll that kush, crack that case, ten bottles of Rosé
This was brought to you by Dre
Now every motherfucker in here say:
"Look who's responsible
For taking Compton international
I make 'em holla"

Ayo Just Blaze, good looking homie
Just Blaze
Ain't no city quite like mine, yeah
In the city of Compton
Ain't no city quite like mine

Mom, I finna use the van real quick!
Be back, 15 minutes!


(Smokin' weed with you
'Cause you've taught me to
Smokin' weed with you
'Cause you've taught me to)

[Dr. Dre & Kendrick Lamar:]
Every morning when I wake up, uh
Money on my mind, good time to get caked up, uh
Sunshine coming through my blinds, I'm living, but
Really though, it's never enough, ten million, that's a must
Living in California, everybody wanna visit for
Women, weed and weather
They come for women, weed and weather
For the women, weed and weather
From all around the world for the women, weed and weather
These niggas'll kill for that, put it in your grill for that
Still everybody gotta build for that, me? I make mills off that
How the fuck y'all can't see I ride, when I drive
Down the block and you look outside
H-A-T-E in your eyes, I enter big money for the enterprise
It's a beautiful day, I guess, for a bitch to roll with Andre, I guess
Roll it up, baby, come and lift that dress
Then roll it up for me when I'm stressed

[Kendrick Lamar:]
You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
Texas, I be screwed up, Chi-Town, I be really pimpin'
But nothing like my hometown, I'm forever livin'

[Kendrick Lamar & Dr. Dre:]
Women, weed and weather
They come for women, weed and weather
For the women, weed and weather
From all around the world for the women, weed and weather
Got that women, weed and weather
Don't it sound clever? Come and play
Wh-what more can I say? W-welcome to LA

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Uh, my nigga said he wanna fly out to get him some
Three Ws only for a three-day run, bitch
Take them motherfuckin' panties off, you ain't no nun, shit
I be living in the sky every time I ride by them hoes
"Ribbon In The Sky" on the radio 'cause Stevie know I control
Let it breathe, I control, California living 'til I am old
You want to be on to peak on the charts
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
She in the coupe, she in the Neon
'Cause she on the BS before we can start
Fuck with a nigga, ride with a nigga
Let 'em know I'm priority, order me
Hennessy and, for my niggas, OG Killa
Call it Jason Voorhees, boy, he's on his job
Boy, he sure be having the marks on they mark
Pretty bitches and tire marks, let 'em inhale them pipe exhausts
Let 'em reveal how much it cost for this life, controlling my price?
No way, hell no, uh-uh
If I'm wrong, I don't wanna be right
We want to be on to peak on the charts
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
Women, weed, weather, it's not my fault
That it's 82 degrees and my top peeled off

You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
Texas, I be screwed up, Chi-Town, I be really pimpin'
But nothing like my hometown, I'm forever livin'

[Kendrick Lamar & Dr. Dre:]
Women, weed and weather

From all around the world for the women, weed and weather
Got that women, weed and weather
Don't it sound clever? Come and play
Wh-what more can I say? W-welcome to LA

[Dr. Dre:]
Known for that homegrown where I come from
Smoke one, palm trees, double Ds got 'em topless in the sun
I shall proceed, that's me, motherfuck your opinion
Huh, how many ways am I killing 'em? Shit, right around a billion
We on it, that mean we living for the moment
That mean she'll fuck 'til the morning, time and I got time
And I know that I'm in a position of controlling
Anything out by that ocean
I'm a boss, I'll buy that ocean, ain't nobody fucking with this

[Kendrick Lamar:]
They want that shit, they often fiend
I give it to 'em, but in between
My time, I gotta tie shoestrings
Life's a trip when you want these things
I often slip and then I lean
Toward three Ws in life
You know blow job need an application
Eating pussy make appetite
And yeah, my type, I like 'em brown
Just like my drink, the fuck you think?
I don't fuck with no hand-me-downs
See if you fuck, then it's after me
You know how much I'ma make it work?
You know her dress livin' in her purse
When you discuss your love for lust
Just make sure you visit here first: Cali

You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
Texas, I be screwed up, Chi-Town, I be really pimpin'
But nothing like my hometown, I'm forever livin'

[Kendrick Lamar:]
So I'm saying, "What up? What up? Nigga, you made it"
So I'm saying, "What up? What up? Nigga, you made it"
So I'm saying, "What up? What up? Nigga, you made it"
So I'm saying, "What up? What up? Nigga, I hate it"
So I'm saying, "What up? What up? Nigga, I hate it"
Frustrated and I'm riding down them back streets
Making my conscience ask me
"Will I survive to make it up out this hole in time?"
Black boy fly, black boy fly
Black, black boy fly, black boy fly

I used to be jealous of Arron Afflalo
I used to be jealous of Arron Afflalo
He was the one to follow
He was the only leader foreseeing brighter tomorrows
He would live in the gym, we was living in sorrow
Total envy of him, he made his dream become a reality
Actually making it possible to swim
His way up outta Compton with further more to accomplish
Graduate with honors, a sponsor of basketball scholars
It's 2004 and I'm watching him score thirty
Remember vividly how them victory points had hurt me
'Cause every basket was a reaction or a reminder
That we was just moving backwards
The bungalow where you find us
The art of us ditching classes, heading nowhere fast
Stick my head inside the study hall, he focused on math
Determination ambition, plus dedication and wisdom
Qualities he was given was the shit we didn't have
Dug inside of his book bag and Coach Palmer asked for his finals
He had his back like a spinal, meanwhile
We singing the same old song spinning the vinyl
Eleven graders gone wrong
He focused on the NBA, we focused on some Patron
Now watch that black boy fly

[Anna Wise:]
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
Black boy

[Kendrick Lamar:]
I used to be jealous of Jayceon
I used to be jealous of Jayceon Taylor when I was young
Taylor made a career out of music from writing songs
A Buick had driven past bumping him when I mowed the lawn
Money laundering hustling, homies pondering up against
Schemes to make a million even if doing you harm
War's the case and just in case you wasn't alarmed
The city had fought with firearms and many had died before dawn
It's 2004 and I'm hearing the people roar
For the name of The Game, they line in front of the store
Swap meets, selling our mixtapes, I'm like, "Oh shit, wait"
Don't wanna be another nigga stuck regretting mistakes
Mixed feelings was my opinion, I was defending my insecurities
Chillin' my conscience next to a villain
Compton made you believe success wasn't real
Be honest, none of us knew of a record deal
So as I peel through these lottery tickets
I see a Harley Davidson truck visit the same plaza we shopped
A tall nigga hopped out with Jordans and a white tank top
He was top of the rap game, we was the top of the block
So watch that black boy fly

[Anna Wise:]
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
Black boy

[Kendrick Lamar:]
My mama didn't raise me up to be jealous-hearted
Like most of the winners call it
Regardless of where you stay, hold your head and continue marching
That's what she said, but in my head I wanted to be like Jordan
Award touring the country with money from mic recording
The only way out the ghetto, you know the stereotype
Shooting hoops or live on the stereo like Top 40
And shortly, I got discouraged
Like every time I walked to the corner, had them guns bursting
Nigga, I was rehearsing in repetition the phrase
That only one in a million will ever see better days
Especially when the crime waves was bigger than tsunamis
Break your boogie boards to pieces, you just a typical homie
All these niggas facetious and they all standing beside me
They all'll buy me a chopper if any one of you try me
What am I to do when every neighborhood is an obstacle?
When two niggas making it out had never sounded logical?
Three niggas making it out? That's mission impossible
So I never believed the type of performance that I could do
I wasn't jealous 'cause of the talents they got
I was terrified they'd be the last black boys to fly out of Compton
Thank God
(Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly)


[Kendrick Lamar:]
We on?
Aight
1, 2, 3, go!

Waking up in a dream
Sleepwalking on another big stage
You never heard peace 'til you hear people scream
Your name in unison, I'm so far away
From the place I used to be, struggling usually
Look at the newer me, fate pursuing me
I can feel the energy in the air
It feel like I'm supposed to be here

[Mary J. Blige:]
Everywhere I go I'm getting so much love
Fans, the stars, everyone
Saying how they can't wait for the LP
And I'm gonna blow
They believe in me
Feel so good in what you do
Helps somebody else get through
That's why I do the best I can
Because I know how blessed I am

I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I shine so bright I light the night
And it feels so right, ain't nothing better

[Kendrick Lamar:]
A fool if I take it all for granted
A smart man if I keep my feet planted
To the earth 'cause the people that hurt can understand it
You speakin' outlandish
I'mma show you how to make it all work
Another planet, it's a short-term goal for me
A record sold for me
It's just more of me in your ear
For you to hear Kendrick persevere
Defenses I feel relentless
Ambition with a clear vision
Takin' off I ain't taking off these Pistons
I'm takin' off on the inner me - you're distance
Came across me, how much it'a cost me
To get you out my business
I said a planet is a short-term goal, no sky is the limit
I'm past that, now pass that
Award, not one but four
Times two plus yours

[Mary J. Blige:]
I see myself performing there, (K.dot)
Sold out shows where the room is packed
Sitting at the Grammies, winning five awards
See myself on big billboards
Traveling around the world with endorsement deals
Can't imagine how it feels
That's why I'm smiling everyday
Because my dream ain't far away

I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I shine so bright I light the night
And it feels so right, ain't nothing better

[Kendrick Lamar:]
You looking at me and you tell me I'm blessed
Calculated my steps, my heart, my breath
Breathe in lungs of a victory and vividly
You see me when at my best, my worst
This verse dedicated to the days that I slept
With a curse research my paid dues I'm reimbursed
I burst in the crowd with a voice and a crown
I'm a king on the prowl and I see mama smile?
And I vow on the tape that I'll never break
You can break bread with me now
We can all take a bow on the edge of the pedestal
Then scream out loud that we made it off the avenue
And walked that mile
In the darkness I often sit back
And get lost in the rap that I wrote
When you told me that it spoke to your soul
I was talking to you
I was walking it through every ghetto
Tell success hello
We here

[Mary J. Blige:]
And I'm so happy I cry
'Cause I can't believe
All the things I ever wanted
Are finally happening for me
And it's so surreal
That I almost feel
That any minute I can wake up
From this fantasy
When you pray so hard
And you've come so far
And you know that it's the time for you to lift your bar
And I'm gonna do it
Watch me!

I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I shine so bright I light the night
And it feels so right, ain't nothing better
I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I shine so bright I light the night
And it feels so right, ain't nothing better


[Kent Jamz:]
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth?
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth?

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Momma take this motherfuckin' block off
Tryna reach you every day, collect calls
Never get through, and I go through withdrawals
Say who told you that I wanted this door
To slam shut, I just wanted to vent or
Ask you if you give me your rent for
A attorney, I can pay you back more
Soon as I get out, yeah, every rack is yours
Commissary running low, I need help
Not too much, I hustle up the rest myself
K. Dot wrote me saying Marcus got killed
If you knew me, then you know how bad I feel
Quisha prove me wrong, and never came to visit
And I heard she fucking on some other nigga
And my niggas left me in the dark, blind
Mama just get back at me this last time

[Kent Jamz:]
Men lie, wo- women lie
Men lie, wo- women
Men lie, wo- women lie
Men lie, wo- women
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth?

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Mama, take this motherfuckin' block off
That's on the date the day I take the block off
Pulled up, and they put me in them cop cars
Please believe me, this ain't easy by far
You forgot you're talking to your only son
'Member when you put me in that relay run
I was racing, chasing dreams to be the best
You had taught me that the very day I won
All I need is you to give me same support
Investigation saying that the same report
From a witness just might testify in court
DA say I take a deal, or take a loss
I ain't built for all them goddamn numbers
God's will, say a prayer for me mama
If you can't, then open up the phone lines
Mama just get back at me this last time

[Kent Jamz:]
Men lie, wo- women lie
Men lie, wo- women
Men lie, wo- women lie
Men lie, wo- women
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth?

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Dante, if I stress to take the block off
That's the day the state had take them locks off
I could only help but do so much
Bettering yourself, your own crutch
Look at your reflection, tell me who you see
Who is your protection? G-O-D
No, it's not neglection, I have just accepted
Your fate and what it's gon' be
'Member all the nights that I cried
Thinkin' that my only son just died
Peeking through the window, kickin' through the door
It's you they looking for, raid outside
Rather see you locked up than dead
Only you would say that I'm selfish
So before I take the stand and put this bible in my hand
Son, let me say this

[Kent Jamz:]
Men lie, wo- women lie
Men lie, wo- women
Men lie, wo- women lie
Men lie, wo- women
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth?


Greeting boys and girls (Greetings boys and girls)

Kendrick's childhood imaginary friend (That's right, that's right, that's right)
I am your neighbor (I am your neighbor)
And I'd like to welcome you to good kid, m.A.A.d city (good kid, m.A.A.d city)
So grab your cartoons and cereal (And sing)
Your pop guns and fireworks (And sing)

Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane, yeah

Kendrick, you remember that one time when we was
I've been waiting on this day since Dr. Dre and Pac
Was on Rosecrans in that burger stand at '95
People staring at 'em in amazement
Reservations at the Days Inn
We was living out a hotel at the time
Breakfast, lunch and dinner, chicken from Kentucky Fried
Mama babysitting Section 8 vouchers the move
When nothing else to lose but a burger flipping job
Close my eyes inside the swap meet and imagine it's a mansion
Gold ballroom, AK-47 dancin'
Howling at the moon, what's a pack of hungry babies?
Hope you feed us soon, bite your back, you die of rabies
Every day, we pray to eat at the table at Sizzlers
But never make the visit, if better days was on its way
Then they make the decision, to make the wrong turn
So for now we heat this skillet so this canned food can burn
Oh yeah, I remember that, it- it was the ravioli with the hot sauce in it, right?

When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million
Am I right?
Spend it all in front of the county building
Oh!
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane, yeah
Don't forget to sing along by the way, sing along

When we grow up, when we grow up (Aye, oh)

Nigga you remember the smoke and the burning buildings and shit?
Couple stolen TVs and a seat belt for my safety (Uh-huh)
Played the passenger I think it's five years after eighty (Yeah, yeah that)
Seven, do the math, '92, don't you be lazy (I won't)
Looking out the window, notice all the essentials
Of a block party that stop for a second, then it rekindle
Like a flame from a trick candle, everybody got dental
Insurance 'cause we 'bout to floss, you get that couch I sent you?
I heard that from a block away, probably had credentials
Of a scholar but, shit, not today, them Dayton Spokes was his to take
Refrigerators, barbecue pits, and Jordan kicks
They did invasions while helicopters recorded it
Hello Mi-Mister Miyagi, I want them Kenwood woofers
Say that you got me, if not, I'll dig in your drawer for it
The swap meet was the bull's eye like Tauruses
Murder was the melody you should know what the chorus is
"Papa, you really telling me we can just get some more of it
If we run out?" He said, "Lil' nigga, today the poor is rich
Don't tell your mom that you seen a Molotov bomb
If she ask just know you have to lie and son don't forget
Bitches ain't shit, hoes ain't neither
Niggas gon' snitch, watch the company you keeping
And one day you'll put money in the ghetto when you got it
Rather than having to hustle off these Rodney King riots"
That- that's right the motherfuckin' Rodney King
You was with your daddy on Bullis Road

When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million
That's crazy
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane
Don't forget, still sing along kids, still sing along
When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million
Please sing
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane


[Ab-Soul:]
Players always trying to pop bottles
Niggas love to pop bottles
Then get you a table my nigga
Get you a table my nigga

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Pour up, drank, head shot, drank
Sit down, drank, stand up, drank
Pass out, drank, wake up, drank
Faded, drank, faded, drank

[Jay Rock:]
No syrup in this cup but this that po' up
When you see me po' up, turn up 'til you throw up
Like a bulimic fiending, for hurl over them toilets
If I run out of liquor in your city, yo where the store at?
One bottle, two bottles I'm a soldier, never sober
Cup runneth over, don't give a fuck about cirrhosis
One life, that's all we have, OK let's toast to that
Then dive in a pool full of liquor
Swim laps like Michael Phelps

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Nigga, why you babysitting only two or three shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor I'mma dive in it

Pour up, drank, head shot, drank
Sit down, drank, stand up, drank
Pass out, drank, wake up, drank
Faded, drank, faded, drank

[Ab Soul:]
Used to wake up every morning to a glass of Alize
Hope this dollar shot of E&J will take the pain away
Aim and shoot, shots of Ciroc will make the girls get loose
With it we all trippin' off the hen like a female chicken
You with it? (Soulo)
Spread your wings, you probably won't get far
I honestly wouldn't advise operating a car
Try not to let the peer pressure get the best of ya
And end up giving it up in a restroom like the rest of us

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor I'mma dive in it

Pour up, drank, head shot, drank
Sit down, drank, stand up, drank
Pass out, drank, wake up, drank
Faded, drank, faded, drank

[ScHoolboy Q:]
So it's that groovy little nigga
Known for popping them bottles
Under my pants be a golden dick
Bitch, everything about me solid
Burberry nigga, them be my draws
Alexander McQueen in closets
Swagged out king, yeah, nigga, I'm Puff, uh
Have that pussy throbbing
Someone tell me where the drugs at, I'm into that
Twisting off them molly caps
Ciroc too don't fuck with Goose
Can I get a shot, swim in your juice
Worth a stack a minute, every day that shit repeat
I ain't tryna sweep you off your feet
Bitch, did you see your tab receipt?

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Nigga why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor I'mma dive in it

Pour up, drank, head shot, drank
Sit down, drank, stand up, drank
Pass out, drank, wake up, drank
Faded, drank, faded, drank

(Sherane)
Aw man... where is she taking me
Where is she taking me

All I, all I, all I, all I
All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane
Tell me do that sound familiar?
If it do then you're like me
Making excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of the bottle
And the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release
Everything that corrode inside of me
I see you joking, why you laugh?
Don't you feel bad?
I probably sleep, and never ever wake up
Never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust
But just when I thought I had enough

More, more, bless me more
We gon' drink this motherfucker down, more
Bottoms up then we pass it 'round, more
Fill it up more, not enough, more
Bless me more
We gon' drink this motherfucker down, more
Bottoms up then we pass it 'round, more
Fill it up more, not enough, more
Fill it up more, not enough, more
Fill it up more, not enough, more


[Sample:]

Every morning nigga I get blazed, aye
Women, weed, and weather nigga if you bored come and join the wave, aye
Girl what is your name 'cause I'm feeling your frame, can I see what you 'bout, uh
A little something in your rear, little something in your mouth, little something on your couch, uh
Know what I'm talking about, bring the coffin out
'Cause I killed it, I done drilled it
She said she like it from the back like a real bitch, uh
She swallowed my pride, I damn near cried
Yo I can't reply, she curled my toes and crossed my eyes
But when you got the recipe it's no surprise
Bad hoes panties get left behind, I want your behind

[Kendrick Lamar:]
You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss

No way hell no, uh uh
If I'm wrong I don't wanna be right
We want to be on, to peak on the chart
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts

[Sample of Boris Gardiner:]
Every nigga is a star, ayy, every nigga is a star
Every nigga is a star, ayy, every nigga is a star
Every nigga is a star, ayy
Who will deny that you and I and every nigga is a star?

[Josef Leimberg:]
Hit me!
When the four corners of this cocoon collide
You'll slip through the cracks hopin' that you'll survive
Gather your wit, take a deep look inside
Are you really who they idolize?
To pimp a butterfly

[Kendrick Lamar:]
At first, I did love you
But now I just wanna fuck
Late nights thinkin' of you
Until I get my nut
Tossed and turned, lesson learned
You was my first girlfriend
Bridges burned, all across the board
Destroyed, but what for?

When I get signed, homie, I'ma act a fool
Hit the dance floor, strobe lights in the room
Snatch your little secretary bitch for the homies
Blue-eyed devil with a fat-ass monkey
I'ma buy a brand new Caddy on vogues
Chunk the hood up, two times, deuce-four
Platinum on everythin', platinum on weddin' ring
Married to the game and a bad bitch chose
When I get signed, homie, I'ma buy a strap
Straight from the CIA, set it on my lap
Take a few M-16s to the hood
Pass 'em all out on the block, what's good?
I'ma put the Compton swap meet by the White House
Republican run up, get socked out
Hit the press with a Cuban link on my neck
Uneducated, but I got a million-dollar check like that

[Thundercat & George Clinton:]
We should never gave
We should never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home
We should never gave
We should never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home
(Everybody get out)

[Kendrick Lamar (Thundercat) {George Clinton}:]
At first, I did love you (Love you)
But now I just wanna fuck {I just wanna fuck}
Late nights thinkin' of you (Of you)
Until I get my nut {'Til I get my nut}
Tossed and turned, lesson learned
You was my first girlfriend
Bridges burned, all across the board (Across the board)
Destroyed, but what for?

[Dr. Dre:]
Yo, what's up? It's Dre
Remember the first time you came out to the house?
You said you wanted a spot like mine
But remember, anybody can get it
The hard part is keepin' it, motherfucker

[Kendrick Lamar:]
What you want you? A house or a car?
Forty acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?
Anythin', see, my name is Uncle Sam, I'm your dog
Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
I know your kind (That's why I'm kind)
Don't have receipts (Oh, man, that's fine)
Pay me later, wear those gators
Cliché? Then say, "Fuck your haters"
I can see the baller in you, I can see the dollar in you
Little white lies, but it's no white-collar in you
But it's whatever though because I'm still followin' you
Because you make me live forever, baby
Count it all together, baby
Then hit the register and make me feel better, baby
Your horoscope is a Gemini, two sides
So you better cop everything two times
Two coupes, two chains, two C-notes
Too much ain't enough, both we know
Christmas, tell 'em what's on your wish list
Get it all, you deserve it, Kendrick
And when you hit the White House, do you
But remember, you ain't pass economics in school
And everything you buy, taxes will deny
I'll Wesley-Snipe your ass before thirty-five

[George Clinton (Kendrick Lamar):]
Yeah, lookin' down, it's quite a drop (It's quite a drop, drop, drop)
Lookin' good when you're on top (When you're on top, you got it)
You got a medal for us
Leavin' metaphors metaphysically in a state of euphoria
Look both ways before you cross my mind

[Thundercat & George Clinton:]
We should never gave
We should never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home
We should never gave
We should never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home

[Anna Wise & Whitney Alford:]
Tax man comin', tax man comin'
Tax man comin', tax man comin'
Tax man comin', tax man comin'
Tax man comin', tax man comin'


[Darlene Tibbs:]
Fuck you, motherfucker, you a ho-ass nigga
I don't know why you trying to go big, nigga, you ain't shit
Walking around like you God's gift to Earth, nigga, you ain't shit
You ain't even buy me no outfit for the Fourth
I need that Brazilian, wavy, twenty-eight inch, you playin'
I shouldn't be fuckin' with you anyway
I need a baller-ass, boss-ass nigga
You's a off-brand-ass nigga, everybody know it
Your homies know it, everybody fuckin' know
Fuck you, nigga, don't call me no more
You won't know, you gonna lose on a good bitch
My other nigga is on, you off
What the fuck is really going on?

[Kendrick Lamar:]
This dick ain't free
You lookin' at me like it ain't a receipt
Like I never made ends meet
Eating your leftovers and raw meat
This dick ain't free
Livin' in captivity raised my cap salary
Celery, tellin' me green is all I need
Evidently, all I seen was Spam and raw sardines
This dick ain't free, I mean, baby
You really think we could make a baby named Mercedes
Without a Mercedes Benz and twenty-four-inch rims
Five percent tint, and air conditioning vents?
Hell fuckin' naw, this dick ain't free
I need forty acres and a mule
Not a forty ounce and a pitbull
Bullshit, matador, matador
Had the door knockin', let 'em in, who's that?
Genital's best friend, this dick ain't free
Pity the fool that made the pretty in you prosper
Titty juice and pussy lips kept me obnoxious
Kept me up watchin' pornos in poverty; apology? No
Watch you politic with people less fortunate, like myself
Every dog has its day, now doggy style shall help
This dick ain't free
Matter of fact, it need interest
Matter of fact, it's nine inches
Matter of fact, see our friendship based on business
Pension, more pension, you're pinchin' my percents
It's been relentless, fuck forgiveness, fuck your feelings
Fuck your sources, all distortion, if you fuck it's more abortion
More divorce courts and portion
My check with less endorsement left me dormant
Dusted, doomed, disgusted, forced with
Fuck you think is in more shit?
Porcelain pipes pressure, bust 'em twice
Choice is devastated, decapitated the horseman
Oh America, you bad bitch, I picked cotton and made you rich
Now my dick ain't free

[Darlene Tibbs:]
I'ma get my Uncle Sam to fuck you up
You ain't no king


[Kendrick Lamar:]
I got a bone to pick
I don't want you monkey-mouth motherfuckers
Sittin' in my throne again
Ayy, ayy, nigga, what's happenin'?
K-Dot back in the hood, nigga!
I'm mad (He mad!), but I ain't stressin'
True friends, one question

Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams—(What's the yams?)

The yam is the power that be
You can smell it when I'm walkin' down the street
(Oh yes, we can, oh yes, we can)
I can dig rappin', but a rapper with a ghostwriter?
What the fuck happened? (Oh no!)
I swore I wouldn't tell, but most of y'all sharing bars
Like you got the bottom bunk in a two-man cell (A two-man cell)
Something's in the water (Something's in the water)
And if I gotta brown-nose for some gold
Then I'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller (Oh yeah!)

Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
King Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams—(What's the yams?)

The yam brought it out of Richard Pryor
Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires
Twenty-four-seven, three-sixty-five days times two
I was contemplatin' gettin' off stage
Just to go back to the hood, see my enemy, and say... (Oh yeah)

Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him

You goat-mouth mammyfucker
I was gonna kill a couple rappers, but they did it to themselves
Everybody's suicidal, they ain't even need my help
This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin', "Compton!"
I should probably run for mayor when I'm done, to be honest
And I put that on my mamma and my baby boo too
Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin', woo-woo!
Aw, yeah, fuck the judge
I made it past twenty-five, and there I was
A little nappy-headed nigga with the world behind him
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina
Screamin', "Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?"
Limo tinted with the gold plates
Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king (Oh yeah)

Bitch, where you when I was walkin'—
By the time you hear the next pop
The funk shall be within you—
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
King Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him

[Kendrick Lamar (Whitney Alford):]
(Funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk)
We want the funk
We want the funk
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it?)
We want the funk
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it?)
We want the funk
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it?)
We want the funk
(Do you want the funk?)
We want the funk
(Do you want the funk?)
We want the funk
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it?)
We want the funk

[Kendrick Lamar:]
I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence


[Part I]

[Kendrick Lamar:]
What money got to do with it
When I don't know the full definition of a rap image?
I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it
Institutionalized, I keep runnin' back for a visit, hol' up
Get it back
I said I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it
Institutionalized, I could still kill me a nigga, so what?

[Anna Wise & Bilal:]
If I was the president
I'd pay my mama's rent
Free my homies and them
Bulletproof my Chevy doors
Lay in the White House and get high, Lord
Whoever thought?
Master, take the chains off me!

[Part II]

[Taz Arnold:]
Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom
Zoom, zoom, zoom
Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom
Zoom, zoom, zoom
Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom
Zoom, zoom, zoom
Zoom, zoom, zoom, shit

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Life, to me, like a box of chocolate
Quid pro quo, somethin' for somethin', that's the obvious
Oh shit, flow's so sick, don't you swallow it
Bitin' my style, you're salmonella-poison positive
I can just alleviate the rap industry politics
Milk the game up, never lactose intolerant
The last remainder of real shit, you know the obvious
Me, scholarship? No, streets put me through colleges
Be all you can be, true, but the problem is
Dream only a dream if work don't follow it
Remind me of the homies that used to know me, now follow this
I'll tell you my hypothesis, I'm probably just way too loyal
K Dizzle will do it for you, my niggas think I'm a god
Truthfully all of 'em spoiled, usually, you're never charged
But somethin' came over you once I took you to them fuckin' BET Awards
You lookin' at artistses like they're harvestses
So many Rollies around you and you want all of 'em
Somebody told me you thinkin' 'bout snatchin' jewelry
I should've listened when my grandmama said to me:

[Bilal:]
"Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, boy
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Oh now, slow down"

[Snoop Dogg:]
And once upon a time, in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
He was five-foot somethin', God bless the kid
Took his homies to the show and this is what they said:

[Kendrick Lamar:]
"Fuck am I 'posed to do when I'm lookin' at walkin' licks?
The constant big money talk 'bout the mansion and foreign whips
The private jets and passport, presidential glass floor
Gold bottles, gold models, givin' up the ass for
Instagram flicks, suckin' dick, fuck is this?
One more sucker wavin' with a flashy wrist
My defense mechanism tell me to get him
Quickly because he got it
It's a recession, then why the fuck he at King of Diamonds?
No more livin' poor, meet my four-four
When I see 'em, put the per diem on the floor
Now Kendrick, know they're your co-workers
But it's gon' take a lot 'fore this pistol go cold turkey
Now I can watch his watch on the TV and be okay
But see I'm on the clock once that watch landin' in LA
Remember steal from the rich and givin' it back to the poor?
Well, that's me at these awards"
I guess my grandmama was warnin' a boy
She said

[Bilal:]
"Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, boy
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Oh now, slow down"

[Snoop Dogg:]
And once upon a time, in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
He was five-foot something, dazed and confused
Talented but still under the neighborhood ruse
You can take your boy out the hood
But you can't take the hood out the homie
Took his show money, stashed it in the mozey wozey
Hollywood's nervous
Fuck you, goodnight, thank you much for your service


[Kendrick Lamar:]
I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence
Sometimes, I did the same

[Kendrick Lamar (Anna Wise):]
(Woman moaning)
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
(If these walls could talk)
(Sex)

[Anna Wise (Kendrick Lamar):]
She just want to close her eyes and sway
With you, with you, with you (Ah, come on)
Exercise her right to work it out
It's true, it's true, it's true
Shout out to the birthday girls
Say hey hey, say hey hey, (Ah, girl)
Everyone deserves a night to play, play
She plays, only when you tell her no

[Anna Wise, Thundercat (Bilal):]
If these walls could talk
(I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you)
If these walls could talk
(I love it when I'm in it, I love it when I'm in it)

[Kendrick Lamar:]
If these walls could talk, they'd tell me to swim good
No boat, I float better than he would
No life jacket, I'm not the God of Nazareth
But your flood can be misunderstood
Walls telling me they full of pain, resentment
Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension
Me, I'm just a tenant
Landlord said these walls vacant more than a minute
These walls are vulnerable, exclamation
Interior pink, color coordinated
I interrogated every nook and cranny
I mean, it's still amazing, before they couldn't stand me
These walls want to cry tears
These walls happier when I'm here
These walls never could hold up
Every time I come around, demolition might crush

[Anna Wise, Thundercat (Bilal):]
If these walls could talk
(I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you)
If these walls could talk
(I love it when I'm in it, I love it when I'm in it)

[Kendrick Lamar:]
If these walls could talk, they'd tell me to go deep
Yelling at me continuously, I can see
Your defense mechanism is my decision
Knock these walls down, that's my religion
Walls feeling like they ready to close in
I suffocate, then catch my second wind
I resonate in these walls
I don't know how long I can wait in these walls
I've been on the streets too long
Looking at you from the outside in
They sing the same old song
About how they walls always the cleanest
I beg to differ, I must've missed them
I'm not involved, I'd rather diss 'em
I'd rather call on you, put your wall up
'Cause when I come around, demolition gon' crush

[Anna Wise, Thundercat (Bilal):]
If these walls could talk
(I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you)
If these walls could talk
(I love it when I'm in it, I love it when I'm in it)

[Kendrick Lamar:]
If your walls could talk, they'd tell you it's too late
Your destiny accepted your fate
Burn accessories and stash them on the yard
Take the recipe, the Bible and God
Wall telling you that commissary is low
Race wars happening, no calling CO
No calling your mother to save you
Homies to say you're irrepetible, not acceptable
Your behavior is Sammy the Bull like
A killer that turned snitch
Walls is telling me you a bitch
You pray for appeals hoping the warden would afford them
That sentence so important
Walls telling you to listen to "Sing About Me"
Retaliation is strong, you even dream 'bout me
Killed my homeboy and God spared your life
Dumb criminal got indicted same night
So when you play this song, rewind the first verse
About me abusing my power so you can hurt
About me and her in the shower whenever she horny
About me and her in the after hours of the morning
About her baby daddy currently serving life
And how she think about you until we meet up at night
About the only girl that cared about you when you asked her
And how she fuckin' on a famous rapper
Walls can talk (Talk)

I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in a hotel room


[Kendrick Lamar:]
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated

I place blame on you still, place shame on you still
Feel like you ain't shit, feel like you don't feel
Confidence in yourself, breakin' on marble floors
Watchin' anonymous strangers, tellin' me that I'm yours
But you ain't shit, I'm convinced your tolerance nothin' special
What can I blame you for? Nigga, I can name several
Situations, I'll start with your little sister bakin'
A baby inside, just a teenager, where your patience?
Where was your antennas?
Where was the influence you speak of?
You preached in front of one-hunnid-thousand but never reached her
I fuckin' tell you fuckin' failure—you ain't no leader!
I never liked you, forever despise you—I don't need ya!
The world don't need ya, don't let them deceive ya
Numbers lie too, fuck your pride too, that's for dedication
Thought money would change you, made you more complacent
Fuckin' hate you, I hope you embrace it, I swear—

Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated

Lovin' you, lovin' you, not lovin' you, 100° proof
I can feel your vibe and recognize that you're ashamed of me
Yes, I hate you, too

[Jessica Vielmas:]
(Loving you ain't really complicated)
"Housekeeping, housekeeping"
(What I got to do to get to you?)
"¡Abre la puerta! ¡Abre la puerta tengo que limpiar el cuarto!"
(To you)
"¡Es que no hay mucho tiempo tengo que limpiar el cuarto!"
(Loving you ain't really complicated)
"¡Disculpe!"
(What I got to do to get to you?)
(To you)

[Kendrick Lamar:]
And you the reason why mom and them leavin'
No, you ain't shit, you say you love 'em, I know you don't mean it
I know you irresponsible, selfish, in denial, can't help it
Your trials and tribulations a burden, everyone felt it
Everyone heard it, multiple shots, corners cryin' out
You was deserted, where was your antennas again?
Where was your presence? Where was your support that you pretend?
You ain't no brother, you ain't no disciple, you ain't no friend
A friend never leave Compton for profit, or leave his best friend, little brother
You promised you'd watch him before they shot him
Where was your antennas? On the road, bottles and bitches
You FaceTimed him one time, that's unforgiven
You even FaceTimed instead of a hospital visit
Guess you thought he'd recover well
Third surgery, they couldn't stop the bleeding for real
Then he died, God himself will say, "You fuckin' failed," you ain't try

I know your secrets, nigga, mood swings is frequent, nigga
I know depression is restin' on your heart for two reasons, nigga
I know you and a couple block boys ain't been speakin', nigga
Y'all damn near beefin', I see it and you're the reason, nigga
And if this bottle could talk 
I cry myself to sleep, bitch, everything is your fault
Faults breakin' to pieces, earthquakes on every weekend
Because you shook as soon as you knew confinement was needed
I know your secrets, don't let me tell 'em to the world
About that shit you thinkin' and that time you I'm 'bout to hurl
I'm fucked up, but I ain't as fucked up as you
You just can't get right, I think your heart made of bullet proof
Should've killed yo' ass long time ago
You should've felt that black revolver blast a long time ago
And if these mirrors could talk it'd say, "You gotta go"
And if I told your secrets the world'll know money can't stop a suicidal weakness


[Kendrick Lamar:]
Alls my life, I has to fight, nigga
Alls my life, I—
Hard times like, "Yah!"
Bad trips like, "Yah!"
Nazareth
I'm fucked up, homie, you fucked up
But if God got us, then we gon' be alright

[Pharrell Williams:]
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Uh, and when I wake up
I recognize you're looking at me for the pay cut
But homicide be looking at you from the face down
What MAC-11 even boom with the bass down?
Schemin', and let me tell you 'bout my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight
Now tell my mamma I love her, but this what I like, Lord knows
Twenty of 'em in my Chevy, tell 'em all to come and get me
Reaping everything I sow, so my karma coming heavy
No preliminary hearings on my record
I'm a motherfucking gangster in silence for the record, uh
Tell the world I know it's too late
Boys and girls, I think I've gone cray
Drown inside my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I say

Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before
Nigga, when our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, "Where do we go?"
Nigga, and we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street for sure
Nigga, I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow
But we gon' be alright

[Pharrell Williams:]
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright

[Kendrick Lamar:]
What you want you, a house? You, a car?
Forty acres and a mule? A piano, a guitar?
Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog
Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
I can see the evil, I can tell it, I know it's illegal
I don't think about it, I deposit every other zero
Thinking of my partner, put the candy, paint it on the Regal
Digging in my pocket, ain't a profit big enough to feed you
Every day my logic get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your chico, ah!
I don't talk about it, be about it, every day I sequel
If I got it then you know you got it, Heaven, I can reach you
Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, my dog, that's all
Bick back and Chad, I trap the bag for y'all
I rap, I black on track so rest assured
My rights, my wrongs; I write 'til I'm right with God

Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before
Nigga, when our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, "Where do we go?"
Nigga, and we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street for sure
Nigga, I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow
But we gon' be alright

[Pharrell Williams:]
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright

[Kendrick Lamar & Thundercat:]
I keep my head up high
I cross my heart and hope to die
Lovin' me is complicated
Too afraid of a lot of changes
I'm alright, and you're a favorite
Dark nights in my prayers

[Kendrick Lamar:]
I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin' for answers


[Bilal:]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(Breathing)
What's wrong, nigga?
I thought you was keeping it gangsta
I thought this what you wanted
They say if you scared, go to church
But remember, he knows the Bible too

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Now, baby, when I get you, get you, get you, get you
I'ma go hit the throttle with you
Smoking, lokin', poking that doja 'til I'm idle with you
'Cause I (want you)
Now, baby, when I'm riding here, I'm riding dirty
Registration is out of service
Smoking, lokin', drinking that potion, you can see me swerving
'Cause I (want you)
(I want you more than you know)

I remember you took me to the mall last week, baby
You looked me in my eyes about four, five times
'Til I was hypnotized, then you clarified
That I (want you)
You said Sherane ain't got nothing on Lucy
I said, "You crazy?"
Roses are red, violets are blue
But me and you both pushing up daisies if I (want you)

Now, baby, when I get you, get you, get you, get you
I'ma go hit the throttle with you
Smoking, lokin', poking that doja 'til I'm idle with you
'Cause I (want you)

You said to me, you said your name was Lucy
I said, "Where's Ricardo?"
You said, "Oh, no, not the show"
Then you spit a little rap to me like this
When I turned twenty-six, I was like, "Oh, shit"
You said to me, I remember what you said too, you said:
"My name is Lucy, Kendrick, you introduced me, Kendrick
Usually I don't do this but I see you and me, Kendrick
Lucy give you no worries, Lucy got million stories
About these rappers that I came after when they was boring
Lucy gon' fill your pockets
Lucy gon' move your mama out of Compton
Inside the gigantic mansion like I promised
Lucy just want your trust and loyalty, avoiding me?
It's not so easy, I'm at these functions accordingly
Kendrick, Lucy don't slack a minute, Lucy work harder
Lucy gon' call you even when Lucy know you love your Father
I'm Lucy, I loosely heard prayers on your first album, truly
Lucy don't mind, 'cause at the end of the day you'll pursue me
Lucy go get it, Lucy not timid, Lucy up front
Lucy got paperwork on top of paperwork
I want you to know that Lucy got you
All your life I watched you
And now you all grown up to sign this contract, if that's possible"

Get you, get you, get you, get you
I'ma go hit the throttle with you
Smoking, lokin', poking that doja 'til I'm idle with you
'Cause I (want you)
Now, baby, when I'm riding here, I'm riding dirty
Registration is out of service
Smoking, lokin', drinking that potion, you can see me swerving
'Cause I (want you)

[Bilal:]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin' for answers
Until I came home


[Part I]

[Taz Arnold:]
Oh, shit!
I need that
I need that sloppy
That sloppy (Yo, yo, yo)
Like a Chevy in quicksand
Yeah
That sloppy

[Kendrick Lamar:]
This feelin' is unmatched
This feelin' is brought to you by adrenaline and good rap
Black Pendleton ball cap (West, west, west)
We don't share the same synonym, fall back (West, west, west)
Been in it before Internet had new acts
Mimicking radio's nemesis made me wack
My innocence limited, the experience lacked
Ten of us with no tentative tactic that cracked
The mind of a literate writer, but I did it, in fact
You admitted it once I submitted it, wrapped in plastic
Remember scribblin', scratchin' diligent sentences backwards
Visiting freestyle cyphers for your reaction
Now, I can live in a stadium, pack it the fastest
Gamblin' Benjamin benefits, sinnin' in traffic
Spinnin' women in cartwheels, linen fabric on fashion
Winnin' in every decision, Kendrick is master that mastered it
Isn't it lovely how menaces turned attraction?
Pivotin' rappers, finish your fraction while writing blue magic
Thank God for rap
I would say it got me a plaque, but what's better than that?
The fact it brought me back home

[Lalah Hathway & Taz Arnold:]
We been waitin' for you
Waitin' for you
Waitin' for you
Waitin' for you

[Kendrick Lamar:]
I know everything
I know everything, know myself
I know morality, spirituality, good and bad health
I know fatality might haunt you
I know everything
I know Compton, I know street shit, I know shit that's conscious
I know everything, I know lawyers, advertisement and sponsors
I know wisdom, I know bad religion, I know good karma
I know everything, I know history
I know the universe works mentally
I know the perks of bullshit isn't meant for me
I know everything, I know cars, clothes, hoes, and money
I know loyalty, I know respect, I know those that's ornery
I know everything, the highs, the lows, the groupies, the junkies
I know if I'm generous at heart, I don't need recognition
The way I'm rewarded—well, that's God's decision
I know you know that line's for Compton School District
Just give it to the kids, don't gossip 'bout how it was distributed
I know how people work
I know the price of life, I'm knowin' how much it's worth
I know what I know, and I know it well not to ever forget
Until I realized I didn't know shit, the day I came home

[Lalah Hathway & Taz Arnold:]
We been waitin' for you
Waitin' for you
Waitin' for you
Waitin' for you

[Kendrick Lamar:]
I met a little boy that resembled my features
Nappy afro, gap in his smile, hand-me-down sneakers
Bounced through the crowd
Run a number on man and woman that crossed him
Sun beamin' on his beady beads, exhausted
Tossin' footballs with his ashy, black ankles
Breakin' new laws mama passed on home trainin'
He looked at me and said, "Kendrick, you do know my language
You just forgot because of what public schools had painted
Oh, I forgot, "Don't Kill My Vibe", that's right, you're famous
I used to watch on Channel 5, TV was taken
But never mind, you're here right now, don't you mistake it
It's just a new trip, take a glimpse of your family ancestor
Make a new list of everything you thought was progress
And that was bullshit, I know your life is full of turmoil
Spoiled by fantasies of who you are, I feel bad for you
I can attempt to enlighten you without frightenin' you
If you resist, I'll back off quick, go catch a flight or two
But if you pick destiny over rest-in-peace
Then be an advocate, tell your homies, especially
To come back home"

[Part II]

This is a world premiere
This is a world premiere
This is a world premiere

[Kendrick Lamar:]
I been lookin' for you my whole life, an appetite
For the feeling I can barely describe, where you reside?
Is it in a woman, is it in money or mankind?
Tell me something, got me losing my mind, ah!

You make me wanna jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Let's talk about love
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Let's talk about love
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Let's talk about love
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Let's talk about love

I been lookin' for you my whole life, an appetite
For the feeling I can barely describe, where you reside?
Is it in a woman, is it in money, or mankind?
Tell me something, think I'm losing my mind, ah!

I say, where you at? From the front to the back
I'm lookin' for you, I react only when you react
Ah, I thought I found you, back in the ghetto
When I was seventeen with the .38 special
Maybe you're in a dollar bill, maybe you're not real
Maybe only the wealthy get to know how you feel
Maybe I'm paranoid, ha, maybe I don't need you anyway
Don't lie to me, I'm suicidal anyway
I can be your advocate
I can preach for you if you tell me what the matter is


K-Dot, pick up the phone, nigga
Every time I call, it's going to voicemail
Don't tell me they got you on some weirdo rap shit, nigga
No socks and skinny jeans and shit, ha
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Call me on Shaniqua's phone!

I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo-boo
Your home boy, your block that you're from, boo-boo
Lil hoes you went to school with, boo-boo
Baby mama and your new bitch, boo-boo
We was in the hood, 14 with the deuce-deuce
14 years later, going hard like we used to, on the dead homies
On the dead homies

I don't give a fuck about no politics in rap, my nigga
Our lil' homie Stunna Deuce ain't never comin' back, my nigga
So you better go hard every time you jump on wax, my nigga
Fuck what they talkin' 'bout, your shit is where it's at, my nigga
Came in this game, you stuck your fangs in this game
You wore no chain in this game, your hood, your name in this game
Now you double up, time to bubble up the bread and huddle up
Stickin' to the scripts, now, here, if them Benjamins go cuddle up
Skip, hop, drip, drop
Flip, flop with the white tube sock
It goes, "Sherm sticks, burn this"
That's what the product smell like when the chemicals mix
50-nigga salute, out the Compton zoo, with the extras
El Co's, Monte Carlos, Road Kings, and dressers
Rip Ridaz, P-Funkers, Mexicans, they fuck with you
Asians, they fuck with you, nobody can fuck with you

I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo-boo
Your homeboy, your block that you're from, boo-boo
Lil hoes you went to school with, boo-boo
Baby mama and your new bitch, boo-boo
We was in the hood, 14 with the deuce-deuce
14 years later, going hard like we used to, on the dead homies
On the dead homies

Hopped out the Caddy, just got my dick sucked
The little homies called and said, "The enemies done cliqued up"
Oh, yeah? Puto want to squabble with mi barrio?
Oh, yeah? Tell 'em they can run it for the cardio
Oh, yeah? Everything is everything, it's scandalous
Slow motion for the ambulance, the project filled with cameras
The LAPD gamblin', scramblin', football numbers slanderin'
Niggas' names on paper—you snitched all summer
Streets don't fail me now
They tell me it's a new gang in town
From Compton to Congress
Set-trippin' all around
Ain't nothin' new but a flu of new Demo-Crips and Re-Blood-icans
Red state versus a blue state—which one you governin'?
They give us guns and drugs, call us thugs
Make it they promise to fuck with you
No condom, they fuck with you, Obama say, "What it do?"

Obama say, "What it do?"
Obama say, "What it do?"
Obama say, "What it do?"

I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo-boo
Your homeboy, your block that you're from, boo-boo
Lil hoes you went to school with, boo-boo
Baby mama and your new bitch, boo-boo
We was in the hood, 14 with the deuce-deuce
14 years later, going hard like we used to, on the dead homies
On the dead homies

Everybody want to talk about who this and who that
Who the realest and who wack, or who white or who Black
Critics want to mention that they miss when hip-hop was rappin'
Motherfucker, if you did, then Killer Mike'd be platinum
Y'all priorities fucked up, put energy in wrong shit
Hennessy and Crown Vic, my memory been gone since
Don't ask about no camera blocking at award shows
No, don't ask about my bitch, no, don't ask about my Vogues
'Less you askin' me about power, yeah, I got a lot of it
I'm the only nigga next to Snoop that can push the button
Had the Coast on standby
"K. Dot, what up? I heard they opened up Pandora's box"
I box 'em all in, by a landslide
Nah, homie, we too sensitive, it spill out to the streets
I make the call and get the Coast involved, then history repeats
But I resolved inside that private hall while sitting down with Jay
He said, "It's funny how one verse could fuck up the game"

I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo-boo

I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in a hotel room
I didn't want to self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answers
Until I came home
But that didn't stop survivors guilt
Going back and forth
Trying to convince myself the stripes I earned
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was
But while my loved ones was fighting a continuous war
Back in the city
I was entering a new one


[Kendrick Lamar:]
How much a dollar really cost?
The question is detrimental, paralyzin' my thoughts
Parasites in my stomach keep me with a gut feeling, y'all
Gotta see how I'm chillin' once I park this luxury car
Hopping out feeling big as Mutombo
"20 on pump 6," dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo
Twenty years ago, can't forget
Now I can lend him a ear or two
How to stack these residuals tenfold
The liberal concept of what men'll do
"20 on 6," he didn't hear me
Indigenous African only spoke Zulu
My American tongue was leery
Walked out the gas station
A homeless man with a semi-tan complexion
Asked me for ten Rand, stressin' about dry land
Deep water, powder blue skies that crack open
A piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin'
He begged and pleaded
Asked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it
Told him, "Beat it"
Contributin' money just for his pipe—I couldn't see it
He said, "My son, temptation is one thing that I've defeated
Listen to me, I want a single bill from you
Nothin' less, nothin' more"
I told him I ain't have it and closed my door
Tell me, how much a dollar cost?

[James Fauntleroy:]
It's more to feed your mind
Water, sun and love, the one you love
All you need, the air you breathe

[Kendrick Lamar:]
He's starin' at me in disbelief
My temper is buildin', he's starin' at me, I grab my key
He's starin' at me, I started the car, then I tried to leave
And somethin' told me to keep it in park until I could see
The reason why he was mad at a stranger
Like I was supposed to save him
Like I'm the reason he's homeless and askin' me for a favor
He's starin' at me, his eyes followed me with no laser
He's starin' at me, I notice that his stare is contagious
'Cause now I'm starin' back at him, feelin' some type of disrespect
If I could throw a bat at him, it'd be aimin' at his neck
I never understood someone beggin' for goods
Askin' for handouts, takin' it if they could
And this particular person just had it down pat
Starin' at me for the longest until he finally asked
"Have you ever opened up Exodus 14?
A humble man is all that we ever need"
Tell me, how much a dollar cost?

[James Fauntleroy:]
It's more to feed your mind
Water, sun and love, the one you love
All you need, the air you breathe

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Guilt trippin' and feelin' resentment
I never met a transient that demanded attention
They got me frustrated, indecisive and power trippin'
Sour emotions got me lookin' at the universe different
I should distance myself, I should keep it relentless
My selfishness is what got me here, who the fuck I'm kiddin'?
So I'ma tell you like I told the last bum
Crumbs and pennies, I need all of mines
And I recognize this type of panhandlin' all the time
I got better judgment, I know when nigga's hustlin', keep in mind
When I was strugglin', I did compromise, now I comprehend
I smell Grandpa's old medicine, reekin' from your skin
Moonshine and gin, nigga you're babblin', your words ain't flatterin'
I'm imaginin' Denzel but lookin' at O'Neal
Kazaam is sad thrills, your gimmick is mediocre
The jig is up, I seen you from a mile away losin' focus
And I'm insensitive, and I lack empathy
He looked at me and said, "Your potential is bittersweet"
I looked at him and said, "Every nickel is mines to keep"
He looked at me and said, "Know the truth, it'll set you free
You're lookin' at the Messiah, the son of Jehovah, the higher power
The choir that spoke the word, the Holy Spirit
The nerve of Nazareth, and I'll tell you just how much a dollar cost
The price of having a spot in Heaven, embrace your loss—I am God"

[Ronald Isley:]
I washed my hands, I said my grace
What more do you want from me?
Tears of a clown, guess I'm not all what it's all meant to be
Shades of grey will never change if I condone
Turn this page, help me change to right my wrongs


[Pete Rock:]
I'm with this

Complexion (Two-step)
Complexion don't mean a thing (It's a Zulu love)
Ooh, complexion (Two-step)
It all feels the same (It's a Zulu love)

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Uh, dark as the midnight hour or bright as the mornin' sun
Give a fuck about your complexion, I know what the Germans done
Sneak (Dissin')
Sneak me through the back window, I'm a good field nigga
I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you
You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down
Even if master listenin', cover your ears, he 'bout to mention

[Pete Rock:]
Complexion (Two-step)
Complexion don't mean a thing (It's a Zulu love)
Ooh, complexion (Two-step)
It all feels the same (It's a Zulu love)

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Dark as the midnight hour, or bright as the mornin' sun
Brown skinned, but your blue eyes tell me your mama can't run
Sneak (Dissin')
Sneak me through the back window, I'm a good field nigga
I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you
You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down
Even if master's listenin', I got the world's attention
So I'ma say somethin' that's vital and critical for survival
Of mankind, a feline color should never rival
Beauty is what you make it, I used to be so mistaken
By different shades of faces
Then Whit' told me, "A woman is woman, love the creation"
It all came from God, then you was my confirmation
I came to where you reside
And looked around to see more sights for sore eyes
Let the Willie Lynch theory reverse a million times with

[Pete Rock:]
Complexion (Two-step)
Complexion don't mean a thing (It's a Zulu love)
Ooh, complexion (Two-step)
It all feels the same (It's a Zulu love)

[JaVonté & Kendrick Lamar:]
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
(Where the homegirl Rapsody at?
I need you to speak your mind real quick, loved one!)

[Rapsody:]
Let me talk my Stu Scott, 'scuse me on my 2Pac
Keep your head up, when did you stop loving thy
Color of your skin? Color of your eyes
That's the real blues, baby, like you met Jay's baby, uh
You blew me away, you think more beauty in blue, green and grey
All my solemn men up north, 12 years a slave
12 years of age, thinkin' my shade too dark
I love myself, I no longer need Cupid
Enforcin' my dark side like a young George Lucas
Light don't mean you smart, bein' dark don't make you stupid
And frame of mind for them busters, ain't talkin' "Woo-hah!"
Need a paradox for the pair of docs they tutored
Like two Todd's, L-L, you lose two times
If you don't see you beautiful in your complexion
It ain't complex to put it in context
Find the air beneath the kite, that's the context
Yeah, baby, I'm conscious, ain't no contest
If you like it, I love it, all your earth tones been blessed
Ain't no stress, jiggaboos wanna be
I ain't talkin' Jay, I ain't talkin' Bey
I'm talkin' days we got school watchin' movie screens
And spike your self-esteem
The new James Bond gon' be black as me
Black as brown, hazelnut, cinnamon, black tea
And it's all beautiful to me
Call your brothers magnificent, call all the sisters queens
We all on the same team, blues and pirus, know colors ain't a thing

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Barefoot babies with no care
Teenage gun toters that don't play fair, should I get out the car?
I don't see Compton, I see something much worse
The land of the landmines, the hell that's on earth


[Kendrick Lamar (Lalah Hathaway):]
Everything black, I don't want black (They want us to bow)
I want everything black, I ain't need black (Down to our knees)
Some white, some black, I ain't mean black (And pray to the God)
I want everything black (We don't believe)
Everything black, want all things black
I don't need black, want everything black
Don't need black, our eyes ain't black
I own black, own everything black

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Six in the morn'
Fire in the street
Burn, baby, burn (You, you, you, you, you)
That's all I wanna see (You, you, you, you, you)
And sometimes I get off watchin' you die in vain
It's such a shame, they may call me crazy
They may say I suffer from schizophrenia or somethin'
But homie, you made me (You, you, you, you, you)
black don't crack, my nigga

I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
Been feelin' this way since I was sixteen, came to my senses
You never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it
I'm African-American, I'm African, I'm black as the moon
Heritage of a small village, pardon my residence
Came from the bottom of mankind
My hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide
You hate me, don't you?
You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture
You're fuckin' evil
I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey
You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me
And this is more than confession
I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion
I'm guardin' my feelings, I know that you feel it
You sabotage my community, makin' a killin'
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot

[Assassin:]
I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black
Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black
And man a say they put me inna chains, cah' we black
Imagine now, big gold chains full of rocks
How you no see the whip, left scars 'pon me back
But now we have a big whip parked 'pon the block
All them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black
Remember this, every race start from the block, just 'member that

[Kendrick Lamar:]
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
I mean, it's evident that I'm irrelevant to society
That's what you're tellin' me, penitentiary would only hire me
Curse me 'til I'm dead, church me with your fake prophesizing
That I'ma be just another slave in my head
Institutionalized manipulation and lies
Reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes
You hate me, don't you?
I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself
Jealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt
Watchin' me as I pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out
Muscle cars like pull-ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout, ah
black and successful, this black man meant to be special
Katzkins on my radar, bitch, how can I help you?
How can I tell you I'm making a killin'?
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot

[Assassin:]
I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black
Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black
And man a say they put me inna chains, cah' we black
Imagine now, big gold chains full of rocks
How you no see the whip, left scars 'pon me back
But now we have a big whip parked 'pon the block
All them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black
Remember this, every race start from the block, just 'member that

[Kendrick Lamar:]
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
When I finish this, if you listen, then sure you will agree
This plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred
It's genocism, it's grimy, little justification
I'm African-American, I'm African
I'm black as the heart of a fuckin' Aryan
I'm black as the name of Tyrone and Darius, excuse my French
But fuck you—no, fuck y'all, that's as blunt as it gets
I know you hate me, don't you?
You hate my people, I can tell 'cause it's threats when I see you
I can tell 'cause your ways deceitful
Know I can tell because you in love with that Desert Eagle
Thinkin' maliciously, he get a chain then you gon' bleed him
It's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war
Two tribal armies that wanna build and destroy
Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next-door
Beefin' with Pirus, only death settle the score
So don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers
Or tell Georgia State "Marcus Garvey got all the answers"
Or try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day
Or eat watermelon, chicken, and Kool-Aid on weekdays
Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements
Or watch BET 'cause urban support is important
So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street
When gang-banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?
Hypocrite!


Study long, study wrong, nigga
Hey, y'all close that front door, y'all let flies in this motherfucker
Close that door!
My OG up in this motherfucker right now
My pops man with the bottle of Hennessy in his hand, actin' a fool
Hey, hey, babe, check it out, I'ma tell you what my mama had said, she like:

I could spot you a mile away
I could see your insecurities written all on your face
So predictable your words, I know what you gonna say
Who you foolin'? Oh, you assuming you can just come and hang
With the homies but your level of realness ain't the same
Circus acts only attract those that entertain
Small talk, we know that it's all talk
We live in the Laugh Factory every time they mention your name

Askin' "Where the hoes at?" to impress me
Askin' "Where the moneybags?" to impress me
Say you got the burner stashed to impress me
It's all in your head, homie
Askin' "Where the plug at?" to impress me
Askin' "Where the juug at?" to impress me
Askin' "Where it's at?" only upsets me
You sound like the feds, homie

You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard

And the world don't respect you
And the culture don't accept you
But you think it's all love
And the girls gon' neglect you once your parody is done
Reputation can't protect you if you never had one
Jealousy (Complex), emotional (Complex)
Self-pity (Complex), under oath (Complex)
The loudest one in the room, nigga, that's a complex
Let me put it back in proper context

You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard

Askin' "Where the hoes at?" to impress me
Askin' "Where the moneybags?" to impress me
Say you got the burner stashed to impress me
It's all in your head, homie
Askin' "Where the plug at?" to impress me
Askin' "Where the juug at?" to impress me
Askin' "Where it's at?" only upsets me
You sound like the feds, homie

(Pause)

What do you got to offer?
Tell me before we off ya, put you deep in the coffin
Been allergic to talkin', been a virgin to bullshit
And sell a dream in the auction, tell me just who your boss is
Niggas be fugazi, bitches be fugazi
This is for fugazi
Niggas and bitches who make habitual lyin' babies
Bless them little hearts
You can never persuade me
You can never relate me to him, to her, or that to them
Or you, the truth you love to bend
In the back, in the bed, on the floor, that's your ho
On the couch, in the mouth, I'll be out, really though
See, loud, rich niggas got low money
And loud, broke niggas got no money
The irony behind it is so funny
And I seen it all this past year
Pass on some advice we feel:

You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard


[{Kendrick Lamar} & Ronald Isley:]
Is this mic on? (Hey, move this way, this way)
Hey, hey! Hey! Turn the mic up, c'mon, c'mon
Is the mic on or not? I want the mic
We're bringing up nobody, nobody
Nobody but the number one rapper in the world
He done traveled all over the world
He came back just to give you some game
All of the little boys and girls, come up here

Come right here, this is for you, come on up

{Trial, tribulation, but I know God}
{The Devil wanna put me in a bow tie} (Make some noise, brother!)

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Pray that the holy water don't go dry
As I look around me
So many motherfuckers wanna down me
But enemigo never drown me
In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me

And (I love myself)
Huh, when you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
Ah, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
(I love myself)
Uh, illuminated by the hand of God, boy, don't seem shy
(I love myself)
One day at a time, huh

They wanna say it's a war outside, bomb in the street
Gun in the hood, mob of police
Rock on the corner with a line for the fiend
And a bottle full of lean and a model on the scheme, uh
These days of frustration keep y'all on tuck and rotation (Come to the front, yeah)
I duck these cold faces, post up fi-fie-fo-fum basis
Dreams of reality's peace (Oh, yeah)
Blow steam in the face of the beast
Sky could fall down, wind could cry now
Look at me motherfucker I smile-

And (I love myself)
Uh, and when you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
Ah, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
(I love myself)
Illuminated—
All ya'll come to the front, ya'll come up to the front
(I love myself)
Baby what about you? Come on

(Crazy, what you gon' do?)
Lift up your head and keep moving, (Keep moving) turn the mic up
(Haunt you)
Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart
On my sleeve, let the runway start
You know the miserable do love company
What do you want from me and my scars?
Everybody lack confidence, everybody lack confidence
How many times my potential was anonymous?
How many times the city making me promises?
So I promise this, nigga

(I love myself)
Uh, and when you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
Ah, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
(I love myself)
Huh, illuminated by the hand of God, boy don't seem shy
(I love myself)

Huh (Walk my bare feet) Huh (Walk my bare feet)
Huh (Down, down valley deep) Huh (Down, down valley deep)
(I love myself) Huh (Fi-fie-fo-fum) Huh (Fi-fie-fo-fum)
(I love myself) Huh (My heart undone) one, two, three

I went to war last night
With an automatic weapon, don't nobody call a medic
I'ma do it 'til I get it right (Oh no)
I went to war last night (Night, night, night, night)
I've been dealing with depression ever since an adolescent
Duckin' every other blessin', I can never see the message
I could never take the lead, I could never bob and weave
From a negative and letting them annihilate me
And it's evident I'm moving at a meteor speed
Finna run into a building, lay my body—

(Offstage Argument)
Not on my, not while I'm up here
Not on my time, kill the music, not on my time
We could save that shit for the streets
We could save that shit, this for the kids, bro
2015, niggas tired of playin' victim, dog
Niggas ain't trying to play vic— TuTu, how many niggas we done lost?
How many— Yan-Yan, how many we done lost?
No for real, answer the que—, how many niggas we done lost bro?
This—, this year alone
Exactly, so we— we ain't got time to waste time, my nigga
Niggas gotta make time, bro
The judge make time, you know that, the judge make time, right?
The judge make time so it ain't shit
It shouldn't be shit for us to come out here and appreciate the little bit of life we got left, dog
On the dead homies, Charlie P, you know that, bro
You know that
It's— it's mando, right, it's mando
And I s— I— And I— And I say this because I love you niggas, man
I love all my niggas, bro
Exac— enough said, enough said
And we gon' get back to the show and move on, because that shit petty, my nigga
Mic check, mic check, mic check, mic check, mic check
We gon' do some acappella shit before we get back to-
All my niggas listen, listen to this:

I promised Dave I'd never use the phrase "fuck nigga"
He said, "Think about what you saying." "Fuck niggas"
No better than Samuel on the Django
No better than a white man with slave boats"
Sound like I needed some soul searching
My Pops gave me some game in real person
Retraced my steps on what they never taught me
Did my homework fast before government caught me
So I'ma dedicate this one verse to Oprah
On how the infamous, sensitive N-word control us
So many artists gave her an explanation to hold us
Well, this is my explanation straight from Ethiopia
N-E-G-U-S definition: royalty; king royalty - wait listen
N-E-G-U-S description: black emperor, king, ruler, now let me finish
The history books overlook the word and hide it
America tried to make it to a house divided
The homies don't recognize we been using it wrong
So I'ma break it down and put my game in a song
N-E-G-U-S, say it with me, or say it no more
Black stars can come and get me
Take it from Oprah Winfrey, tell her she right on time
Kendrick Lamar, by far, realest Negus alive


[James Fauntleroy & Kendrick Lamar:]
Oh, oh, whoa
Uh, yeah
Uh, yeah
Uh
Yeah, uh

[Kendrick Lamar:]
The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propellin'
Let these words be your Earth and moon, you consume every message
As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
And with that being said, my nigga, let me ask this question:

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan—
(One two, one two, one two)
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propellin'
Let these words be your Earth and moon, you consume every message
As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
And with that being said, my nigga, let me ask this question:

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Won't you look to your left and right?
Make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

Do you believe in me? Are you deceiving me?
Could I let you down easily, is your heart where it need to be?
Is your smile on permanent? Is your vow on lifetime?
Would you know where the sermon is if I died in this next line?
If I'm tried in a court of law, if the industry cut me off
If the government want me dead, plant cocaine in my car
Would you judge me a drug-head or see me as K. Lamar?
Or question my character and degrade me on every blog?
Want you to love me like Nelson, want you to hug me like Nelson
I freed you from being a slave in your mind, you're very welcome
You tell me my song is more than a song, it's surely a blessing
But a prophet ain't a prophet 'til they ask you this question:

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Won't you look to your left and right?
Make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propellin'
Let my words be your Earth and moon, you consume every message
As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
And with that—

Do you believe in me? How much you believe in her?
You think she gon' stick around if them 25 years occur?
You think he can hold you down when you down behind bars, hurt?
You think y'all on common ground if you promise to be the first?
Can you be immortalized without your life being expired?
Even though you share the same blood, is it worth the time?
Like, who got your best interest?
Like, how much are you dependent?
How clutch are the people that say they love you?
And who pretending?
How tough is your skin when they turn you in?
Do you show forgiveness?
What brush do you bend when dusting your shoulders from being offended?
What kind of den did they put you in when the lions start hissing?
What kind of bridge did they burn?
Revenge on your mind when it's mentioned
You wanna love like Nelson, you wanna be like Nelson
You wanna walk in his shoes, but your peacemaking seldom
You wanna be remembered that delivered the message
That considered the blessing of everyone
This your lesson for everyone, say

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Won't you look to your left and right? Make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

The voice of Mandela, hope this flow stay propellin'
Let my word be your Earth and moon, you consume every message
As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
And if you riding with me, nigga—

I been wrote off before, I got abandonment issues
I hold grudges like bad judges, don't let me resent you
That's not Nelson-like—want you to love me like Nelson
I went to Robben's Island analysing; that's where his cell is
So I could find clarity—like, how much you cherish me?
Is this relationship a fake, or real as the heavens be?
See I got to question it all; family, friends, fans, cats, dogs
Trees, plants, grass, how the wind blow, Murphy's Law
Generation X—will I ever be your ex?
Flaws of a baby step', mauled by the mouth of Pit bulls
Put me under stress, crawled under rocks, duckin' y'all
It's respect—but then tomorrow, put my back against the wall
How many leaders you said you needed then left 'em for dead?
Is it Moses? Is it Huey Newton or Detroit Red?
Is it Martin Luther? JFK? Shooter—you assassin
Is it Jackie? Is it Jesse? Oh, I know it's Michael Jackson—oh

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
That nigga gave us "Billie Jean," you say he touched those kids?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propelling
Let my word be your Earth and moon, you consume every message
As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
And if you riding with me, nigga, let me ask this question, nigga

[Kendrick Lamar & 2Pac:]
"I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answers
Until I came home
But that didn't stop survivor's guilt
Going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was
But while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city
I was entering a new one
A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination
Made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned
The word was respect
Just because you wore a different gang color than mine's
Doesn't mean I can't respect you as a black man
Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets
If I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us
But I don't know, I'm no mortal man
Maybe I'm just another nigga"
Shit and that's all I wrote
I was gonna call it "Another Nigga" but, it ain't really a poem
I just felt like it's something you probably could relate to
Other than that, now that I finally got a chance to holler at you
I always wanted to ask you about a certain situa-
About a metaphor actually, uh, you spoke on the ground
What you mean by that, what the ground represent?

[2Pac (Kendrick Lamar):]
The ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil
(Right)
That's how I see it, my word is bond
I see—and the ground is the symbol for the poor people
(Right)
The poor people is gonna open up this whole world
And swallow up the rich people
'Cause the rich people gonna be so fat
And they gonna be so appetizing, you know what I'm saying wealthy, appetizing
The poor gonna be so poor, and hungry
(Right)
You know what I'm saying, it's gonna be like
You know what I'm saying, it's gonna be
There might, there might be some cannibalism out this muh-fu-
They might eat the rich, you know what I'm saying?

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Aight so let me ask you this then
Do you see yourself as somebody that's rich
Or somebody that made the best of their own opportunities?

[2Pac:]
I see myself as a natural born hustler
A true hustler in every sense of the word
I took nothin', I took the opportunities
I worked at the most menial and degrading job
And built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it
I went from having somebody managing me
To me hiring the person that works my management company
I changed everything, I realized my destiny
In a matter of five years, you know what I'm saying?
I made myself a millionaire, I made millions for a lot of people
Now it's time to make millions for myself, you know what I'm saying?
I made millions for the record companies
I made millions for these movie companies
Now I make millions for, for us

[Kendrick Lamar:]
And through your different avenues of success
How would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity?

[2Pac (Kendrick Lamar):]
By my faith in God, by my faith in the game
And by my faith in "All good things come to those that stay true"
(Right)
You know what I'm saying?
And it was happening to me for a reason
You know what I'm saying, I was noticing, shit
I was punching the right buttons and it was happening
So it's no problem, you know
I mean, it's a problem but I'm not finna let them know
I'm finna go straight through

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Would you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that
Somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall?

[2Pac:]
Shit, I like to think that at every opportunity I've ever been, uh
Threatened with resistance, it's been met with resistance
And not only me but, it goes down my family tree
You know what I'm saying, it's in my veins to fight back

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Aight well, how long will you think it take before niggas be like
"We fighting a war, I'm fighting a war I can't win
And I wanna lay it all down"

[2Pac:]
In this country, a black man only have like
5 years we can exhibit maximum strength
And that's right now while you a teenager, while you still strong
While you still wanna lift weights, while you still wanna shoot back
'Cause once you turn 30 it's like
They take the heart and soul out of a man
Out of a black man, in this country
And you don't wanna fight no more
And if you don't believe me, you can look around
You don't see no loud mouth 30-year old motherfuckers

[Kendrick Lamar:]
That's crazy, because me being one of your offsprings
Of the legacy you left behind, I can truly tell you that
There's nothing but turmoil goin' on so, I wanted to ask you
What you think is the future for me and my generation today?

[2Pac:]
I think that niggas is tired of grabbin' shit out the stores
And next time it's a riot it's gonna be like, uh, bloodshed
For real, I don't think America know that
I think America think we was just playing
And it's gonna be some more playing but
It ain't gonna be no playing
It's gonna be murder, you know what I'm saying?
It's gonna be like Nat Turner, 1831, up in this motherfucker
You know what I'm saying, it's gonna happen

[Kendrick Lamar:]
That's crazy, man, in my opinion
Only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations
Lot a people don't understand how important it is, you know
Sometimes I can like, get behind a mic
And I don't know what type of energy I'ma push out
Or where it comes from, trip me out sometimes

[2Pac (Kendrick Lamar):]
Because it's spirits, we ain't even really rappin'
We just letting our dead homies tell stories for us
(Damn)

[Kendrick Lamar:]
I wanted to read one last thing to you
It's actually something a good friend had wrote
Describing my world, it says:

[2Pac:]
"The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it
Its only job is to eat or consume everything around it
In order to protect itself from this mad city
While consuming its environment
The caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive
One thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him
But praises the butterfly
The butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness
And the beauty within the caterpillar
But having a harsh outlook on life
The caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak
And figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits
Already surrounded by this mad city
The caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon
Which institutionalizes him
He can no longer see past his own thoughts
He's trapped
When trapped inside these walls certain ideas take root, such as
Going home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city
The result?
Wings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant
Finally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations
That the caterpillar never considered, ending the internal struggle
Although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different
They are one and the same"
What's your perspective on that?

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Pac? Pac? Pac?!


[Bilal:]
Come here, girl
Oh, you want me to touch you right there?
Oh, like a little lamb, play in your hair
Oh you want it? Oh you want it right now
Like that? I got you baby
All on you baby
Push it back on daddy
Push it back on daddy, baby

[Kendrick Lamar:]
I seen it vividly, jogging my brain memory, life no—
I seen it vividly, jogging my brain memory
Life no longer infinity, this was the final calling
No birds chirping or flying, no dogs barking
We all nervous and crying, moving in caution
In disbeliefs our belief's the reason for all this
The tallest building plummet, cracking, and crumbling
The ground is shaking, swallowing young woman
With a baby, daisies, and other flowers burning in destruction
The smell is disgusting, the heat is unbearable
Preachers touching on boys run for cover, the paranoid
Rapists and murderers hurdle alleys
Valleys and high places turn into dust
Famous screaming in agony
Atheists for suicide, planes falling out the sky
Trains jumping off the track, mothers yelling "he's alive"
Backpedaling Christians settling for forgiveness
Evidence all around us the town is covered in fishes
Ocean water dried out, fire burning more tides out
Tabernacle and city capital turned inside out
Public bathroom, college classroom's been deserted
Another trumpet has sounded off and everyone heard it
(It's happening) no more running from world wars
(It's happening) no more discriminating the poor
(It's happening) no more bad bitches and real niggas
Wishing for green and gold the last taste of allure
I swore I seen it vividly
A moniker of war from heaven that play the symphony
Thunder like number four, then I heard
"What have you did for me"
I fell to my knees, pulled out my resume
That dated back to June 17th, 1987
My paperwork was like a receipt
I was valedictorian, I was fearful of judgment
But confident I had glory in all my past endeavors
Close my eyes, pray to God that I live forever
Dark skies, fire and brimstone, some of us sent home
Some of us never did wrong but still went to hell
Geez Louise, I thought you said that I excel
I made To Pimp a Butterfly for you
Told me to use my vocals to save mankind for you
Say I didn't try for you, say I didn't ride for you
I tithed for you, I pushed the club to the side for you
Who love you like I love you?
Crucifix, tell me you can fix
Anytime I need, I'ma start jotting everything in my diary
Never would you lie to me
Always camaraderie, I can see, our days been numbered
Revelation greatest as we hearing the last trumpet
All man, child, woman, life completely went in reverse
I guess I'm running in place trying to make it to church

Young nigga act an ass
Young nigga act a fool
Young nigga get yo' cash
Young nigga do what it do
Young nigga go, young nigga go
Young nigga go, young nigga go
Whatever makes all of you happy in this bitch
Just take it all back before the light switch


Pimp-pimp (Hooray)
Pimp-pimp (Hooray)
(Hooray)
Pimp-pimp (Hooray)
Pimp-pimp

I'm sick and tired of being tired
Can't pick a side, the Gemini
Prophesies if we live or not
Promise mamma not to fear nobody
Seen black turn 'em Burgundy
Hundred of them, I know I'm greedy
Stuck inside the belly of the beast
Can you please pray for me?

Get God on the phone, said it won't be long
I see jigaboos, I see Styrofoams
My hood going brazy, where did we go wrong?
I see jigaboos, I see Styrofoams
Get Top on the phone, tell the squad come home
We gon' ball again 'fore he call us home
World is going brazy, where did we go wrong?
It's a tidal wave, it's a thunder dome
Get God on the phone
I just got a raise (I just got a raise)
Spent it all on me (I spent it all on me)
Diamonds all appraised (Diamonds all appraised)
And I'm bossing up (And I'm bossing up)
Bitch, get out the way (Bitch, get out the way)
I'm the only way, we can fornicate
Ah, pimping and posing, look what I drove in, ah
Having these hoes and I know that I'm chosen, ah
I live by the code and me and my bros and, ah
My dollars ain't foldin', you was never the homie

Seen black turn 'em Burgundy
Hundred of them, I know I'm greedy
Stuck inside the belly of the beast
Can you please pray for me?

Get God on the phone
Said it won't be long
I see jigaboos, I see Styrofoams
My hood going brazy
Where did we go wrong?
I see jigaboos, I see Styrofoams
Get Top on the phone
(What's up, my nigga?)

Cornrow Kenny, he was born with a vision
All morning with the mixed dashboards, triple digits
Parallel park like an alien came visit
Slideshow for the night show, ten bitches
Find hoes with a blindfold, King Kendrick
(Hello, Billy)
So many plays, homie, I finesse
Palisade views with some sex
I lost a lot of love for missionary
This the first time I confess
Me and Top is like a Kobe and Phil
A father figure fuck with him, you get killed
Fuck with me and he will kill you himself
TDE the mafia of the west
Move in silence, yeah, we juggin' like that
Act of violence, yeah, we juggin' like that
I did a lot of dumb shit in my past
Lord forgive me, hoping I don't relapse
Dave just bought a new "nine eleven"
Almost thought I'd seen another plane crash
Q just bought a brand new McLaren
Rock-a-lack about to buy the projects
Moosa got his son dripping in gold
Ali 'bout to let his hair down on hoes
Me, I'm 'bout to let my hair down on hoes
Top billin', that's a million a show
Might blow the whole no whammy on Soul
Might tell Obama be more like Punch
Sounwave caught a Grammy last year
Mack wop, bet he do what he want
Fuck you niggas, level two, I'm not done
2Teez told me that I'm the one
I can put a rapper on life support
Guarantee that's something none of you want
Ten homies down and they all serving life
What is like twenty-five hundred a month?
What if I empty my bank out and stunt?
What if I certified all of these ones?
Bitch, I get buck, I'm as real as they come
Shit is amazing, I'm feeding my cravings
You know that you want me, come here now, lil' baby
I'm fucking, I'm crazy
Serving it like I belong in the basement
Or live at the Days Inn
Yan Yan my relative, black cherry soda
Pistol and poverty, come get to know us
(Get Top on the phone)

Who doing the drums?
Man put that nigga on the drums man
Yep, all day, "Mortal Man" and "Kunta"
Alright, from the top


[Kendrick Lamar:]
So I met this young lady, ya know, when I went back home. I was tryna spit my best game to her, you know, give her my best cap, but she kept on snapping her fingers like. I said "You know what, girl? You crazy." Then she asked me what he said

[Kendrick Lamar (Mani Strings):]
(What did the Asian say?)
"A peace of mind"
That's what the Asian said—I need a divine
Intervention was his religion and I was surprised
Him believing in Buddha, me believing in God
Asked him what are you doing, he said "taking my time"
Meditation is a must, it don't hurt if you try
See you thinking too much, plus you too full of yourself
Worried about your career, you ever think of your health?

(What did the Indian say?)
"A piece of land"
That's what the Indian said—I needed the man
Telling me longevity is in the dirt
Should buy some property first
Should profit a better dollar with generational perks
Equity at his best, really, you should invest
These tangible things expire, don't you expect
Income with so much outcome and yes
Look at my heritage, we blessed

(Now, what the black man say?)
"A piece of pussy"
That's what the black man said I needed to push me
To the limit, to satisfy my hunger
We do it all for a woman from haircut to a war
We like to live in the jungle, like to play in the peach
What you saying to me?
He said "nigga, come back to reality for a week"
Pussy is power, fuck on a new bitch every night
I wouldn't be prouder, you should allow it

(What the white man say?)
A piece of mine's
That's what the white man wanted when I rhyme
Telling me that he selling me just for $10.99
If I go platinum from rapping, I do the company fine
What if I compromise? He said it don't even matter
You make a million or more, you living better than average
You losing your core following, gaining it all
He put a price on my talent, I hit the bank and withdraw
Hit the bank and withdraw, hit the bank and withdraw
Put myself in the rocket ship and I shot for the stars
"Look at what you accomplishing"; what he said to the boy
"I'ma make you some promises that you just can't ignore
Your profession anonymous as an artist if I don't target your market
If you ain't signing your signature when I throw you my wallet
A lot of rappers are giving their demo all in the toilet
Your world tour, your master's, mortgage, I need a piece"

[Bilal:]
I holler, "What you do? What you say?"
I shall enjoy the fruits of my labor if I get freed today
I holler, "What you do? What you say?"
I shall enjoy the fruits of my labor if I get freed today

What the black man say?
Tell 'em we don't die, tell 'em we don't die
Tell 'em we don't die, we multiply
Tell 'em we don't die, tell 'em we don't die
Tell 'em we don't die, we multiply
Tell 'em we don't die, tell 'em we don't die
Tell 'em we don't die, we multiply
Tell 'em we don't die, tell 'em we don't die
Tell 'em we don't die, we multiply


[SZA (Kendrick Lamar):]
They say the government mislead the youth, youth, youth, youth
(Tell 'em when you went to the park and everybody came back and...)
And welfare don't mean well for you, you, you, you
(What about when you tried to do a side for that but you...)
They tell me that my bill's past due, due, due, due
(Talk about the charge you got...)
And preacher man don't always tell the truth, truth, truth, truth
(Do you believe in God? If you don't, it's cool)

[SZA (Kendrick Lamar):]
(But) head is the answer, head is the future
Don't second guess yourself
(Don't tell them when you second guess yourself I need you in the kitchen now I forgot...)
Come on give me some help, hey
Head is the answer, do it for the future, girl

[Lance Skiiiwalker & SZA:]
Don't second guess yourself
Come on, give me some help

[Lance Skiiiwalker:]
And I just wanna
And I just wanna
Straight up
Eyes with my head
And I can't use some help
Straight up

[SZA:]
Head is the future


[Anna Wise:]
Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor
Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal
Drowned inside the lake outside, away you flow
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor
Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal
Drowned inside the lake outside, away you flow
And this I know

I got 100 on my dash, got 200 in my drum
Name in the grab bags, put my Bible in the trunk
Taaka vodka on the top of my binocular, I'm drunk
How come I can make them popular, pop em' when I want
See I'm livin' with anxiety, duckin' the sobriety
Fuckin' up the system, I ain't fuckin' with society
Justice ain't free, therefore justice ain't me
So I justify his name on obituary
Why you wanna see a good man with a broken heart?
Once upon a time I used to go to church and talk to God
Now I'm thinkin' to myself, hollow tips is all I got
Now I'm drinkin' by myself, at the intersection, parked
Watch you when you walk inside your house
You threw your briefcase all on the couch
I plan on creeping through your fuckin' door and blowin' out
Every piece of your brain until your son jump in your arms
Cut on the engine, then sped off in the rain, I'm gone

[Anna Wise:]
Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor
Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal
Drowned inside the lake outside, away you flow
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me

[Punch (Kendrick Lamar):]
(He drove alone, with a bottle of his own grippin' the handle)
Lit off Henny, I'm tryna dismantle
These wicked ways, I've engaged in such a gamble
'Cause I could speak the truth and I know the world would unravel, wait
That's a bit ambitious maybe I'm trippin'
Maybe I'm crazy, maybe I exist in a different dimension
Not to mention when I close my eyes I see the distance
It's such a scary sight so I rarely go to sleep at night
I watch the sun rise then I watch the sun fall
Studied the son of God and still don't recognize my flaws
I guess I'm lost, the cost of being successful is equal to being neglectful
I pray my experience helps you
As for me I'm tryna sort it out
Searching for loopholes in my bruised soul
But who knows?
I just need a little space to breathe
I know perception is key, so I am king

[Kendrick Lamar (Jay Rock):]
The other side has never mortified my mortal mind
The borderline between insanity is Father Time
I fall behind my skeleton, they tell me that I'm blind
I know that I'm intelligent, my confidence just died
(Carpe diem, seize the day, I can't compromise)
(A tapeworm couldn't cure this gluttonous appetite)
(A couple trinkets, they seein' me as I pacify)
(But couldn't fathom the meaning of seein' sacrifice)
I'm passin' lives on the daily, maybe I'm losing faith
Genocism and capitalism just made me hate
Correctionals and these private prisons gave me a date
Professional dream killers reason why I'm awake
(I'm sleepwalkin', I'm street stalkin', I'm outta place)
(Reinforcing this heat barking, these are the brakes)
(Before I blink, do I see me before them pearly gates?)
(Or this is just a mirage or a facade)
Wait


[Kendrick Lamar:]
These metamorphic supernatural forces dominate what I see
A Gemini, duality personalities always conflicted me

[Kendrick Lamar (CeeLo Green):]
Oh! But don't be scared of me, girl
(I can explain)
I know it's foreign to you
I know it's hard to believe
God give me the favor
(Let me explain)
More than a compliment
And I could use some assistance, let me show you how
(I can explain)
Oh shando! I spin around two times
I'll be there with the answer
(Let me explain)

[CeeLo Green:]
I'm bizarre, avant-garde
Both sides of me are evenly odd
It's attractive, you're intrigued
Am I mortal man or make-believe?
Anything you want to know
(I can explain)
I can explain it
Any misunderstandings, baby (Let me explain)
I can explain it
Why don't you sit and talk to me a while? (I can explain)
Let me explain it, ah yes (Let me explain)

[Kendrick Lamar:]
My mama told me that I was different the moment I was invented
Estranged baby, no I'm not ashamed
I recommend every inch of your lunatic ways
Praise the lord, you teach the kids how to be themselves and plenty more
You know the male species can be redundant
I mean we love a woman and think we can satisfy her
Between sheets, covers and pillows
I'm promising your lack of tolerance stuck on a zero
I'm promising that I'm acknowledging you as my hero
'Cause you believe in me
No you're not easily impressed
But I possess qualities that you need to see
Look at my flaws, look at my flaws
Look at my imperfections in awe
Look how you unique that my mystique is a round of applause
And yours equally valued
You stick out like an alien compared to those around you
And that's alright because I like it
You and me are the same
Hopefully I'm invited, hopefully you don't change
Because I know for sure who you are

[Kendrick Lamar (CeeLo Green):]
(I can explain)
Your mama raised you, your daddy raised you
Hand-washing your clothes on Sunday
(Let me explain)
Walking your brother to school, three miles away
To feed the mind and soul
(I can explain)
Don't you explain that, don't you explain the reason why your mind, it travels
(Let me explain)
I wanna know what you think
I wanna pick your brain when I see you
But don't you ever
(Let me explain)
Oh shando! I spin around two times
A blessing in disguise
(I can explain)
I know for sure who you are
You're the goddess of the odd
I am yours
(I can explain)

[Kendrick Lamar:]
I am yours
I am yours
I am yours
I am yours

[Egypt:]
Compton is where I'm from
Is where I'm from, where is I'm from

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Yeah, yeah
Young Egypt
Look, look

I feel like Pacino in Godfather, I'm charged
Our Father who art in Heaven, Kendrick at large
Came in the game with a plan of beatin' the odds
What an accomplishment, broken promises
Kept my focus anonymous 'til I dealt with the consequence
The greatest, the latest mogul, you know what time it is
You niggas fear me like y'all fear God
You sound frantic, I hear panic in your voice
Just know the mechanics of making your choice in writin' your bars
Before you poke out your chest, loosen your bra
Before you step out of line and dance with the star
I could never end a career if it never start
The murderous capital, avenues lookin' like evil dead zombies
With batteries to the head
The flattery of watchin' my stock rise
The salary, the compensation tripled my cock size
I run through these stop signs with no brake fluid
Just premium gas, do it for dolo
Crash markets and prejudiced tags, look at my photo
Black excellence, pessimist, die countin' my coin
Hope it's evident that I inspired a thousand emcees to do better
I blew cheddar on youth centers, buildings and beamers and blue leather
Forecastin' my future, this is the future
The mastermind, until my next album, more power to you

[Part III]

[Kendrick Lamar & Taz Arnold:]
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on (Hell yeah), come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on

This is a fifteen minute song (Aha ha ha)
We're just jammin' out, we on stage
Taz, we just jammin' out (Shh)
Hundred thousand (Aw, yeah, aw, shit, ha ha ha ha)
Hundred thousand, you gotta see it!
Look, look, look, go back to the down note
They all sing this shit, everybody

Now I don't let you down, down for
You see, you see, you see, you see (Right)
But I don't shake you down, dog for you, you, you, you, uh
They say the government ain't the truth, truth, (Mhm) truth, truth
And the politicians always mislead the youth, youth, youth, youth

But head is the answer
Head is the future
Don't second guess yourself
Come on, give me some help
Hey one more time, band, I need y'all to help me out right now (ha ha ha ha)
Head is the answer (Yeah)
Head is the futu—it's the future, that nigga said
Don't second guess yourself (Crazy, holy shit, ha ha ha)
Come on, give me some help
Say come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on—my background singer—come on, come on (Right, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Say, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on

I said, girl, you make me wanna, uh
Great, the—the ho's screaming now, uh (ha ha ha ha)

Ju—you just make me wanna drag you down
To—down, around like bam, bam, bam, bam, bam
And, baby, if your mama's around if your mama's around
If your mama's around if your mama's around
Tell her, tell her
No discrimination (ha ha), she young nigga chasin' (Aha hah!)
And she can get this dick too!

[Kendrick Lamar:]
I said come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Yeah, nigga
You gotta do it, man
We gonna lay that shit
We gonna lay that shit man and watch what it's gon' do


Why so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I'm down on my luck
And it's something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it's breaking me down honey

Two tears in the bucket I cry with you, uh
But I could never lie with you
I could never afford not to afford
I could never put my plans to the side with you
I could never see a red light
Like a deer with a headlight
I freeze up when I re-up
See I barely have patience
And you're relating
Only the moment to complete us
Why you hate to work for it?
The reason I never went to work for it
See a nine to five was so jive turkey
But when Thanksgiving came that check didn't hurt me
You plead the fifth
I read the Fifth Amendment
We both criminals with bad intentions
They say time heals all
But if I can shortcut
My success, Corvettes by tomorrow
Wait a minute!

Now, why you so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I'm down on my luck
And it's something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it's breaking me down honey

My home girl got a credit card scam
She got a scholarship to college but she don't give a damn
Intuition got a broke bitch wishin'
She tell me this on the phone with the noodles in the pan
I know you, woman, I console you, woman
You feel like the universe owes you, woman
Oh the anticipation, of hoping you could make it
Bitches don't prosper chasing education
But you're talented, and can't handle it
And your homegirls can't be your manager
365 times four, plus more
If you can't get it right, tell me, do you got the stamina?
But shit, ain't no money like fast money
Even today I'm considered a crash dummy
A rapper chasing stardom, how can I fast forward?
My accolades better than all them

Why you so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I'm down on my luck
And it's something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it's breaking me down honey

I wrote this song looking at a broke home baby (broke home baby)
You know the poverty stricken the little broke born babies (broke born babies)
Somebody yell "Kendrick American, they sho' is crazy"
And I said, "Why?"
Then he looked me in the eye, and said "Nigga, you fucked up"
You're banking on good luck, you wishing for miracles
You never been through shit, you're crying hysterical
You settle for everything, complain about everything
You say you sold crack, my world amphetamine
Your projects ain't shit, I live in a hut bitch
I'm living to keep warm, you living to pay rent
I prayed my way through by waiting on Allah
You played your way through, by living in sci-fi
Bullshitting yourself, you talking to strangers
Same thing goes for the ones you came with
When y'all came on the boat looking for hope
And all you can say is that you're looking for dope
These days ain't no compromise
And your pain ain't mines half the time
A brand new excuse ain't shit to me
Bitch, I made my moves, with shackled feet
Cape Town

In today's day and age we practice the self pity of taking the easy way out
You wait on them, him and her
But when a blessing takes too long, that's when you go wrong
You selfish motherfucker

Why so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I'm down on my luck
And it's something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it's breaking me down honey

Pimp pimp (hooray!)


[Bēkon:]
Is it wickedness?
Is it weakness?
You decide
Are we gonna live or die?

[Kendrick Lamar:]
So I was takin' a walk the other day, and I seen a woman-a blind woman-pacin' up and down the sidewalk. She seemed to be a bit frustrated, as if she had dropped somethin' and havin' a hard time findin' it. So after watchin' her struggle for a while, I decide to go over and lend a helping hand, you know? "Hello, ma'am, can I be of any assistance? It seems to me that you have lost something. I would like to help you find it." She replied: "Oh yes, you have lost something. You've lost... your life."

[Bēkon:]
Is it wickedness?

[Eric Bolling & Kimberly Guilfoyle:]
Lamar stated his views on police brutality with that line in the song, quote: "And we hate the popo, wanna kill us in the street fo' sho'..."
Oh please, ugh, I don't like it.


I got, I got, I got, I got
Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
Cocaine quarter piece, got war and peace inside my DNA
I got power, poison, pain and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle though, ambition, flow, inside my DNA
I was born like this, since one like this
Immaculate conception
I transform like this, perform like this
Was Yeshua's new weapon
I don't contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head
This that put-the-kids-to-bed
This that I got, I got, I got, I got
Realness, I just kill shit 'cause it's in my DNA
I got millions, I got riches buildin' in my DNA
I got dark, I got evil, that rot inside my DNA
I got off, I got troublesome, heart inside my DNA
I just win again, then win again like Wimbledon, I serve
Yeah, that's him again, the sound that engine in is like a bird
You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard
I know how you work, I know just who you are
See, you's a, you's a, you's a-
Bitch, your hormones probably switch inside your DNA
Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA
Daddy probably snitched, heritage inside your DNA
Backbone don't exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge
See, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front
Shit I've been through probably offend you
This is Paula's oldest son
I know murder, conviction
Burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead, redemption
Scholars, fathers dead with kids
And I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier's DNA (I'm a soldier's DNA)
Born inside the beast
My expertise checked out in second grade
When I was 9, on-cell motel, we didn't have nowhere to stay
At 29, I've done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I'm supposed to
Antisocial, extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And Nazareth gonna plead his case
The reason my power's here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet say

I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
This is why I say that hip-hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice, fuck your life
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a better, fuck your life
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
This is my heritage, all I'm inheritin'
Money and power, the mecca of marriages

Tell me somethin'
You motherfuckers can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you're in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy and walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows, I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder-these are the breaks
These are the times, level number 9
Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate
Sex, money, murder-our DNA

[Video outro:]
DNA
Gimme some ganja, gimme some ganja

Gimme some ganja
Real nigga in my DNA
Ain't no ho inside my DNA
Drippin' gold inside my DNA

Ain't no ho inside my DNA


[Kid Capri:]
New shit, new Kung Fu Kenny

[Kendrick Lamar:]
I got so many theories and suspicions
I'm diagnosed with real nigga conditions
Today is the day I follow my intuition
Keep the family close-get money, fuck bitches
I double-parked the Aston in the red
My mama told me that I'ma work myself to death
My girl told me don't let these hoes get in my head
My world been ecstatic, I checked the signal that read-

Buzzin', radars is buzzin'
Yah, yah, yah, yah
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah
Buzzin', radars is buzzin'
Yah, yah, yah, yah
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah

Interviews wanna know my thoughts and opinions
Fox News wanna use my name for percentage
My latest muse is my niece, she worth livin'
See me on the TV and scream, "That's Uncle Kendrick!"
Yeah, that's the business (Uno)
Somebody tell Geraldo this nigga got some ambition
I'm not a politician, I'm not 'bout a religion
I'm a Israelite, don't call me black no more
That word is only a color, it ain't facts no mo'
My cousin called, my cousin Carl Duckworth
Said know my worth
And Deuteronomy say that we all been cursed

[Kid Capri:]
New Kung Fu Kenny
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Y'all know what happens on Earth stays on Earth
Here we go

[Kendrick Lamar:]
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't give a, I don't give a, I don't give a fuck

I'm willin' to die for this shit
I done cried for this shit, might take a life for this shit
Put the Bible down and go eye for an eye for this shit
D.O.T. my enemy, won't catch a vibe for this shit, ayy
I been stomped out in front of my mama
My daddy commissary made it to commas
Bitch, all my grandmas dead
So ain't nobody prayin' for me, I'm on your head, ayy
Thirty millions later, know the feds watchin'
Auntie on my Telegram like, "Be cautious!"
I be hangin' out at Tam's, I be on Stockton
I don't do it for the 'Gram, I do it for Compton
I'm willin' to die for this shit, nigga
I'll take your fuckin' life for this shit, nigga
We ain't goin' back to broke, family sellin' dope
That's why you maney-ass rap niggas better know

If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'mma make it look sexy
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'mma make it look sexy
I pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy
They won't take me out my element
Nah, take me out my element

I'm allergic to a bitch nigga, ayy
An imaginary rich nigga, ayy
Seven figures, ho, that's slimmer than my bitch figure, ayy
Goin' digital and physical on all y'all, ayy
Bunch of criminals and money in my phone calls, ayy
We okay, we let the A1 fly
Relocate, jump on the same G5
Checkin' for me heavy 'cause I go, yeah, I go, yeah
They never been ready, yeah, I know, yeah, I know, yeah
100K spread 'cross the floor, 'cross the floor yeah
None of y'all fuckin' with the flow yeah, the flow yeah
Years in the makin' and don't y'all mistake it
I got 'em by a landslide, we talkin' 'bout races
You know this'll never be a tie, just look at their laces
You know careers take off, just gotta be patient
Mister One-Through-Five that's the only logic
Fake my death, go to Cuba, that's the only option

If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'mma make it look sexy
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'mma make it look sexy
I pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy
They won't take me out my element
Nah, take me out my element

Damned if I do, if I don't, ya
Goddamn us all if you won't, ya
Damn, damn, damn, it's a goddamn shame
You ain't front in line, get out the goddamn way

Niggas thought they weren't gonna see me, huh?
Niggas thought that K-Dot real life was the same life they see on TV, huh?
Niggas wanna flex on me and be in LA for free, huh?
Next time they hit the 10 freeway, we need a receipt, huh?
'Cause most of y'all ain't real
Most of y'all gon' squeal
Most of y'all just envy, but jealousy get you killed
Most of y'all throw rocks and try to hide your hand
Just say his name and I promise that you'll see Candyman
Because it's all in your eyes
Most of y'all tell lies
Most of y'all don't fade
Most of y'all been advised
Last LP I tried to lift the black artists
But it's a difference 'tween black artists and wack artists

[Kendrick Lamar:]
If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'mma make it look sexy

[Kid Capri:]
It's the one and only, the world's greatest, the Kid Capri

If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'mma make it look sexy

They won't take me out my element
Nah, take me out my element


[Kendrick Lamar (Chelsea Blythe):]
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
(Ain't nobody prayin' for me)
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
(Nobody prayin' for me)
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
(Ain't nobody prayin' for me)
(Nobody prayin' for me)

[Kendrick Lamar:]
I feel like a chip on my shoulders
I feel like I'm losin' my focus
I feel like I'm losin' my patience
I feel like my thoughts in the basement
Feel like, I feel like you're miseducated
Feel like I don't wanna be bothered
I feel like you may be the problem
I feel like it ain't no tomorrow, fuck the world
The world is endin', I'm done pretendin'
And fuck you if you get offended
I feel like friends been overrated
I feel like the family been fakin'
I feel like the feelings are changin'
Feel like my thought of compromise is jaded
Feel like you wanna scrutinize how I made it
Feel like I ain't feelin' you all
Feel like removin' myself, no feelings involved
I feel for you, I've been in the field for you
It's real for you, right? Shit, I feel like-

Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin'

I feel niggas been out of pocket
I feel niggas tappin' their pockets
I feel like debating on who the greatest can stop it
I am legend, I feel like all of y'all is peasants
I feel like all of y'all is desperate
I feel like all it take is a second to feel like
Mike Jordan whenever holdin' a real mic
I ain't feelin' your presence
Feel like I'mma learn you a lesson
Feel like only me and the music, though
I feel like your feelin' ain't mutual
I feel like the enemy you should know
Feel like the feelin' of no hope
The feelin' of bad dope
A quarter ounce manipulated from soap
The feelin', the feelin' of false freedom
I'll force-feed 'em the poison that fill 'em up in the prison
I feel like it's just me
Look, I feel like I can't breathe
Look, I feel like I can't sleep
Look, I feel heartless, often off this
Feelin' of fallin', of fallin' apart with
Darkest hours, lost it
Fillin' the void of bein' employed with ballin'
Streets is talkin', fill in the blanks with coffins
Fill up the banks with dollars
Fill up the graves with fathers
Fill up the babies with bullshit
Internet blogs and pulpit, fill 'em with gossip
I feel like this gotta be the feelin' where 'Pac was
The feelin' of an apocalypse happenin'
But nothin' is awkward, the feelin' won't prosper
The feelin' is toxic, I feel like I'm boxin' demons
Monsters, false prophets schemin'
Sponsors, industry promises
Niggas, bitches, honkies, crackers, Compton
Church, religion, token blacks in bondage
Lawsuit visits, subpoena served in concert
Fuck your feelings, I mean this for imposters
I can feel it, the phoenix sure to watch us
I can feel it, the dream is more than process
I can put a regime that forms a Loch Ness
I can feel it, the scream that haunts all logic
I feel like saying somethin', I feel like taking somethin'
I feel like skatin' off, I feel like waitin' for 'em
Maybe it's too late for 'em
I feel like the whole world want me to pray for 'em
But who the fuck prayin' for me?

Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Who prayin' for me?
Ain't nobody prayin'


[DJ Dahi (Kendrick Lamar):]
I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up (fired, fire)
All I want tonight is just to get high up (high, high, high)
Girl, you look so good, it's to die for (die for fire)
Ooh, that pussy good, it's to die for (I'm on fire)

[Kendrick Lamar & Rihanna:]
It's a secret society
All we ask is trust
(All we ask is trust)
All we got is us
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Kung Fu Kenny now
My resume is real enough for two millenniums
A better way to make a wave, stop defendin' them
I meditate and moderate all of my wins again
I'm hangin' on the fence again
I'm always on your mind
I put my lyric and my lifeline on the line
And ain't no limit when I might shine, might grind
You rollin' with it at the right time, right now
(Only for the dollar sign)

[Rihanna:]
Bad girl RiRi now
Swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve, leave it now
On your pulse like it's EDM
Gas in the bitch like it's premium
Haul ass on a bitch all in the fast lane
Been a bad bitch way before any cash came
I'm established
Hundred carats on my name
Run the atlas, I'm a natural, I'm alright

[Kendrick Lamar (Rihanna):]
I'm a savage, I'm a asshole, I'm a king
Shimmy-yeah, shimmy-yeah, shimmy-yeah, rock (yeah)
You can tell your nigga he can meet me outside (yeah)
You can babysit him when I leave him outside
Ain't no other love like the one I know
I done been down so long lost hope
I done came down so hard I slowed
Honesty forever, all a real nigga want

[DJ Dahi (Kendrick Lamar):]
I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up (fired, fire)
All I want tonight is just to get high up (yeah)

[Kendrick Lamar:]
All I want is, all I want is

[Kendrick Lamar (Rihanna):]
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
(10-4, no switchin' sides)
Feel somethin' wrong
(You actin' shifty, you don't vibe)
With me no more, I need
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Tell me who you loyal to
Is it money? Is it fame? Is it weed? Is it drink?
Is it comin' down with the loud pipes in the rain?
Big chillin', only for the power in your name
Tell me who you loyal to
Is it love for the streets when the lights get dark?
Is it unconditional when the 'Rari don't start?
Tell me when your loyalty is comin' from the heart

[Rihanna & Kendrick Lamar:]
Tell me who you loyal to
Do it start with your woman or your man? (Mmm)
Do it end with your family and friends? (Mmm)
Or you're loyal to yourself in advance?
I said, tell me who you loyal to
Is it anybody that you would lie for?
Anybody you would slide for?
Anybody you would die for?

[Kendrick Lamar:]
That's what God for

[DJ Dahi (Kendrick Lamar):]
I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up (fired, fire)

Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty

It's so hard to be humble
It's so hard to be
Lord knows I'm tryin'

Lord knows I'm dyin', baby

Love's gonna get you killed
But pride's gonna be the death of you and you and me
And you and you and you and me

[Steve Lacy (Kendrick Lamar):]
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
(In another life, I surely was there)
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
(I care, I care)

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Hell-raising, wheel-chasing, new worldly possessions
Flesh-making, spirit-breaking, which one would you lessen?
The better part, the human heart
You love 'em or dissect 'em
Happiness or flashiness? How do you serve the question?
See, in a perfect world, I would be perfect, world
I don't trust people enough beyond their surface, world
I don't love people enough to put my faith in man
I put my faith in these lyrics, hoping I make a band
I understand I ain't perfect
I probably won't come around
This time, I might put you down
Last time, I ain't give a fuck, I still feel the same now
My feelings might go numb, you're dealing with cold thumb
I'm willing to give up a leg and arm to show empathy from
Pity parties and functions of you and yours
A perfect world, you probably live another 24
I can't fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure
I can't fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure

[Steve Lacy (Kendrick Lamar):]
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
In another life, I surely was there
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
(I care, I care)

[Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise:]
Maybe I wasn't there (We saw you first)
Maybe I wasn't there (I saw you first)
Maybe I wasn't there (I saw you first)
Maybe I wasn't there

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Now, in a perfect world, I probably won't be insensitive
Cold as December, but never remember what winter did
I wouldn't blame you for mistakes I made or the bed I laid
Seems like I point the finger just to make a point nowadays
Smiles and cold stares, the temperature goes there
Indigenous disposition, feel like we belong here
I know the walls, they can listen, I wish they could talk back
The hurt becomes repetition, the love almost lost that
Sick venom in men and women overcome with pride
A perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies
Promises are broken and more resentment come alive
Race barriers make inferior of you and I
See, in a perfect world, I'll choose faith over riches
I'll choose work over bitches, I'll make schools out of prison
I'll take all the religions and put 'em all in one service
Just to tell 'em we ain't shit, but He's been perfect, world

[Steve Lacy (Kendrick Lamar):]
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
(In another life, I surely was there)
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
(I care, I care)

[Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise:]
Maybe I wasn't there (We saw you first)
Maybe I wasn't there (I saw you first)
Maybe I wasn't there (I saw you first)
Maybe I wasn't there


[Music video version:] Wicked or weakness, you gotta see this, way (yeah, yeah!)
[Regular version:] Nobody pray for me, it been that day for me, way (yeah, yeah!)

Aye, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits
But now I'm counting this
Parmesan where my accountant lives in fact I'm downing this
D'usśe with my boo bae, tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy your ass the world with my paystub
Ooh that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down we playing Tetris
A.M. to the P.M., P.M. to the A.M. funk
Piss out your per diem you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
It's levels to it, you and I know, bitch be humble

(Hol' up bitch) sit down,
(Hol' up lil bitch, hol' up, lil bitch) be humble

Get the fuck off my stage, I'm the sandman (sandman)
Get the fuck off my dick, that ain't right
I make a play fucking up your whole life
I'm so fucking sick and tired of the Photoshop
Show me something natural like afro on Richard Pryor
Show me something natural like ass with some stretch marks
Still I take you down right on your mamma's couch in polo socks, aye
This shit way too crazy, aye
You do not amaze me, aye
I blew cool from AC, aye
Obama just paged me, aye
I don't fabricate it, aye
Most of ya'll be faking, aye

[Kendrick Lamar:]
I need some water
Somethin' came over me
Way too hot to simmer down
Might as well overheat
Too close to comfort
As blood rush my favorite vein
Heartbeat racin' like a junkie's
I just need you to want me
Am I askin' too much?
Let me put the head in
Ooh, I don't want more than that
Girl, I respect the cat
I promise just a touch
Let me put the head in
If it's okay
She said, "It's okay."

Wake up in the mornin'

Go hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch, don't go to work today
Cop you a fit or maybe some kicks and make it work today
Hang with the homies, stunt on your baby mama
Sip some lean, go get a pistol, shoot out the window
Bet your favorite team, play you some Madden
Go to the club or your mama house
Whatever you doin', just make it count
(I need some water)
Wake up in the mornin'
Thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Hop in the shower, put on your makeup, lace your weave up
Touch on yourself, call up your nigga, tell him he ain't shit
Credit card scam, get you a Visa, make it pay your rent
Hop on the 'Gram, flex on the bitches that be hatin' on you
Pop you a pill, call up your bitches, have 'em waitin' on you
Go to the club, have you some fun, make that ass bounce
It's whatever, just make it count

She said, "It's okay."

I wake in the mornin', my head spinnin' from the last night
Both in a trance, feelings are dead-what a fast life!
Manager called, the lobby call is 11:30
Did this before, promised myself I'd be a hour early
Room full of clothes, bag full of money: call it loose change
Fumbled my jewelry, 100K, I lost a new chain
Hop on the bird, hit the next city for another M
Take me a nap then do it again
We all woke up, tryna tune to the daily news
Lookin' for confirmation, hopin' election wasn't true
All of us worried, all of us buried in our feelings deep
None of us married to his proposal, make us feel cheap
Stale and sad, distraught and mad, tell the neighbor 'bout it
Bet they agree, parade the streets with your voice proudly
Time passin', things change
Revertin' back to our daily programs, stuck in our ways; Lust

Lately, I feel like I been lustin' over the fame
Lately, we lust on the same routine of shame
Lately, lately, lately, my lust been heightened (Lately)
Lately, it's all contradiction
Lately, I'm not here
Lately, I lust over self
Lust turn into fear
Lately, in James 4: 4 says
Friend of the world is enemy of the Lord
Brace yourself, lust is all yours

I need some water
Somethin' came over me
Way too hot to simmer down
Might as well overheat
Too close to comfort
As blood rush my favorite vein
Heartbeat racin' like a junkie's
I just need you to want me
Am I askin' too much?
Let me put the head in
Ooh, I don't want more than that
Girl, I respect the cat
I promise just a touch
Let me put the head in
If it's okay
She said, "It's okay."

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Throw a steak off the ark
To a pool full of sharks, he'll take it
Leave him in the wilderness
With a sworn nemesis, he'll make it, he'll make it
Take the gratitude from him
I bet he'll show you somethin', whoa, whoa
I chip a nigga little bit of nothin'
I chip a nigga little bit of nothin'
I chip a nigga little bit of nothin'
I chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like, "Bitch, I did that!"
X-rated

Johnny don't wanna go to school no mo', no mo'
Johnny said books ain't cool no mo' (no mo')
Johnny wanna be a rapper like his big cousin
Johnny caught a body yesterday out hustlin'
God bless America, you know we all love him

Yesterday I got a call like from my dog like 101
Said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds
He was sobbin', he was mobbin', way belligerent and drunk
Talkin' out his head, philosophing on what the Lord had done
He said, "K-Dot, can you pray for me?
It's been a fucked-up day for me
I know that you anointed, show me how to overcome."
He was lookin' for some closure
Hopin' I could bring him closer
To the spiritual, my spirit do know better, but I told him
"I can't sugarcoat the answer for you, this is how I feel:
If somebody kill my son, that mean somebody gettin' killed."
Tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of
All the memories collected, moments you could never touch

I wait in front a nigga's spot and watch him hit his block
I catch a nigga leavin' service if that's all I got
I chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like, "Bitch, I did that!"
Ain't no Black Power when your baby killed by a coward
I can't even keep the peace, don't you fuck with one of ours
It be murder in the street, it be bodies in the hour
Ghetto bird be on the street, paramedics on the dial
Let somebody touch my mama
Touch my sister, touch my woman
Touch my daddy, touch my niece
Touch my nephew, touch my brother

You should chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Matter fact, I'm 'bout to speak at this convention
Call you back-

Alright, kids, we're gonna talk about gun control
(Pray for me) Damn!

[Bono:]
It's not a place
This country is to me a sound of drum and bass
You close your eyes to look around

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Hail Mary, Jesus and Joseph
The great American flag
Is wrapped in drag with explosives
Compulsive disorder, sons and daughters
Barricaded blocks and borders
Look what you taught us!
It's murder on my street, your street, back streets
Wall Street, corporate offices
Banks, employees, and bosses with
Homicidal thoughts; Donald Trump's in office
We lost Barack and promised to never doubt him again
But is America honest, or do we bask in sin?
Pass the gin, I mix it with American blood
Then bash him in, you Crippin' or you married to Blood?
I'll aks again-oops-accident
It's nasty when you set us up
Then roll the dice, then bet us up
You overnight the big rifles, then tell Fox to be scared of us
Gang members or terrorists, et cetera, et cetera
America's reflections of me, that's what a mirror does

[Bono:]
It's not a place
This country is to me a sound of drum and bass
You close your eyes to look ar-

Poverty's paradise
I don't think I could find a way to make it on this earth
(I've been hungry all my life)

[Carl Duckworth:]
What's up, family?
Yeah, it's your cousin Carl, man, just givin' you a call, man
I know you been havin' a lot on yo' mind lately
And I know you feel like, you know
People ain't been prayin' for you
But you have to understand this, man, that we are a cursed people
Deuteronomy 28:28 says, "The Lord shall smite thee with madness And blindness, and astonishment of heart"
See, family, that's why you feel like you feel
Like you got a chip on your shoulder
Until you follow His commandments, you gonna feel that way

[Charles Edward Sydney Isom Jr.:]
Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?
Pain in my heart carry burdens full of struggle
Why God, why God do I gotta bleed?
Every stone thrown at you restin' at my feet
Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?
Earth is no more, won't you burn this muh'fucka?

I beat yo' ass, keep talkin' back
I beat yo' ass, who bought you that?
You stole it, I beat yo' ass if you say that game is broken
I beat yo' ass if you jump on my couch
I beat yo' ass if you walk in this house
With tears in your eyes, runnin' from Poo Poo and Prentice
Go back outside, I beat yo' ass, lil' nigga
That homework better be finished, I beat yo' ass
Your teachers better not be bitchin' 'bout you in class
That pizza better not be wasted, you eat it all
That TV better not be loud if you got it on
Them Jordans better not get dirty when I just bought 'em
Better not hear 'bout you humpin' on Keisha's daughter
Better not hear you got caught up
I beat yo' ass, you better not run to your father
I beat yo' ass, you know my patience runnin' thin
I got buku payments to make
County building's on my ass, tryna take my food stamps away
I beat yo' ass if you tell them social workers he live here
I beat yo' ass if I beat yo' ass twice and you still here
Seven years old, think you run this house by yourself?
Nigga, you gon' fear me if you don't fear no one else

If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that motherfucker up
And then I'd take two puffs
I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)
I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)
Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now
(Pull them panties to the side now)
I don't think I could find a way to make it on this earth

I'll prolly die anonymous, I'll prolly die with promises
I'll prolly die walkin' back home from the candy house
I'll prolly die because these colors are standin' out
I'll prolly die because I ain't know Demarcus was snitchin'
I'll prolly die at these house parties, fuckin' with bitches
I'll prolly die from witnesses leavin' me false-accused
I'll prolly die from thinkin' that me and your hood was cool
Or maybe die from pressin' the line, actin' too extra
Or maybe die because these smokers are more than desperate
I'll prolly die from one of these bats and blue badges
Body-slammed on black and white paint, my bones snappin'
Or maybe die from panic or die from bein' too lax
Or die from waitin' on it, die 'cause I'm movin' too fast
I'll prolly die tryna buy weed at the apartments
I'll prolly die tryna diffuse two homies arguin'
I'll prolly die 'cause that's what you do when you're 17
All worries in a hurry, I wish I controlled things

If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that motherfucker up
And then I'd take two puffs
(I've been hungry all my life)
I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)
I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)
Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now

Now

When I was 27, I grew accustomed to more fear
Accumulated 10 times over throughout the years
My newfound life made all of me magnified
How many accolades do I need to block denial?
The shock value of my success put bolts in me
All this money, is God playin' a joke on me?
Is it for the moment, and will he see me as Job?
Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before?
At 27, my biggest fear was losin' it all
Scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall
Scared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin'
30 shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus
What is an advisor? Somebody that's holdin' my checks
Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?
I read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered
How did the Bad Girl feel when she looked at them numbers?
The type of shit'll make me flip out and just kill somethin'
Drill somethin', get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'
I practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck
At 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged
How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city
What they say 'bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me
What they see from me would trickle down generations in time
What they hear from me would make 'em highlight my simplest lines

I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity
I'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride
'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God
I'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone
I'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more
I'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness
Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully, they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap
Damn

[Bēkon:]
God damn you, God damn me
God damn us, God damn we
God damn us all

[Carl Duckworth:]
Verse 2 says, "You only have I known of all the families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities"
So until we come back to these commandments
Until you come back to these commandments
We're gonna feel this way, we're gonna be under this curse
Because He said He's gonna punish us
The so-called blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians
Are the true children of Israel
We are the Israelites, according to the Bible
The children of Israel
He's gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience
Because we chose to follow other gods
That man chastens his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee
So, just like you chasten your own son, He's gonna chasten you
Because He loves you, so that's why we get chastised
That's why we're in the position that we're in
Until we come back to these laws, statutes, and commandments
And do what the Lord says, these curses are gonna be upon us
We're gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live
Here, in today, in the United States of America
I love you, family, and I pray for you
God bless you
Shalom


This what God feel like, huh, he-yeah
Laughin' to the bank like, "A-ha!", huh, he-yeah
Flex on swole like, "A-ha!", huh, he-yeah
You feel some type of way, then a-ha!
Huh, he-yeah (A-ha-ha, a-ha-ha)

Ever since a young man (Since a young man)
All I wanna be was a gunman (Was a gunman)
Shootin' up the charts, better run, man

Slick as El DeBarge with the finger waves, work it, JT
Handle bars like a fade, watch me work it, JT
I'm at large, runnin' plays like a circuit, JT
I'm sellin' verses, JT, watch me work it, JT
Look, look... hol' up!
Don't judge me! My mama caught me with a strap
Don't judge me! I was young, fuckin' all the brats
Don't judge me! Aimin' at your head for a stack
Don't judge! Don't judge me! Now my home got a Valley peak
Don't judge me! If I press your line you a freak
Don't judge me! Won't you tell a friend? Y'all gon' see—

Fuck is you talkin' to?
Ayy, do you know who you talkin' to?
Slide on you like fallen drapes
God toss full of carnivals
I kill 'em with kindness
Or I kill 'em with diamonds
Or I put up like fifteen hundred
Get yo' ass killed by the finest
Everything in life is a gamble
Nothin' in life I can't handle
Seen it all, done it all, felt pain more
For the cause, I done put blood on sword
Everything I do is to embrace y'all
Everything I write is a damn eight ball
Everything I touch is a damn gold mine
Everything I say is from an angel

I don't rush shit, fuck shit, always your shit, my shit
Cannonballs to ignite shit, morning to the night shift
I'm on, I ain't sorry for it
Asked for a piece of mind, you charged me for it
I wanna see sometimes if you ignore it
I'm in the streets sometimes and can't afford it
I got a bad habit, levitatin', duckin' haters
Oh my! My heart is rich, my heart is famous

This what God feel like
Huh, he-yeah (This what God feel like)
Laughin' to the bank like, "A-ha!"

[Sample of Ted Taylor:]
Darling, I told you many times
And I am telling you once again
Just to remind you, sweetheart
That my—

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Oh, Lamar
Hail Mary and marijuana, times is hard
Pray with the hooligans, shadows all in the dark
Fellowship with demons and relatives, I'm a star
Life is one funny ma'fucker
A true comedian, you gotta love him, you gotta trust him
I might be buggin', infomercials and no sleep
Introverted by my thoughts; children, listen, it gets deep
See, once upon a time inside the Nickerson Garden projects
The object was to process and digest poverty's dialect
Adaptation inevitable: gun violence, crack spot
Federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals
Anthony was the oldest of seven
Well-respected, calm and collected
Laughin' and jokin' made life easier; hard times, mama on crack
A four-year-old tellin' his nanny he needed her
His family history: pimpin' and bangin'
He was meant to be dangerous, clocked him a grip and start slangin'
Fifteen, scrapin' up his jeans with quarter pieces
Even got some head from a smoker last weekend
Dodged a policeman, workin' for his big homie
Small-time hustler, graduated to a brick on him
Ten-thousand dollars out of a project housing, that's on the daily
Seen his first mill' twenty years old, had a couple of babies
Had a couple of shooters, caught a murder case
Fingerprints on the gun they assumin', but witnesses couldn't prove it
That was back when he turned his back and they killed his cousin
He beat the case and went back to hustlin'
Bird-shufflin', Anthony rang
The first in the projects with the two-tone Mustang, that 5.0 thing
They say 5-0 came, circlin' parking lots and parking spots
And hoppin' out while harrassin' the corner blocks
Crooked cops told Anthony he should kick it
He brushed 'em off and walked back to the Kentucky Fried Chicken
See, at this chicken spot, there was a light-skinned nigga that talked a lot
With a curly top and a gap in his teeth, he worked the window
His name was Ducky, he came from the streets, The Robert Taylor Homes
Southside Projects, Chiraq, the Terror Dome
Drove to California with a woman on him and five-hundred dollars
They had a son, hopin' that he'd see college
Hustlin' on the side with a nine-to-five to freak it
Cadillac Seville, he'd ride his son around on weekends
Three-piece special with his name on the shirt pocket
'Cross the street from the projects, Anthony planned to rob it
Stuck up the place before, back in '84
That's when affiliation was really at gears of war
So many relatives tellin' us, sellin' us devilish works, killin' us, crime
Intelligent, felonious prevalent proposition with 9's
Ducky was well-aware
They robbed the manager and shot a customer last year
He figured he'd get on these niggas' good sides
Free chicken every time Anthony posted in line, two extra biscuits
Anthony liked him and then let him slide, they didn't kill him
In fact, it look like they're the last to survive, pay attention
That one decision changed both of they lives, one curse at a time
Reverse the manifest and good karma, and I'll tell you why
You take two strangers and put 'em in random predicaments
Give 'em a soul, so they can make their own choices and live with it
Twenty years later, them same strangers, you make 'em meet again
Inside recording studios where they reapin' their benefits
Then you start remindin' them about that chicken incident
Whoever thought the greatest rapper would be from coincidence?
Because if Anthony killed Ducky, Top Dawg could be servin' life
While I grew up without a father and die in a gunfight

That one decision changed both of they lives, one curse at a time
Pay attention
But care
Cocaine quarter since one like this, immaculate concept
Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I got, I got, I got, I got
So, I was takin' a walk the other day


(Why I go easy?)
(Know why I go easy)
Wait

King of my city, king of my country, king of my homeland
King of the filthy, king of the fallen, we livin' again
King of the shooters, looters, boosters, and ghettos poppin'
King of the past, present, future, my ancestors watchin'
King of the culture, king of the soldiers, king of the bloodshed
King of the wisdom, king of the ocean, king of the respect
King of the optimistics and dreamers that go and get it
King of the winner's district and geniuses with conviction
King of the fighters, king of the fathers, king of the belated
King of the answer, king of the problem, king of the forsaken
King of the empathy, your resentment, king of remorse
King of my enemies, may they fall defeat, I rejoice
King of the skyscrapers, dodgin' haters, broke religion
Nine faces, go against 'em, I erased 'em with precision
I embrace them with collision, kings did it
King's vision, Black Panther, King Kendrick, all hail the king!
I dropped a million tears
I know several responsibilities put me here
I don't pedal backwards, but I live old-fashioned
The lens that I'm lookin' through
Won't prescribe me the right glasses, masses are now free
Ashes I'm dumpin' out, 'bout to spread all 'cross seas
Sisters and brothers in unison, not because of me
Because we don't glue with the opposition, we glue with peace
But still'd fuck up your organization if any beef
What do you stand for?
Are you a activist? What are your city plans for?
Are you a accident? Are you just in the way?
Your native tongue contradictin' what your body language say
Are you a king or you jokin'? Are you a king or you posin'?
Are you a king or you smokin' bowl rocks to keep you open?
Because the king don't cry, king don't die
King don't lie, king give all, king get by, king don't fall
Kingdom come, when I come, you know why
(King, king, king, king)
I am T'Challa!

Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt)
I know the feeling haunt you (Haunt)

This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Tell me what you gon' do to me
Confrontation ain't nothin' new to me
You can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue
But you can't bring the truth to me
Fuck you and all your expectations
I don't even want your congratulations
I recognize your false confidence
And calculated promises all in your conversation
I hate people that feel entitled
Look at me crazy 'cause I ain't invite you
Oh, you important?
You the moral to the story? You endorsin'?
Motherfucker, I don't even like you
Corrupt a man's heart with a gift
That's how you find out who you dealin' with
A small percentage who I'm buildin' with
I want the credit if I'm losin' or I'm winnin'
On my momma, that's the realest shit

Love, let's talk about love

Skin covered in ego
Get to talkin' like ya involved, like a rebound
Got no end game, got no ways out, got to stay down
It's the way that you making me feel
Like nobody ever loved me like you do, you do
You kinda feeling like you're tryna get away from me
If you do, I won't move
I ain't just cry for no reason, I ain't just pray for no reason
I give thanks for the days, for the hours
And another way, another life breathin'
I did it all 'cause it feel good
I wouldn't do it at all if it feel bad
Better live your life, we're runnin' out of time

Want me gone, sent a shot, like the real kind
These niggas actin' like they tough when they real kind
Thumbin' through a 100 racks just to kill time
They got a nigga at the edge, but I feel fine
But it come with this shit, I'm okay with it
If your man's to his last share a plate wit' 'em
One whole wood to the neck, it's an eighth in it
New baby chop, let it sing, it's a Drake nigga
A lot of shit on my mind make me think a lot
Why it's hard for me to smile? 'Cause I seen a lot
You ain't really in the field, you just tweet a lot
If we ain't on the same page, you can kick a rock, bitch!

So at 8 I made the choice I'ma forever be a G, and
I don't really like to talk
I remember we was broke and I don't really like to walk, nigga
Now I ride around in foreign cars
And I put on for my team who was with me from the start, nigga
I don't play games, stitch lip, I don't say names
She want a dog, I'm a Great Dane
I got great aim, Ice Age on my damn chain
My mamma told me keep a stash for the damn rain
They ain't wanna see me win 'cause I'm black
So I pulled up in that all black Benz in the back
If you need someone to call, I'm the man for the task
You ain't standin' for the 'cause, meet the man in the mask

I hope you find some peace of mind in this lifetime

I hope you find some paradise
(Tell 'em, tell 'em the truth)
(Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em your—)
I've been goin' through somethin'
One-thousand eight-hundred and fifty-five days
I've been goin' through somethin'
Be afraid

What is a bitch in a miniskirt?
A man in his feelings with bitter nerve
What is a woman that really hurt?
A demon, you're better off killing her
What is a relative making repetitive narratives
On how you did it first?
That is a predator, hit reverse
All of your presidents' evil thirst
What is a neighborhood rep'table?
That is a snitch on a pedestal
What is a house with a better view?
A family broken in variables
What is a rapper with jewelry?
A way that I show my maturity
What if I call on security?
That mean I'm calling on God for purity
I went and got me a therapist
I can debate on my theories and sharing it (Woah)
Consolidate all my comparisons
Humblin' up because time was imperative (Woah)
Started to feel like it's only one answer
To everything, I don't know where it is (Woah)
Popping a bottle of Claritin (Woah)
Is it my head or my arrogance? (Woah)
Shaking and moving, like, what am I doing?
I'm flipping my time through the Rolodex
Indulging myself and my life and my music
The world that I'm in is a cul-de-sac
The world that we in is just menacing
The demons portrayed as religionous
I wake in the morning, another appointment
I hope the psychologist listenin'

The new Mercedes with black G-Wagon
The "Where you from?", it was all for rap
I was 28 years young, twenty mill' in tax
Bought a couple of mansions, just for practice
Five hundred in jewelry, chain was magic
Never had it in public, late reaction
50K to cousins, post a caption
Pray none of my enemies hold me captive

I grieve different
I grieve different (Huh)

I met her on the third night of Chicago
North America tour, my enclave
Fee-fi-fo-fum, she was a model
Dedicated to the songs I wrote and the Bible
Eyes like green penetratin' the moonlight
Hair done in a bun, energy in the room like
Big Bang for theory, God, hopin' you hear me
Phone off the ringer, tell the world, "I'm busy"
Fair enough, green eyes said her mother didn't care enough
Sympathize when her daddy in the chain gang
Her first brother got killed, he was twenty-one
I was nine when they put Lamont in the grave
Heartbroken when Estelle didn't say goodbye
Chad left his body after we FaceTimed
Green eyes said you'd be okay, first tour, sex the pain away

I grieve different
I grieve different (Huh)

The new Mercedes with black G-Wagon
The "Where you from?", it was all for rap
I was 28 years young, twenty mill' in tax
Bought a couple of mansions, just for practice
Five hundred in jewelry, chain was magic
Never had it in public, late reaction
50K to cousins, post a caption
Pray none of my enemies hold me captive

So what, paralyzed, the county building controlled us
I bought a Rolex watch, I only wore it once
I bought infinity pools I never swimmed in
I watched Keem buy four cars in four months
You know the family dynamics on repeat
The insecurities locked down on PC
I bought a .223, nobody peace treat
You won't doo-doo me, I smell TNT
Dave got him a Porsche, so I got me a Porsche
Paid lottery for it, I ain't want it in portions
Poverty was the case
But the money wipin' the tears away

I grieve different
(Everybody grieves different)
(Everybody grieves different)
I grieve different (Huh)


Hello, new world, all the boys and girls
I got some true stories to tell
You're back outside, but they still lied
Woah-oh-oh-oh (Yeah)

Take off the foo-foo, take off the clout chase, take off the Wi-Fi
Take off the money phone, take off the car loan, take off the flex and the white lies
Take off the weird-ass jewelry, I'ma take ten steps, then I'm taking off top five
Take off them fabricated streams and them microwave memes, it's a real world outside (Take that shit off)
Take off your idols, take off the runway, I take off to Cairo (Take that shit off)
Take off to Saint-Tropez, five-day stay, take a quarter mill', hell, if I know (Take that shit off)
Take off the front flag, take off perception, take off the cop with the eye patch (Take that shit off)
Take off the unloyal, take off the unsure, take off decisions I lack (Take it off)
Take off the fake deep, take off the fake woke, take off the, "I'm broke, I care" (Take it off)
Take off the gossip, take off the new logic that if I'm rich, I'm rare (Take it off)
Take off the Chanel, take off the Dolce, take off the Birkin bag
(Take it off)
Take all that designer bullshit off, and what do you have?

Bitch, huh, huh, ugh
You ugly as fuck (You outta pocket)
Huh, two ATMs (Hah, hah, hah, hah)
You steppin' or what? (You outta pocket, huh)
Who you think they talk about?
Talk about us (You outta pocket—shoot, shoot, shoot)
Who you think they copy off? (Brrt, brrt, brrt, brrt)
Copy off us (Get back in pocket)

The world in a panic, the women is stranded, the men on a run
The prophets abandoned, the law take advantage, the market is crashin', the industry wants
Niggas and bitches to sleep in a box while they makin' a mockery followin' us
This ain't Monopoly, watchin' for love, this ain't monogamy, y'all gettin' fucked
Jumpin' on what the hell is that? I gotta relax when I feel (Huh, facts)
All my descendants, they come in my sleep and say I am too real (Huh, facts)
I'm done with the sensitive, takin' it personal, done with the black and the white, the wrong and the right
You hopin' for change and clericals, I know the feelings that came with burial's cries

Bitch, huh, huh, ugh
You ugly as fuck (You outta pocket)
Huh, two ATMs (Hah, hah, hah, hah)
You steppin' or what? (You outta pocket, huh)
Who you think they talk about?
Talk about us (You outta pocket—shoot, shoot, shoot)
Who you think they copy off? (Brrt, brrt, brrt, brrt)
Copy off us

Servin' up a look, dancin' in a drought
Hello to the big stepper, never losin' count
Ventin' in the safe house
Ventin' in the sa—

Can I vent all my truth? I got nothin' to lose, I got problems and pools, I can swim on my faith
Cameras movin' whenever I'm movin', the family suin' whatever I make
Murder is stackin', the president actin', the government taxin' my funds in the bank
Homies attracting the feds when I'm bracking, look at my reaction, my pupils on skates (Hold up, hold up)
Let's think about this for a second (Let's go)
Tell me what you would do for aesthetic (Let's go)
Would you sell your soul on credit? (Let's go)
Would you sell your bro for leverage? (Let's go)
Where the hypocrites at?
What community feel they the only ones relevant? (Let's go)
Where the hypocrites at?
What community feel they the only ones relevant? (Let's go)

Huh, huh, ugh
You outta pocket, yeah, you outta pocket (This shit hard)
You entertain the mediocre, need to stop it (This shit hard)
You entertainin' old friends when they toxic (This shit hard)
What your life like? Bullshit and gossip (This shit hard)
What the fuck is cancel culture, dawg?
Say what I want about you niggas, I'm like Oprah, dawg
I treat you crackers like I'm Jigga, watch, I own it all
Oh, you worried 'bout a critic? That ain't protocol (Bitch)


Kodak Black, Oklama
Eckhart Tolle
And this here is the big stepper

I'm a killer, he's a killer, she's a killer, bitch
We some killers, walkin' zombies, tryna scratch that itch
Germophobic, hetero and—

I am not for the faint of heart
My genetic build can build multi-universes, the man of God
Playin' "Baby Shark" with my daughter
Watchin' for sharks outside at the same time
Life as a protective father, I'd kill for her
My son Enoch is the part two
When I expire, my children'll make higher valleys
In this present moment, I saw that through
Ask Whitney about my lust addiction
Text messagin' bitches got my thumbs hurt
Set precedent for a new sacrilegion
Writer's block for two years, nothin' moved me
Asked God to speak through me, that's what you hearin' now
The voice of yours truly
Teleport out my own body for comfort
I don't pass judgment, past life regressions keep me in question
Where did I come from? I don't think like I used to
No, I don't blink like I used to
Awkward stares at everybody, see the flesh of man
But still, this man compared to nobody
Yesterday, I prayed to the flowers and trees
Gratification to the powers that be
Synchronization with my energy chakras, the ghost of Dr. Sebi
Paid it forward, cleaned out my toxins, bacteria heavy
Sciatica nerve pinch, I don't know how to feel
Like the first time I fucked a white bitch

The first time I fucked a white bitch
I was sixteen at the Palisades
Fumblin' my grades, I traveled with the team
The Apache life, Centennial was like
When Mrs. Baker screamed at Doughboy
Mixed that with Purple Rain
They interchanged the scenes
Happy just to be out the hood
With all the wealthy kids
Credit cards and family plans
She drove her daddy's Benz
I found out that he was a sheriff
That was a win-win
Because he had locked up Uncle Perry
She paid her daddy's sins
Next time I fucked a white bitch
Was out in Copenhagen
Good kid, m.A.A.d city tour
I flourished on them stages
Whitney asked did I have a problem
I said, "I might be racist"
Ancestors watchin' me fuck was like retaliation

I'm a killer, he's a killer, she's a killer, bitch
We some killers, walkin' zombies, tryna scratch that itch
Germophobic, hetero and homophobic
Photoshoppin' lies and motives
Hide your eyes, then pose for the pic

What the—

Eight billion people on Earth, silent murderers
Non-profits, preachers and church, crooks and burglars (Woo)
Hollywood corporate in school, teachin' philosophies
You either gon' be dead or in jail, killer psychology
Silent murderer, what's your body count? Who your sponsorship?
Objectified so many bitches, I killed their confidence (What the—)
The media's the new religion, you killed the consciousness
(What the fuck?)
Your jealousy is way too pretentious, you killed accomplishments (What the fuck?)
Niggas killed freedom of speech, everyone sensitive (What the fuck?)
If your opinion fuck 'round and leak, might as well send your will (What the—)
The industry has killed the creators, I'll be the first to say (What the fuck?)
To each exec', "I'm saving your children"—We can't negotiate (What the—)
I caught a couple of bodies myself, slid my community
My last Christmas toy drive in Compton handed out eulogies
Not because the rags in the park had red gradient
But because the high blood pressure flooded the caterin'
So what's the difference 'tween your life when hiding motives?
More fatalities and reality bring you closure
The noble person that goes to work and pray like they 'posed to?
Slaughter people too, your murder's just a bit slower


I'm a killer, he's a killer, she's a killer, bitch
(What the fuck?)
We some killers, walkin' zombies, tryna scratch that itch
(What the—)
Germophobic, hetero and homophobic
Photoshoppin' lies and motives
Hide your eyes, then pose for the pic'


[Kendrick Lamar:]
I pop the pain away, I slide the pain away
I pop the pain away, I slide the pain away

I wonder where I lost my way
Mmm, ah-ah
Been waiting on your call all day
Tell me you in my corner right now
When I fall short, I'm leaning on you to cry out
We all got enough to lie about
My truth too complicated to hide now
Can I open up? Is it safe or not?
I'm afraid a little, you relate or not?
Have faith a little, I might take my time
Ain't no saving face this time

[Blxst:]
I hope I'm not too late to set my demons straight
I know I made you wait, but how much can you take?
I hope you see the God in me, I hope you can see

I got some regrets (I-I-I, yeah, yeah)
But my past won't keep me from my best (I-I-I, yeah, yeah)
Subtle mistakes felt like life or death (I-I-I, yeah, yeah)
I wanna see the family stronger
I wanna see the money longer
You know that I'd die for you (I'd die for you)
I get emotional about life
The lost ones keepin' me up at night
The world be reminding me it's danger
I'll still risk it all for a stranger
If I told you who I am, would you use it against me?
Right or wrong, no stone, just love to send me

[Blxst:]
I hope I'm not too late to set my demons straight
I know I made you wait, but how much can you take?
I hope you see the God in me, I hope you can see
And if it's up, stay down for me, yeah

Baby, you make me pray for London
Yeah, 'cause if I won it all without you involved (Fucking love you)
I guess it's all for nothing


You really need some therapy
Real nigga need no therapy, fuck you talkin' about?
Nah, nah, you sound stupid as fuck
Shit, everybody stupid
Yeah, well, you need to talk to somebody
Reach out to Eckhart

I come from a generation of home invasions and I got daddy issues, that's on me
Everything them four walls had taught me, made habits bury deep
That man knew a lot, but not enough to keep me past them streets
My life is a plot, twisted from directions that I can't see
Daddy issues ball across my head, told me, "Fuck a foul"
I'm teary-eyed, wanna throw my hands, I won't think out loud
A foolish pride, if I lose again, won't go in the house
I stayed outside, laughin' with my friends, they don't know my life
Daddy issues made me learn losses, I don't take those well
Momma said, "That boy is exhausted," he said, "Go fuck yourself
If he give up now, that's gon' cost him, life's a bitch
You could be a bitch or step out the margin," I got up quick
I'm chargin' baskets and falling backwards, tryna keep balance
Oh, this the part where mental stability meets talent
Oh, this the part, he breaks my humility just for practice
Tactics we learned together, sore losers forever, daddy issues

Early mornin' wake-ups (Ah), practicin' on day-offs (Ah)
Tough love (Ah), bottled up, no chaser (Ah)
Neat, no chaser (Ah), neat, no chaser (Ah)
Neat, no chaser (Ah), neat, no chase
Early mornin' wake-ups (Ah), practicin' on day-offs (Ah, day-offs)
Tough love (Ah), bottled up, no chaser (Ah)
Neat, no chaser (Ah), neat, no chaser (Ah)
Neat, no chaser (Ah), neat, no chaser

I got daddy issues, that's on me
Lookin' for, "I love you", rarely empathizin' for my relief
A child that grew accustomed, jumping up when I scraped my knee
'Cause if I cried about it, he'd surely tell me not to be weak
Daddy issues, hid my emotions, never expressed myself
Men should never show feelings, being sensitive never helped
His momma died, I asked him why he goin' back to work so soon?
His first reply was, "Son, that's life, the bills got no silver spoon"
Daddy issues, fuck everybody, go get your money, son
Protect yourself, trust nobody, only your momma'n'em
This made relationships seem cloudy, never attached to none
So if you took some likings around me, I might reject the love
Daddy issues kept me competitive, that's a fact, nigga
I don't give a fuck what's the narrative, I am that nigga
When Kanye got back with Drake, I was slightly confused
Guess I'm not mature as I think, got some healin' to do
Egotistic, zero-given fucks and to be specific (Ah)
Need assistance with the way I was brought up (Ah, ah)
What's the difference when your heart is made of stone
And your mind is made of gold
And your tongue is made of sword, but it may weaken your soul?
My niggas ain't got no daddy, grow up overcompensatin'
Learn shit 'bout bein' a man and disguise it as bein' gangsta
I love my father for tellin' me to take off the gloves
'Cause everything he didn't want was everything I was
And to my partners that figured it out without a father
I salute you, may your blessings be neutral to your toddlers
It's crucial, they can't stop us if we see the mistakes
'Til then, let's give the women a break, grown men with daddy issues

Early mornin' wake-ups (Ah), practicin' on day-offs (Ah, day-offs)
Tough love (Ah), bottled up, no chaser (Ah)
Neat, no chaser (Ah), neat, no chaser (Ah)
Neat, no chaser (Ah), neat, no chaser


I learned in trappin', in the business
Smart people makin' horrible decisions, you know?
Rich nigga, gettin' my dick sucked after the show
I ain't gon' lie, we were poor
A bunch of lost souls in survival mode
It wasn't no way for us unless we found our own
Runnin' in stores, kickin' in doors, nigga, give me my glory
Nigga play with me, he ain't gon' live to tell the story
You know, this the type of shit we glorify, everybody gang-gang
Most of the people that you grew up with are now in the chain gang
In the box, gettin' pink
Niggas shittin' where you sleep
Niggas shittin' where you eat
Who'da ever knew that I'd become a fuckin' Kodak? Yeah
Rap money good, but I'm still pumpin' gas through the hood
Droppin' off plates to the fam' like Thanksgivin'
Got the baby snipers standin' on that murk business, yeah, slidin' for Yak
They ready for whatever
I always knew that everything would get better
And it sho' got greater later
All the game came from the elders like hand-me-downs
Me and my brothers wearin' hand-me-downs
Now I'm givin' game back to the old heads
And the respect come first, yeah, you know?
Can't be better than the OGs, you gotta get it somewhere
Gotta come from somethin', God don't come from nothin'
We ain't seen this comin', nigga, it's more than a blessin'
What you doing with Kendrick? (Ooh, ooh)
What you doing with a legend? (Ooh, ooh)
So what they call you? (Ooh, ooh)
When it's all said and done, we ain't leavin' empty-handed (Ooh, ooh)
That's on gang (Ooh, ooh)
That's on Ma' Dukes (Ooh, ooh)
Poorer than that bitch but she fall through (Ooh, ooh)
Makin' ends meet (Ooh, ooh), daddy deadbeat (Ooh, ooh)
Had to steal for a meal or you can't eat, you know? (Ooh, ooh)
Poverty (Ooh, ooh)
Red Cross, food banks, W.I.C. (Ooh, ooh)
Now look at this shit, we own property


Takin' my baby to school, then I pray for her
'Cause you bitches ain't never been cool, writin' testament
Paintin' pictures, put me in the Louvre, that's a definite
Universal shift, I'm in a groove
And celebrity do not mean integrity, you fool
I'm a good man, shake your hand, firm grip rule
Seventy-two wins, lost ten, ballin' with the flu
More than two M's for a show, but add another two
Hmm, lil' Man-Man, the big mans
The GT Dyno flippin' the kickstand, ooh

Rich nigga, broke phone (Ah)
Tryna keep the balance, I'm stayin' strong (Ooh)
Stop playin' with me 'fore I turn you to a song (Yeah)
Stop playin' with me 'fore I turn you to a song (Ooh)
Ayy, bitch, I'm attractive (Ah)
Can't fuck with you no more, I'm fastin', ugh (Ooh)
Bitch, I'm attractive (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Can't fuck with you no more, I'm fastin', ugh

The morality can wait, feedback on low latency, I'm glitching from the face
As my thoughts grow sacredly, I'm runnin' out of space
Ask Whitney, she okay, never mind a hundred K
Why you lyin' on Benjamin? He turnin' in his grave
I'd be lyin' if I said I wouldn't give this shit away
The aloof Buddha, I'm Christ with a shooter
Praise to Muhammad, I might nigga noose ya
AP, Michael Friedman, my friends cooler
Primary, so the resale value stupid
I would never live my life on a computer
IG'll get you life for a chikabooya
More power to ya, love 'em from a distance
Why you always in the mirror more than the bitches?
And my cousin tried to sue me like he got the privilege
But I didn't lose sleep 'cause I got the spirit, ayy (Ooh)

Rich nigga, broke phone (Ah)
Tryna keep the balance, I'm stayin' strong (Ooh)
Stop playin' with me 'fore I turn you to a song (Yeah)
Stop playin' with me 'fore I turn you to a song (Ooh)
Ayy, bitch, I'm attractive (Ah)
Can't fuck with you no more, I'm fastin', ugh (Ooh)
Bitch, I'm attractive (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Can't fuck with you no more, I'm fastin', ugh

Dun-duh, dun-duh, dun-duh, duh, dum
Dun-duh-duh, duh, duh
Dun-duh, dun-duh, dun-duh, dun-duh, dun

Frat brother, real nigga, that brother
We just upped the score, give me dap, brother
Spirit medium, I don't rap, brother
We headed there now, are you strapped brother?
Ayy, peacemaker, but I'm not naive, brother
Ayy, gotta watch your homies and police, brother
Ayy, clout chasing hell of a disease, brother
I'm fasting four days out the week, brother
I pray to God that you realize the entourage is dead
I pray to God that you not lackin' when you off the meds
I pray to God she know them Cabo trips don't last forever
Bet she argue with her momma, go and get them kids
I pray to God you actually pray when somebody dies
Thoughts and prayers, way better off timelines
False claimin' not cute, I'm mortified
The new Earth in hot pursuit, two-hundred lives

Rich nigga, broke phone (Ah)
Tryna keep the balance, I'm stayin' strong (Ooh)
Stop playin' with me 'fore I turn you to a song (Yeah)
Stop playin' with me 'fore I turn you to a song (Ooh)

Nah, fuck you, nigga (Fuck you, bitch)
Oh, wow, okay

Unstable-ass, confrontational-ass dumb bitches
You wanna bring a nigga down, even when I'm tryna do right
We could go our separate ways right now, you could move on with your life (I swear to God)
Fuck you nigga, you love a pity party, I won't show up
Always act like your shit don't stink, motherfucker, grow up (Man, fuck you)

Wastin' my time and energy tryna be good to you
Lost friends, family, gained more enemies 'cause of you
Bitches starin' at me in Zara, hoes scratchin' my cars up
Shoulda followed my mind in '09 and just moved to Georgia
Oh, what, that's my fault now? Bitch, you power trippin' or guilt trippin'? (Okay)
I held your ass down
You just kept me down, that's a big difference
Stressin' myself tryna figure why I'm not good enough
Goin' to church, prayin' for you, searchin' for good in us

Shoulda thought about cuffin' you, bitch
Nigga, you dirty and you broke
Ho, you goofy and gullible, fuck you talkin' 'bout?

Egotistic, narcissistic, love your own lies (Bro)

You the reason, we overlooked, underpaid, under-booked, under shame
If you look, I don't speak, then I'm called on my name (Hah...)
I am flawed, I am pained, never yours, I remained (Come on, bro)
You the reason bitches start fuckin' with bitches when they change
You the reason bitches start callin' y'all bitches 'cause y'all useless
You the reason Harvey Weinstein had to see his conclusion
You the reason R. Kelly can't recognize that he's abusive
Man, shut the fuck up, we all know you still playin' his music
Said I'm tired of these emotional-ass, ungrateful-ass bitches
Fake innocent, fake feminist, stop pretendin'
Y'all sentiments ain't realer than what you defendin'
(Here he go, shut the fuck up)
It's a split decision, broads like you and real victims (Look at you, look at you)
Let's talk the truth (Okay), women in general just can't get along (Explain, nigga)
Hmm, when Tash got a man, you didn't pick up the phone (Explain, nigga)
Uh-uh, when Nate got a job, you said you stayin' home (Explain)
Oh, why R&B bitches don't feature on each other songs then?
What the fuck is you talkin' 'bout?
Never mind, bitch, I'm walkin' out
Whatever, nigga, I'm off you now
Yo' evil ass kept me well in doubt
Pussy nigga, best watch your mouth

Stop tap-dancing around the conversation


Mmm, tippy-toeing and I'm mud-walkin', hmm
Rollin' sevens, I ain't ready for no coffin
I know y'all love it when the drugs talkin', but
Shut the fuck up when you hear love talkin'
Shut the fuck up when you hear love talkin'
If God be the source then I am the plug talkin'
Yeah, baby, yeah, baby
Yeah, baby, yeah, baby

This my undisputed truth, uh-huh
My life is like forbidden fruit, my bitch know better than I do
A woman's worth, I barely went to church, I'd rather fast with you
Than fuck it up, fucking with skirts 'cause I'm rational
A nigga still gon' be a nigga, emoji heart, my family pictures
Two-steppin' away from rappers, I don't trust their true intentions
I'm not in the music business, I been in the human business
Whole life been social distant, hoes like, "When you not trippin'?"
I duck the party, who said they saw me?
Crown on Bob Marley, wrist on Yo Gotti
They gon' judge your life for a couple likes on the double tap
Them hoes is sorry, they all get bodied
I bless it that you have an open heart, I bless that you forgive
I bless it that you can learn from a loss, I bless it that you heal
I bless one day that you attract somebody with your mind exact
A patient life, flaws, bless 'em twice, and they'll bless you back

Tippy-toeing and I'm mud-walkin', hmm
Rollin' sevens, I ain't ready for no coffin
I know y'all love it when the drugs talkin', but
Shut the fuck up when you hear love talkin'
Shut the fuck up when you hear love talkin'
If God be the source, then I am the plug talkin'
Yeah, baby, yeah, baby
Yeah, baby, yeah

(How's love) How's love when it's heart to your soul?
But my nigga left, his ass on the road
Gossiping 'bout some shit you don't know
Oh, you ho (Yeah, yeah, yeah, fasho)
I hate it here, baby daddy still on my phone
I hate it here, asking if I been on the pole
I hate it here, if you keep lurking on the low
If you a fan, just let me know
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Now if it's love, I deserve to get some head on a balcony sometimes, sometimes
And if I feel where your heart can be, you'll still be a part of me
I love mine, love mine (Love mine, love mine)
Summer in the storm, I cannot conform
(I cannot conform, I cannot conform)
I just might love you still, just think I love me more
It ain't love if you gon' judge me for my past
No, it ain't love if you ain't never eat my ass
It ain't love if you just only tie me down because you seen me in my bag
That's why I'm anti-everyone before this mask

Mmm, tippy-toeing and I'm mud-walkin', hmm
Rollin' sevens, I ain't ready for no coffin
I know y'all love it when the drugs talkin', but
Shut the fuck up when you hear love talkin'
Shut the fuck up when you hear love talkin'
If God be the source, then I am the plug talkin'
Yeah, baby, yeah, baby
Yeah, baby, yeah

Yo, yo
Telekinesis, I'm purifying these D speeches
While I'm crying, I clean the feet of the sweet Jesus
Dreams, visions get blurry of the Elohim, it's light
It's known to tear retinas in a single gleam
Shut the fuck up when you hear His love talkin'
To the mind, it's God's cypher divine in a small portion, uh
Faded pictures, this global madness, the intervention
This world's in The Twilight Zone, this is the fifth dimension
God, please blow the whistle, we need an intermission
My good deeds in front of your door, I'm standing by the entrance
With heavy baggage, my brother's ashes
I seen tragic, I did dirt, smacked death and held it to that nigga cabbage
Love, we killin' greed, we killin' homelessness
And I don't give a fuck about this land, I want ownership
Bow your head for just God's sake
Listen what the stars say when I say it's God's way

Tippy-toeing and I'm mud-walkin', hmm
Rollin' sevens, I ain't ready for no coffin
I know y'all love it when the drugs talkin', but
Shut the fuck up when you hear love talkin'
Shut the fuck up when you hear love talkin'
If God be the source, then I am the plug talkin'
Yeah, baby, yeah, baby
Yeah, baby, yeah, baby


We may not know which way to go on this dark road
(Mr. Duckworth)
All of these hoes make it difficult
Session 10, breakthrough

One of these lives, I'ma make things right
With the wrongs I've done, that's when I unite
With the Father, Son, 'til then, I fight
Rain on me, put the blame on me
Got guilt, got hurt, got shame on me
Got six magazines that's aimed at me
Done every magazine, what's fame to me?
(And I'm tripping and falling)
It's a game to me, where the bedroom at?
Sleep, I ain't never had affairs with that
What's fair when the hearts and the words don't reach?
What's fair when the money don't take things back?
It's rare when somebody take your dreams back
(And I'm tripping and falling)
I care too much, wanna share too much, in my head too much
I shut down too, I ain't there too much
I'm a complex soul, they layered me up
Then broke me down, and morality's dust, I lack in trust
(And I'm tripping and falling)
This time around, I trust myself
Please everybody else but myself
All else fails, I was myself
Outdone fear, outdone myself
This year, you better one yourself
(And I'm tripping and falling)
Masks on the babies, mask on an opp
Wear masks in the neighborhood stores you shop
But a mask won't hide who you are inside
Look around, the reality's carved in lies
Wipe my ego, dodge my pride
(And I'm tripping and falling)
Look myself in the mirror
Amityville, ain't seen nothin' scarier
I fought like a pitbull terrier
Blood I shed could fill up aquariums
Tell all my angels, "Carry 'em"
(And I'm tripping and falling)
Every emotion been deprived
Even my strong points couldn't survive
If I didn't learn to love myself, forgive myself a hundred times, dawg

I love when you count me out (Huh)
I love when you count me out
I love when you count me out
(Wah, woo, wah, woo, wah)
I love when you count me out
Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuckin' it up
How you gon' win my trust when the lies run deep? (Wah, woo, wah)
How you gon' bend your love when the bad don't sleep? (Sheesh)
Beep, beep, crash our feelings in the middle of the street (Vroom, vroom)

Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuckin' it up (Huh, huh)

When you was at your lowest, tell me where the hoes was at?
When you was at your lowest, tell me where the bros was at?
Three-thirty in the mornin', scroll through the call log (Huh, huh, huh, huh)
Ain't nobody but the mirror lookin' for the fall off (Brrrt)

I love when you count me out
I love when you count me out
I love when you count me out
I love when you count me out
(Wah, woo, wah, woo, wah)
My name is in your mouth, shoo, shoo
It's gon' take more than pride to stop me
Call 9-1-1, I caught a body
Sun up now, and yesterday is fadin'
Healing's only 'bout a mile away
Let me tell you 'bout the woman I know (That's my baby)
I know karma like to follow us strong (Sheesh)
I know millionaires that feel alone (Sheesh)
Anytime I couldn't find God, I still could find myself through a song
Many find they life in a phone

Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuckin' it up

You said I'd feel better if I just worked hard without liftin' my head up
That left me fed up
You made me worry
I wanted my best version, but you ignored me
Then changed the story, then changed the story
Good energy in the room, drop the location, please
Antibiotic for the womb when I'm frustrated, please
(Antibiotic for the womb when I'm frustrated)
Tryna keep my good conscience in rotation
Thoughts in my head, they livin' there with no— (Tryna keep my good)
I made a decision, never give you my feelings
Fuck with you from, fuck with you from a distance
Some put it on the Devil when they fall short
I put it on my ego, lord of all lords
Sometimes I fall for her, dawg

I love when you count me out
I love when you count me out (Sheesh)
I love when you count me out (Sheesh)
I love when you count me out (Wah, woo, wah, woo, wah)
My name is in your mouth

Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuckin' it up (True, true)

Miss Regrets, I believe that you done me wrong (Miss Regrets)
Miss Regrets, can you please exit out my home? (Miss Regrets)
Miss Regret, I think I'm better off alone (Miss Regrets)
(Miss Regret) Miss Regret, I got these deep regrets
(And I'm tripping and falling)
Some things I can't forget
Lord knows, I tried my best
You said it's not my best
I came up out my flesh
Something's up, must confess (Ah, ya)
(And I'm tripping and falling)
Spoke my truth, paid my debt (Ah, ya)
Can't you see I'm a wreck? (Ah, ya)
Let me loose, I digress (Ah, ya)
This is me, and I'm blessed (Ah, ya)
This is me, and I'm blessed (Ah, ya)
This is me, and I'm blessed (Ah, ya)
This is me, and I'm blessed (Ah, ya)
Anybody fightin' through the stress? (Ah, ya)
Anybody fightin' through the—?


You walk around like everything is in control
Favor come with favors and you can't say no
Go out the way to make the coin available
That's what I call love
The closest ones afraid to say they need some time
The turnaround is life or death, but you don't mind
Go out the way to say you made the compromise
That's what I call love

But the time it'll come to not be there when somebody needs you
You say no and all you've done gives them amnesia
One thing I've learned, love can change with the seasons

And I can't please everybody
No, I can't please everybody
Wait, you can't please everybody
No, I can't please everybody
I can't please everybody

They idolize and praise your name across the nation
Tap the feet and nod the head for confirmation
Promise that you keep the music in rotation
That's what I call love (That's what I call love)

But the time it'll come (But the time it'll come)
To not be there when somebody needs you (When somebody needs you)
You say no and all you've done gives them amnesia (They don't remember)
One thing I've learned, love can change with the seasons

And I can't please everybody
No, I can't please everybody
Wait, you can't please everybody
No, I can't please everybody
And I can't please everybody
No, I can't please everybody
Wait, you can't please everybody
No, I can't please everybody

Heavy is the head that chose to wear the crown
To whom is given much is required now
Heavy is the head that chose to wear the crown
To whom is given much is required now

I can't please everybody (I can't please everybody)
I can't please everybody (I can't please everybody)
Love gon' get you killed (Love gon' get you killed)
Uh, I can't please everybody (I can't please everybody)
Uh, I can't even please myself (I can't even please myself)
Uh, I thought a new car would help (I thought a new car would help)
Uh, but when that new car get old (But when that new car get old)
Uh, I'm sure to want something else, I-I-I

[Kodak Black:]
They don't fuck with me even if they could
Pull out the stick, hit a bitch with the wood
First to park Rolls Royce, 'vert in the hood
Don't worry about us, over here we good
The AP Roman numeral, everywhere I go, I need pharmaceuticals
I ran my whole conglomerate, I was just mappin' shit out in the cubicle
Suicide coupe was a funeral, Trackhawk launch like a slingshot
Big ol' ruby diamond on my pinky finger, that bitch look like a Ring Pop
Money on my mind, money on your head
Can't ride three times while you comin' through the 'jects
Red Cross kept a nigga fed
In the studio with K. Dot fresh out the feds
Yeah, you niggas can't stand the rain, you niggas don't stand a chance
Yeah, Chevrolet candy paint, I spin the bend in the Benz
I caught a bale off a Google app
I'm the type to get my shooter whacked
I had to survive off a tuna pack
Five percent tint on the whip like, "Who was that?"
Coupe take off like it's mad
Beat the dope with a fork, I'm whippin' up Sudafed, I'm doin' scams in the lab
Every Thursday, girl's day, spendin' time with my daughter, make me go harder
Every Sunday's son's day, teach my boy to be a man, I ain't had no father
Fell in the love with the block, I ain't have no pop, just a sawed-off shotgun, Mossberg
We stackin' that money up proper, awkward diamonds, look like marbles
Audemars water, aqua, beatin' the block up 'til we spot 'em

[Eckhart Tolle:]
If you derive your sense of identity from being a victim. Let's say, bad things were done to you when you were a child. And you develop a sense of self that is based on the bad things that happened to you.

[Baby Keem:]
You ever seen your mama strung out while you studied division?
Your uncle ever stole from you, day after Christmas?
Seen both of those in the county jail visits
The first and the fifteenth, the only religion
Noodles in the microwave, shark tank tidal wave
Grandma shootin' niggas, blood on the highway
Crosses on the dashboard, you just want a platform
I wanna take everything that I ask for
Catch me a body, I'll put that on anybody but my mama
She showin' a pattern for certain
I think it's white panties and minimal condoms
My uncle would tell me the shit in the movies could only be magic
This year, I did forty-three shows and took it all home to buy him a casket
Jack of all trades, got money out the way
Put my heart in the faith, I'm good, love
Cousin in the courts, heard he jumped off the porch
Turn a brick to a Porsche, I'm good, love
Catch us, you know I'm gon' rack up
I need the advance and the equity to match up
The engineer dead if the drive don't back up
These words come of God, you could never outrap us
Nowadays, gotta walk cautious, ayy
Nowadays, I'm a new prophet, ayy
Game dead, no autopsy, ayy
City girl with they new hobby, ayy
Catch a body, put the Prada in the ta-da
Nigga 'boutta get some pussy, give me five (Give me five)
Gun dirty, got the thirty in the purse, purse
Tight bitch, put a perky in her salad
I gotta pray for the basic
I never seen my niggas bust down faces
Them niggas not tasteless
I only had one chance, I ain't even waste it
Been down on my luck
Been down on my luck when I fa-a-all
I gotta get up
I gotta get back up and ba-a-a-all
R-I-P, under my people
I'm proud of my people, I'm proud of my dawgs
My ex got a beamer, she want me to see it
I still ain't gon' see it, like, okay
I love when they ratchet, I don't do her Patek
I still do the watches the old way
She think I'm conceited, I'm thinkin' 'bout cheatin'
I don't do the flowers or roleplay
Now, how can I fold lookin' at twenty million
This money don't come with a probate
Mama, I said it'd be okay

I got this shit brackin' in four days
Four eyes, four eyes, two eyes
Switch sides, nigga be fresh out
Suicide doors, I suicide, suicide
Lambo body, who gon' stop me?
Baby Keem is too wild
Function at the temple
Jesus pieces in the luau
Mr. Morale


Kendrick made you think about it, but he is not your savior
Cole made you feel empowered, but he is not your savior
Future said, "Get a money counter," but he is not your savior
'Bron made you give his flowers, but he is not your savior
He is not your savior

Mr. Morale, give me high-five
Two times center codefendant judging my life
Back pedaler, what they say? You do the cha-cha
I'ma stand on it, 6'5" from 5'5"
Fun fact, I ain't taking shit back
Like it when they pro-Black, but I'm more Kodak Black
Tell me where the money at, ayy, where the homies at?
Universal callout, I can members only that, ayy
Si-si, wait a minute
Ven aquí (Ven aquí), c'est la vie (C'est la vie)
I tell the whole truth from A to Z, ayy
Show me you real, show me that you bleed, ayy
Hello? Crackers? (Let me hear that back)
I seen niggas arguing about who's blacker
Even blacked out screens and called it solidarity (Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck)
Meditating in silence made you wanna tell on me (Fuck)

Bitch, are you happy for me?
Really, are you happy for me?
Smile in my face, but are you happy for me?
Yeah, I'm out the way, are you happy for me?
Bitch, are you happy for me?
Really, are you happy for me?
Smile in my face, but are you happy for me?
Yeah, I'm out the way, are you happy for me? (High up)

Bite they tongues in rap lyrics
Scared to be crucified about a song, but they won't admit it
Politically correct is how you keep an opinion
Niggas is tight-lipped, fuck who dare to be different
Seen a Christian say the vaccine mark of the beast
Then he caught COVID and prayed to Pfizer for relief
Then I caught COVID and started to question Kyrie
Will I stay organic or hurt in this bed for two weeks? (You really wanna know?)
Do you want peace? (How I get so low?)
Then watch us in the street (Only one way to go)
One protest for you (High up)
Three-sixty-five for me (You really wanna know?)
Vladimir making nightmares (How I get so low?)
But that's how we all think (Only one way to go)
The collective conscious (High up)
Calamities on repeat, huh

Bitch, are you happy for me?
Really, are you happy for me?
Smile in my face, but are you happy for me?
Yeah, I'm out the way, are you happy for me?
Bitch, are you happy for me?
Really, are you happy for me?
Smile in my face, but are you happy for me?
Yeah, I'm out the way, are you happy for me?

Truth, it resides in the fire
The need of it's dire
Deceiving the lies, I know
Truth, it resides in the fire
The need of it's dire
Deceiving the lies, I know

The cat is out the bag, I am not your savior
I find it just as difficult to love thy neighbors
Especially when people got ambiguous favors
But they hearts not in it, see, everything's for the paper
The struggle for the right side of history
Independent thought is like an eternal enemy
Capitalists posing as compassionates be offending me
Yeah, suck my dick with authenticity
Yeah, Tupac dead, gotta think for yourself
Yeah, heroes looking for the villains to help
I never been sophisticated, saving face
Being manipulative, such an acquired taste
I rubbed elbows with people that was for the people
They all greedy, I don't care for no public speaking
And they like to wonder where I've been
Protecting my soul in the valley of silence


Heart plays in ways the mind can't figure out
Heart plays in ways the mind can't—
Heart plays in ways the mind can't figure out
This is how we conceptualize human beings

My auntie is a man now
I think I'm old enough to understand now
Drinking Paul Masson with her hat turned backwards
Motorola pager, off-white Guess jacket
Blue Air Max's, gold chains, and curl kits
'93 Nissan wax job, the earliest
Big social, big personality, vocal
Played the underground verbatim and stayed local
My auntie is a man now
I watch him and his girl hold their hands down
Tip of the avenues under street lights made his
Thinking, "I want me a bad bitch when I get big"
They hug on the corner like California king
Cold hand all up her skirt, cars whistling down the road
See, my auntie is a man now, slight bravado
Scratching the likes from lotto
Hoping that she pull up tomorrow
So I can hang out in the front seat
Six by nines keeping the music up under me
My auntie is a man now
Asked my momma why my uncles don't like him that much
And at the parties why they always wanna fight him that much
She said, "Ain't no tellin'
Niggas always been jealous because he had more women
More money and more attention made more envy
Calling him anything but broke was less offending"

My auntie is a man now
I think I'm old enough to understand now
Drinking Paul Masson with her hat turned backwards
Back when it was comedic relief to say, "Faggot"
Faggot, faggot, faggot, we ain't know no better
Elementary kids with no filter, however
My auntie became a man and I took pride in it
She wasn't gay, she ate pussy, and that was the difference
That's what I told my friends in second grade
She picking me up from school, they stare at her in the face
They couldn't comprehend what I grew accustomed
We pull off bumpin' Quik like it was nothing
My auntie is a man now, what a relationship
I grew up fast, I needed no one to babysit
He gave me some cash then gave me some game
Cherry freshener on the dash, I never complained
She even cut my hair at the pad, was loving my fade
The first person I seen write a rap
That's when my life had changed
House full of demo, smoke stuck on the window
Cameras on the microphone, all women and men though
My auntie was a man now, we cool with it
The history had trickled down and made us ign'ant
My favorite cousin said he's returning the favor
And following my auntie with the same behavior

Demetrius is Mary-Ann now
He's more confident to live his plan now (Talking to the world's gonna bring you down)
But the family in disbelief this time (Talking to the world's gonna bring you down)
Convincing themselves, "He ain't living discreet, he's fine" (Talking to the world's gonna bring you down)
They said they never seen it in him, but I seen it (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
The Barbie dolls played off reflection of Venus (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
He built a wall so tall you couldn't climb over
He didn't laugh as hard when the kids start joking (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
"Faggot, faggot, faggot," we ain't know no better
Middle school kids with no filter, however
I had to be very mindful of my good cousin
I knew exactly who he was, but I still loved him
Demetrius is Mary-Ann now
I mean he's really Mary-Ann, even took things further
Changed his gender before Bruce Jenner was certain
Living his truth even if it meant see a surgeon
We didn't talk for a while, he seemed more distant
Wasn't comfortable around me, everything was offensive
But I recall we both had a sick sense of humor
Made raw, but time changes all

Demetrius is Mary-Ann now
Remember church, Easter Sunday?
I sat in the pew, you had stronger faith
More spiritual when these dudes were living life straight
Which I found ironic 'cause the pastor didn't see him the same
He said my cousin was going through some things
He promised the world we living in was an act on abomination
And Demetrius was to blame
I knew you was conflicted by the feelings of preacherman
Wondering if God still call you a decent man
Still you found the courage to be subservient just to anoint
Until he singled you out to prove his point, saying
"Demetrius is Mary-Ann now
Church, his auntie is a man now," it hurt
You the most 'cause your belief was close to his words
Forcing me to stand now
I said, "Mr. Preacherman, should we love thy neighbor?
The laws of the land or the heart, what's greater?
I recognize the study she was taught since birth
But that don't justify the feelings that my cousin preserved"
The building was thinking out loud, bad angel
That's when you looked at me and smiled, said, "Thank you"
The day I chose humanity over religion
The family got closer, it was all forgiven
I said them F-bombs, I ain't know any better
Mistakenly, I ain't think that you'd know any different
See, I was taught words was nothing more than a sound
If ever they was pronounced without any intentions
The very second you challenged the shit I was kicking
Reminded me about a show I did out the city
That time I brung a fan on stage to rap
But disapproved the word that she couldn't say with me
You said, "Kendrick, ain't no room for contradiction
To truly understand love, switch position
'Faggot, faggot, faggot,' we can say it together
But only if you let a white girl say 'Nigga'"


It was one of the worst performances I've seen in my life
I couldn't sleep last night because I felt this shit–
Ooh, ah, ooh, ah
Ooh, ah, ah, ooh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yee

Enoch, your father's just detoxed, my callin' is right on time
Transformation, I must had a thousand lives
And like three thousand wives
You should know that I'm slightly off
Fightin' off demons that been outside
Better known as myself, I'm a demigod
Every thought is creative, sometimes I'm afraid of my open mind

Shit on my mind, and it's heavy
Tell you in pieces 'cause it's way too heavy
My diamonds, the choker is heavy
More life to give on demand, are you ready?
Who keep 'em honest like us?
Who in alignment like us?
Who gotta heal 'em all? Us (Us)
When there's no one to call

Don't need no conversation
If it ain't 'bout the business, shut the door now
Bitch, it's a celebration
And if this shit ain't bussin', what's it for now?

Steppin' out when the weight lifts
Floatin' on 'em (Ooh-ooh-ooh, da-da)
Floatin' on 'em (Float, float, ooh-ooh-ooh, da-da)
Floatin' on 'em (Float, float, ooh-ooh-ooh, da-da)
Floatin' on 'em (Float, ooh-ooh-ooh, da-da)
Steppin' out when the weight lifts
Floatin' on 'em (Ooh-ooh-ooh, da-da)
Floatin' on 'em (Float, float, ooh-ooh-ooh, da-da)
Floatin' on 'em (Float, float, ooh-ooh-ooh, da-da)
Floatin' on 'em (Float, float, ooh-ooh-ooh, da-da)

Uzzi, your father's in deep meditation
My spirit's awakened, my brain is asleep
I got a new temperature
Sharpenin' multiple swords in the faith I believe
I think about Robert Kelly
If he weren't molested, I wonder if life'd fail him
I wonder if Oprah found closure
The way that she postered the hurt that a woman carries
My mother abused young
Like all of the mothers back where we from
SSI bury family members
At the repass, they servin' Popeyes chicken
What you know about Black trauma?
F&Ns, kickin' back is another genre
Tyler Perry, the face of a thousand rappers
Using violence to cover what really happen
I know somebody's listenin'
Past life regressions to know my conditions
It's based off experience
Karma for karma, my habits insensitive
Watchin' my cousin struggle with addiction
Then watchin' her firstborn make a million
And both of them off the grid for forgiveness
I'm sacrificin' myself to start the healin' and...

Shit on my mind and it's heavy
Tell you in pieces 'cause it's way too heavy
My diamonds, the choker is heavy
More life to give on demand, are you ready
Who keep 'em honest like us?
Who in alignment like us?
Who gotta heal 'em all? Us (Us)
When there's no one to call us (Us)

Say, "Hydrate, it's time to heal"
Safe, you're frustrated, I can feel
Huddle up, tie the flag, call the troops, holla back
Huddle up, tie the flag, call the troops, holla back
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, da-da)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, da-da)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, da-da)
People get taken over by this pain-body (Ooh-ooh-ooh, da-da)
Because this energy field (Ooh-ooh-ooh, da-da) that almost has a life of its own (Ooh-ooh-ooh, da-da)
It needs to (Ooh-ooh-ooh, da-da), periodically, feed on more unhappiness


I'm sensitive, I feel everything, I feel everybody
One man standin' on two words, heal everybody
Transformation, then reciprocation, karma must return
Heal myself, secrets that I hide, buried in these words
Death threats, ego must die, but I let it purge
Pacify, broken pieces of me, it was all a blur
Mother cried, put they hands on her, it was family ties
I heard it all, I should've grabbed a gun, but I was only five
I still feel it weighin' on my heart, my first tough decision
In the shadows clingin' to my soul as my only critic
Where's my faith? Told you I was Christian, but just not today
I transformed, prayin' to the trees, God is taking shape
My mother's mother followed me for years in her afterlife
Starin' at me on back of some buses, I wake up at night
Loved her dearly, traded in my tears for a Range Rover
Transformation, you ain't felt grief 'til you felt it sober

I wish I was somebody
Anybody but myself
Ooh, I wish I was somebody
Anybody but myself

I remember lookin' in the mirror knowin' I was gifted
Only child, me for seven years, everything for Christmas
Family ties, they accused my cousin, "Did he touch you, Kendrick?"
Never lied, but no one believed me when I said "He didn't"
Frozen moments, still holdin' on it, hard to trust myself
I started rhymin', copin' mechanisms to lift up myself
Talked to my lawyer, told me not to be so hard on myself
He has an aura, I hope to achieve, if I find some help
Congratulations, made it to be famous, still I feel uneasy
Water watchin', live my life in nature, only thing relieves me
Spirit guide whisper in my ear, tell me that she sees me
"Did he touch you?" I said "No" again, still they didn't believe me
Mother's brother said he got revenge for my mother's face
Black and blue, the image of my queen that I can't erase
'Til this day can't look her in the eyes, pain is takin' over
Blame myself, you never felt guilt 'til you felt it sober

I wish I was somebody
Anybody but myself
Ooh, I wish I was somebody
Anybody but myself

I was never high, I was never drunk, never out my mind
I need control, they handed me some smoke, but still I declined
I did it sober sittin' with myself, I went through all emotions
No dependents, except for one, let me bring you closer
Intoxicated, there's a lustful nature that I failed to mention
Insecurities that I project, sleepin' with other women
Whitney's hurt, the purest soul I know, I found her in the kitchen
Askin' God, "Where did I lose myself? And can it be forgiven?"
Broke me down, she looked me in my eyes, "Is there an addiction?"
I said "No," but this time I lied, I knew that I can't fix it
Pure soul, even in her pain, know she cared for me
Gave me a number, said she recommended some therapy
I asked my momma why she didn't believe me when I told her "No"
I never knew she was violated in Chicago, I'm sympathetic
Told me that she feared it happened to me, for my protection
Though it never happened, she wouldn't agree
Now I'm affected, twenty years later trauma has resurfaced
Amplified as I write this song, I shiver 'cause I'm nervous
I was five, questioning myself, 'lone for many years
Nothing's wrong, just results on how them questions made me feel
I made it home, seven years of tour, chasin' manhood
But Whitney's gone, by time you hear this song, she did all she could
All those women gave me superpowers, what I thought I lacked
I pray our children don't inherit me and feelings I attract
A conversation not bein' addressed in Black families
The devastation, hauntin' generations and humanity
They raped our mothers, then they raped our sisters
Then they made us watch, then made us rape each other
Psychotic torture between our lives we ain't recovered
Still livin' as victims in the public eyes who pledge allegiance
Every other brother has been compromised
I know the secrets, every other rapper sexually abused
I see 'em daily buryin' they pain in chains and tattoos
So listen close before you start to pass judgement on how he move
Learn how he cope, whenever his uncle had to walk him from school
His anger grows deep in misogyny
This is post-traumatic Black families and a sodomy, today is still active
So I set free myself from all the guilt that I thought I made
So I set free my mother all the hurt that she titled shame
So I set free my cousin, chaotic for my mother's pain
I hope Hykeem made you proud 'cause you ain't die in vain
So I set free the power of Whitney, may she heal us all
So I set free our children, may good karma keep them with God
So I set free the hearts filled with hatred, keep our bodies sacred
As I set free all you abusers, this is transformation

I wish I was somebody
Anybody but myself
Ooh, I wish I was somebody
Anybody but myself

You did it, I'm proud of you
You broke a generational curse
Say "Thank you, dad"
Thank you, daddy, thank you, mommy, thank you, brother
Mr. Morale

Before I go in fast asleep, love me for me
I bare my soul and now we're free


I choose me

The pressure's taking over me, it's beginning to loom
Better if I spare your feelings and tell you the truth
Lately, I redirected my point of view
You won't grow waitin' on me
I can't live in the Matrix, huh
Rather fall short of your graces, huh
This time I won't trade places, huh
Not about who's right, who's wrong, huh
Evolve, the only thing known, huh
Ask me when I'm coming home, huh
Blink twice again, I'm gone

I choose me, I'm sorry
I choose me, I'm sorry
I choose me, I'm sorry
I choose me, I'm sorry
I choose me, I'm sorry
I choose me, I'm sorry

She woke up in the morning for the daily news
I was so low and mourning through the family feuds
Baby, I told you a story and laid down all the rules
Still, you won't grow waiting on me

I choose me, I'm sorry
I choose me, I'm sorry
I choose me, I'm sorry
I choose me, I'm sorry
I choose me, I'm sorry
I choose me, I'm sorry

'Cause all of it's toxic
Girl, I'm not relevant to givin' on profit
Personal gain off my pain, it's nonsense
Darlin', my demons is off the leash for a moshpit
Baby, I just had a baby, you know she need me
Workin' on myself, the counselin' is not easy
Don't you point a finger, just to point a finger
'Cause critical thinkin' is a deal-breaker
Faith in one man is a ship sinking
Do yourself a favor and get a mirror that mirror grievance
Then point it at me so the reflection can mirror freedom
She told me that she need me the most, I didn't believe her
She even called me names on the post, the world can see it
Jokes and gaslightin'
Mad at me 'cause she didn't get my vote, she say I'm triflin'
Disregardin' the way that I cope with my own vices
Maybe it's time to break it off
Run away from the culture to follow my heart

I realized, true love's not savin' face
But unconditional
When will you let me go?
I trust you'll find independence
If not, then all is forgiven
Sorry I didn't save the world, my friend
I was too busy buildin' mine again

I choose me, I'm sorry
I choose me, I'm sorry
I choose me, I'm sorry
I choose me, I'm sorry
I choose me, I'm sorry
I choose me, I'm sorry
I choose me, I'm sorry
I choose me, I'm sorry
I choose me, I'm sorry
I choose me, I'm sorry


[Kendrick Lamar:]
Said I'm a fuckin' monster, a massive attack, I haunt ya
I mastered the rap, then fucked up the monitors, mastered that
After that, I went for thermometers, popped 'em all, then popped in the
Jaw of Tracy Veronica, holler back, they promised us
No pajamas, insomnia, will attack, I attack like piranha does
Hit your block like a comet. Blah! And you all know what time it is
2012, mark your calendars, calisthenics and silencers
Exercisin' that trigger strap, rock with us, Metallica
Competition no talent, hmm, in the jungle, what's wild enough?
Just might stumble upon a pack of lions
No lyin', my soldiers dyin', this is Iraq, alliances
Lining with stars and bars of a prison rep, my science a-
-pplyin' pressure, her stretcher is needed, pay the proceeds
Or you live in debt, y'all soft as a giga-pet, you niggas can't see me
Unless you watchin' the TV or ultra huggin' my silhouette
My flow got the ceiling wet, I spit 'til I feel my breath
Who sinkin' my fuckin' chest? She fuckin' the fuckin' best
Mean my dick is the dick of death, mean I'm killing that pussy
Like Spike whenever that Jerry slept

Yeah, Dre
Me and Andre the Giant, 6'7 and climbin'
Whether you storm to your climate, whether you're beat makin' or rhyming
Bumping some Phyllis Hyman, hand full of diamonds like Jay fans
On a island with Ray Bans, glasses palmin' asses
That probably came wit' a great tan, he he
I be the motherfuckin' mecca of this hub city spectrum
Where they at? I will dissect them like a fucking frog's rectum
Why you wreckin' with irreputable? My worst flow incredible
They probably call the federal after I slaughter several
Etcetera, etcetera, Bentley passin' up Celicas
They tellin' us about shit, HiiiPoWeR in your mouth, bitch
And Top Dawg can vouch, bitch, nigga, what you 'bout?
About face with army outfits, the general's here
That mean the hustlers and the criminals here
Penitence reachin' pinnacles of life and despair
And me I solemnly swear to handle mine like a Taliban and die for it
Only difference is I ain't never askin' Allah for it
Only difference is I be spazzin' and still a proud poet
Put me in a category, I don't know what's a sadder story
Guts and glory, your pain bore me you ain't really lived it
I take you to a block where they crippin'
Or Piru that 5'2 gun bigger than the torso of Pippen
Bitch, I been doin' it
Before you niggas ruined it, show me somethin' different
You either kissin' dick or givin' me distance
You live in a district of dime bags and dummies, I know your statistics
Who your boss? He more like my assistant
Get lost, have a egg and a biscuit
Break fast when we aimin' them biscuits
Pay cash when your chain come up missin'
Q! Q!

[ScHoolboy Q:]
Ah!
Double up, shit, what the fuck?
Get me some my promo poppin', setbacks droppin', soon they watchin'
I just lock and load explode, target flowed, I'm somewhere blowed
Marriotts and Swisher Sweets, L.A. nigga pro'bly east
Cheerin' for the ragin' beats, X O Henny scrape the keif
Banging C, I'm bangin', B, put them niggas next to me
Stop and focus, get the lead, I'm here now, let the hardest speak
Ya all them dudes got ovaries, period, run on sentence
Still I'm ventin', air conditionin', coolest breezes, ill diseases
Grip my penis, shoot my semen, still I'm comin', miles a runnin'
I was learnin' gettin' knowledge, head is throbbin', she's a goblin
We be mobbin' over bitches, stick and miss and she the business
Get a witness, pussy frenchin', just a mission
Poppin' off like on a mission, proposition, gettin' money, drop a nigga
Rush a nigga, stomp a nigga, crush a nigga, dust a nigga
Copperhead gon' thrust a nigga, heatin' up the winter, nigga
Somethin' to remember, nigga, hella sick, I got a spit
Curse with a verse like God told me kill the shit
Load the clip Heckler & Koch, the hoover king
Bada bing by the ding a ling, natural hoover
Fing ring with a vision clearin' it with Visine, Asian from Beijing
Money make her cum, she cream- feed the weak, that's Wing Stop
At the start with rain drops, autobot
Space shuttle shittin' on your car lots- boy, stop!
Could at least got a Saturn, huh? HiiiPoWer see our patent, huh?
Workin' on tracks like we never been free, 22 squeeze niggas shootin' off Cs
Please thought a nigga shot 16s
Rhyme sixteens- bada bing, bing, bing, bing.... bing

[Kendrick Lamar:]
If you want to be from HiiiPoWeR
Please come to friend zone
But don't wowwy
You will not suck on my dick tonight


[Kendrick Lamar:]
Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt)
I know the feeling haunt you (Haunt)

[SZA:]
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Tell me what you gon' do to me
Confrontation ain't nothin' new to me
You can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue
But you can't bring the truth to me
Fuck you and all your expectations
I don't even want your congratulations
I recognize your false confidence
And calculated promises all in your conversation
I hate people that feel entitled
Look at me crazy 'cause I ain't invite you
Oh, you important?
You the moral to the story? You endorsin'?
Motherfucker, I don't even like you
Corrupted man's heart with a gift
That's how you find out who you dealin' with
A small percentage who I'm buildin' with
I want the credit if I'm losin' or I'm winnin'
On my mamma, that's the realest shit

Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt)
I know the feeling haunt you (Haunt)

[SZA:]
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer

It's getting cold when an ego gets to talkin'
I get involved, like a rebound
No control, no, I'm switched in the way that you bringin' me down
It's a turn on, you didn't wait from me
Leave me alone, keep away from me

And it sounds wrong, get it away from me, yeah
I just cry for no reason
I just pray for no reason
I just think for the life, for the days
For the hours and another like breathin'

I did it all 'cause it feel good
You'd leave it all if it feel bad
Better live your life, we were runnin' out of time

[Kendrick Lamar & SZA:]
Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?

This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer

All the stars are closer
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know

[Tame Impala:]
Only go backwards, lately
Every part of me says, "Go ahead"
I got my hopes up again, oh, no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards, darling

[Kendrick Lamar:]
And we'll be screamin' out, "No rules! No rules!"
Feel the energy we go through, I told you
Pump my fist like I'm supposed to, I showed you
My vision of the unsocial is so cool
Look around me and you'll see the scene, who to blame?
See my generation has no shame, I play the game
How I see it. This is inside the future, this is nothin' that you're used to
I refuse to play the victim, my religion is to move you
Out your power position, my army head-on collision
Can't harm me out of my own skin. Government need assistance
Every time that I zone in. Nothing is more convincin'
Than tellin' you that I won't bend, break or fake partition
I can't. This is my life design. This is me taking mines
This is what I live for. This is me takin' yours
This is more than C4. This is what happens when
We're ready to build and destroy
I hope that you enjoy

[Tame Impala:]
It feels like I only go backwards, lately
Every part of me says, "Go ahead."
I got my hopes up again, oh, no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards, darling

[Kendrick Lamar:]
I live my life a rebel, a vigilante. Devils try to get at me
Pedal through this underworld. Undertakers won't catch me
System ain't no system for justice if you would axe me
I'll tell you everything is corrupted. Don't you walk past me
With the condescended look I can tell you're pretendin'
Like you, my friends, and you're just a henchman. I feel relentless
I feel the tension in the air thick enough to cut through it
Or cut you with it. I'm cut from a cloth that bred a nuisance
Trespass on your property. I am properly aimin' to go against your democracy
This is me changing faces 'cause I can stand alone and die alone as long as I got pride
The victory of fight is all in my eyes
The night is young, and I can see your demise. I'm waitin' for it
You can't ignore it, you live dormant, I die enormous
Big as the lies you tell I can tell that you feel defeated
The truth will set you free and to me that's the only reason, capisce?

[Tame Impala:]
It feels like I only go backwards, lately
Every part of me says, "Go ahead."
I got my hopes up again, oh, no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards, darling
It feels


Man, Beyoncé, I'm mad at you
Man

They say, "Hello" (Ayy), "Hello" (Ayy)
I can daydream about Beyoncé all day
Thinkin' 'bout the good times 'fore she met Jay
See ya know
They say, "Hello" (Ayy), "Hello" (Ayy)
I really thought I had a chance to be your man
Until I seen the video with the ring on your hand
It hurt me so

I remember you were sixteen on the TV screen with Wyclef
Were you my type? Oh God, yes, I was impressed
You was like "No, no, no," I was like 12 years old
Hoping that one day I could chaperone while you were on the road
You wore braids with a bangin' body
Look like you did Pilates, a lot of sit-ups probably
But bump that, I was there from the start
Even when Latoya Luckett and that other doo-doo bucket broke your heart
Hope you didn't cry cause honestly they were just so-so
They couldn't sing anyway, you deserve to go solo
No disrespect to Kelly and Michelle, I'm just sayin' they cool
But you? You are somethin' like Wonder Woman
And I just wanna hold your hand, bring you to Compton
Gonzales Park, we can build castles in the sand
Eatin' hot Cheetos with pickle juice in it
Put that napkin down, you know I'll lick your fingers when you're finished

They say, "Hello" (Ayy), "Hello" (Ayy)
I can daydream about Beyoncé all day
Thinkin' 'bout the good times 'fore she met Jay
See ya know
They say, "Hello" (Ayy), "Hello" (Ayy)
I really thought I had a chance to be your man
Until I seen the video with the ring on your hand
It hurt me so

I just bought the Sasha Fierce CD
Gazed at the cover for a whole 5 minutes, 'til my girlfriend hit me
She jealous of you, 'cause I don't love her like I love you
I even make her do the "uh-oh, uh-oh," just like you do
She tell me I'm obsessed, I tell her we connect
Like Ice Cube way before the Mac 10 feud
She's like, "You goddamn fool, that girl's rich and you're broke"
I said, "So? I'm only 500 mil' away, there's still hope"
Anyway, I had feelings even way before you got paid
And I didn't laugh when you bust your ass on the stage
And I salute Kanye for takin' up for you
I would've stole the award just to prove that I love you
But Jay should've did that I thought he had your biz-ack
What happened, Mr. Izzo? Hopico? Fredrico?
He used to be my favorite 'til he abandoned my diva
Now I tell everybody, Nas had killed him on "Ether"

They say, "Hello" (Ayy), "Hello" (Ayy)
I can daydream about Beyoncé all day
Thinkin' 'bout the good times 'fore she met Jay
See ya know
They say, "Hello" (Ayy), "Hello" (Ayy)
Hopefully, I still have a chance
Maybe if I sabotage your man
You never know, hm

I'ma sneak backstage at a Mary J Blige concert
With an "I love Mary" shirt, then find Jay-Z
And push him into a dancer, hopefully, they lock lips
That's when I yell out, "Sounwave, hurry up take the pic!"
Put it on Bossip the same night, yeah, that sound quite right
Publicity like that? Yep, they'd be sure to fight
Better yet, I'ma steal her cell, then call up Affion
He impersonates Jay well, get Beyoncé on the line
Then make up some bogus shit, like, "You don't rub the back of my knees right
So this marriage is over with
And the ring that's on my finger? Guess what? I'm throwin' it!
Cling, you heard the sound, so you know I did"
Ha ha that should get 'em
That should break em up like a Kit Kat when I do that, yeah, true that
I'ma put the plan in motion, that's for sure
But if I end up with Macy Gray, this plan never work

Yee, man, I hope Jay don't be mad at me 'bout this song
Start-ay, Wizzle start me back from like the first verse
Like right before I come in
Ha ha, what you say? Nah, you think it'll be hot, for real though?
Nigga, you stupid, they probably laughin' as hard as you
Nigga got the best wife in the world and shit
Run that back, though


[Kendrick Lamar:]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch, don't kill my vibe; bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe; bitch, don't kill my vibe

Look inside of my soul
And you can find gold and maybe get rich
Hol' up
Trinidad Jame$ in four weeks
But now my album platinum and shit, so what?
Y'all keep the numbers
I'm more than another statistic, my nigga
This courtesy of Compton (Courtesy of Compton)
Brooklyn go hard, motherfucker
Love me on the East like I'm Chuck D
Dominicans wish that I was born there
I'm lookin' to be the god MC
You look at my hat and see thorns there
I look at the game and see porn there
I'm fuckin' this industry hard
I'm bagging this money, tea-bagging your honey
You thought I was fresh out the yard
Don't cry to me dummy, you're a lightweight
They tell me you nice and I'm like "wait"
Go get me a knife, you're looking like steak
And when the stakes are high, I stake out for days
And when the water reside, you're Bobby Boucher
But we ain't thirsty nigga, never alert me, nigga
I got a P89 in a suitcase
I know you heard me, nigga, this is a burpee, nigga
Lyrical exercise, right now, homie, I'm in the extra vibe
Pipe down, on the curb, when you heard that I got these words
To the upper echelon, that's excellent (That's excellent)

I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch, don't kill my vibe; bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe; bitch, don't kill my vibe

[Jay-Z:]
Up in the clouds, me and my spouse
Rumors on the ground gettin' too loud
Please turn them shits down, can't hear myself think
Turbulence, shit, almost spilled my drink
In the White House with a mink
Running through that bitch like it's my house
All up in the hall like a mall
Told you motherfuckers, all I do is ball
No, I don't 'member you, I don't intend to
Empty my memory bank
It's a million dollars in it, baby, Hilary Swank
Sittin' next to Hillary smellin' like dank
Presidential pardon, name one nigga out there harder than him
I'll wait
I've been in my wave like 20 years straight
I've been on my vibe like 20 years straight
Don't fuck up my high, fuck up my high
Nights like this, I could fuck up a pie
An still be straight (still be straight)
Fall back, bitch, I got a lot on my plate
Don't waste my breath
I don't know how many moons a nigga got left
Back to this joint, smokin' this shit like I'm tryna' prove a point
I'm the highest, the highest title, numero uno
Kill my vibe, that's your motherfuckin' funeral

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Between you and me, turn eulogy to urinals, niggas pissed off
I ministered this generation by far
Leader of the new school
On my toes like a ballerina, who knew I'd be Black Swan?
World in my palms, ironically
I am the Globetrotters' best 'cause I didn't drop the ball
Told niggas when I was 16
That I'd write a 16 to put a nigga right on the big screen
In the paddy wagon with six teens
Should have been in the pen
But now my pen write with morphine
I heal niggas, touch down with more fiends
I kill niggas, audio crack, khakis to meal ticket
Cardio lap, was running for dear life
But now I'm running the map, bitch, I'm here nigga
Picture lil' ole me giving a fuck for what a fuck nigga gotta say
Nigga, you never be Jay, never be Nas, never be Snoop nor Dre
You ain't get killed in Vegas or in a Suburban
Nigga, Puff Daddy wasn't your favorite
So many washed up with detergent
But I don't dry tears, I just aim at them on purpose
Like blah, Mini-14 like blah
Empty out another magazine like blah
Let a young nigga get by (Doot!)
I kill 'em all when they try to kill my vibe (Doot! Doot!)
I am the bad, the good god, the last the hood got
The last that would try to pass a good job
If Shawn's a black Beatle then I need a 10 second drum solo
Bitch see you at Woodstock, ah!


Dick hard like rottweiler
Can you handle it? Can you handle it? Woo woo, woo woo

The whole industry been in shambles
Everybody fugazi, I'm just changing the channel
Kendrick Lamar, the people's champion, I'm animal for analysts
Career damaging verses, meditating with candles lit
I like my raps extra prolific
Since free-styling on lunch tables and park benches
And I won't mention my ten thousand hours in training
While juggling, gang-banging, my balancing was tremendous
And now we look at the competition as quick submission
They tappin' out before we even get a chance to miss 'em
What this about, is it money or skill?
Maybe it's both and I got large amounts of it, it's real
You see my oath is very unbreakable, my style is never mistakable
I can see y'all incapable
To be the God MC, you know me well
Ridiculous, venomous, hate in my heart, the sinister
Run for cover, my lineage prove itself
I'm rollin' deep in that paper like two Adeles
Before scholars, I flowed tighter than virgin lips
We here to shake the game up and you're flying through turbulence
Everything is high stakes nowadays, that's how it played nowadays
It's like an 8-ball to the face nowadays
I'm laced nowadays, my gun is off the waist nowadays
It's seven figures and retainer for the case nowadays, I'm talking
Higher power, every other hour since Eddie Bauer
Since stash boxes and lead showers, breaking the padlock
And the dead coward dying a thousand deaths, entire lion
Surround itself with bears, watch it nigga, you share a profit, ah!
This is what they want, I'm the one
This is vintage from nineteen-eighty-somethin'
I'm the son of the pioneer that got you near the sun
Play with him, bitch you better off voting for Donald Trump
I'm yelling Mr. Kanye West for president
He probably let me get some head inside the residence
I'm in the White House going all out
Bumping College Dropout, God bless Americans
Nothing more influential than rap music
I merge jazz fusion with the trap music
I mix black soul with some rock and roll
They never box me in, I'm David Blaine-ing all you hoes
Oh yea, let's go there, my DNA is DMT, I'm so rare
My Juvenile was wilder than the Nolia
A locomotive couldn't track me down in my career
Runnin' this shit with four pair, son of my bitch, I might demolish
A bitch right in front ya, chico, what have you done here?
D-Bo, all of it one year, Mississippi to California
It gets annoying, niggas wanna deplore him
And bitches wanna adore him, but industry shit ain't for him
Probably thinking it's for him, only one me
Swallowed the key and kicking the door in, never leasing my foreign
Mr. Valevictorian studied the game before them
Listen to you with boredom, baby rappers, abort them
To the grave I deport them, corporations extort them
I'm snapping off my endorphins, I alien mighty morphin'
My radiance rather gorgeous, hundred bill to the doorman
Hundred mil' in my fortune, they call me back in the morning
You're racing against the tortoise, pace myself it's important
Lace myself with the wisdom my playerism enormous
So pay the man for performance, saucy all of my garments
Jimi Kendrix performing, this fucking studio haunted (Ah!)
I tell a bitch don't sweat me (Don't sweat me)

I kill this whole fuckin' beat if Cole let me (Please Cole)
Ib should've never sent the instrumental
Every time I start writing I get sentimental
This shit is just not fair
But why the fuck should I care?
The story of your life here
Two young stars was born and y'all gon' die here
Oh Lord, gotta be the yams
Billboard list need 2Pac, damn
But number 9 makes sure he lives on, yeah
Hoochie, coochie, pussies in a trance
Every day a celebration, but even the valley peaking me
Is not validation, nigga this TDE
And my doggies be salivating, salaries, better ratings
And casualties all around me, don't make me do demonstrations
Whoa
Murder my allegations and burning my finger traces
Adjourning my power patience and earning royalty payments
I'm sorry y'all not relating, this party is reservated

I kill this whole mutherfucking beat if J. Cole say it
My nigga Ib chopped the instrumental, I gotta slay it

I gotta lay it, gotta show you fuckers I'm not to play with
The ruckus had been my favorite, King Kunta the fuckin' greatest
Whoa
Burnin' my leather-
(Nah I'm just fuckin' with you)


I wanna hit line drives
Wanna lose weight and keep eating
For you
Hey. What's up, doc?

Now I was raised in a sandbox next to you and her
You was holding the handgun, she was giving birth
To a baby boy to be just like you, I-I wonder what's that worth
I-I wonder if you ever knew that you was a role model to me first
The next day I-I woke up in the morning, seen you on the news
Looked in the mirror, then realized that I-I-I had something to prove
You told me, "Don't be like me, just finish watching cartoons"
Which is funny now 'cause all I see is Wile E. Coyotes in the room

And I run it, blow blow blow blow
And I run it, blow blow blow blow
And I run it, blow blow blow blow
And I run it, yeah blow
And I run it, yeah blow

That's ironic (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
Ironic (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
That's ironic (Y Yeah! Blow!)
Ironic (Yeah! Blow! Yeah!)

[Gunplay:]
Salt all in my wounds
Hear my tears all in my tunes
Let my life loose in this booth
Just for you, motherfucker, hope y'all amused

And I run it, blow blow blow blow
And I run it, blow blow blow blow
And I run it, yeah blow
And I run it, yeah blow

That's ironic

...situation
Liberation...leader
Popular pie plant pictured here
Wile E. Coyote! Wile E. Coyote!

[Kendrick Lamar:]
This shit make a nigga just wanna write
Reminisce when I had the morning appetite
Apple Jacks, and after that I hit the TV Guide
Animaniac the only thing that gave me peace of mind
I'm a maniac when aiming at the enemy that lied
Tell a story that I'll never grow to 25
Not to worry, every warrior will come and see euphoria
And that's a covenant I put on every tribe
Ain't nobody gon' tie your shoe
Nobody gon' abide by (by) your rule
Nobody holding your gun, how come, your tongue say "killer" then kill my mood?
Light-speed living in the world you know
Little old me feeling like a live wire
Bet I put some new tires on a lightening bolt
'Til I wreck into a pole, like a right to vote
I am from the bottom of the jungle
Living in the bottom of the food chain
When you get a new chain, nigga take it from you
A new name, want stripes, and you a zebra look alike
Hope another homicide don't numb you a nun
Do things we'll never learn soon
In the era where we wanna earn soon
That's a error, you can smell it in the air
Everybody really doomed
That's why I'm backdooring you motherfuckers
All ya'll can suck my dick
All them days at the county building
I'm 'bout to make my momma rich
Cartoons and (cereal)
I ain't felt this (good since)
Scrooge McDuck (here we go)
Elementary hood shit

Now I was raised in a sandbox next to you and her
You was holding the handgun, she was giving birth
To a baby boy to be just like you, I-I wonder what's that worth
I-I wonder if you ever knew that you was a role model to me first
The next day I-I woke up in the morning, seen you on the news
Looked in the mirror, then realized that I-I-I had something to prove

That's ironic (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
Ironic (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
That's ironic (Y-yeah! Blow!)
Ironic (Yeah! Blow! Yeah!)

[Gunplay:]
Salt all in my wounds
Hear my tears all in my tunes
Let my life loose in this booth
Just for you, motherfucker, hope y'all amused

And I run it, blow blow blow blow
And I run it, blow blow blow blow
And I run it, yeah blow
And I run it, yeah blow

That's ironic

[Kendrick Lamar:]
This shit make a nigga just wanna shit on everybody
Even with a pot to piss in
I'm 'a aim sloppy at a loud mouth, discharge
Dismiss any business of yours
Discounts never did amount to a check
That ya ass couldn't cash when the shit bounce
Everything dismounts, niggas gon' flip that car
AKs for the whole hood
House lick went down perfect
Two shots to the head he deserved it
Overheard it hit my bed with a bowl and remote control
Darkwing Duck, lost service
Mama said I'd better duck, she's nervous
Drama all up in the cut, hit the curtains
I mean don't intervene with no gun machine
This block stay jerking, the feds stay lurkin'
Emerging on everybody corner (dash for it)
Get a toe tag, when you play tag with a task of a new (task force)
Everybody wanna know my life
How did I make it (past yours)
Well let me tell you like this
I've been running this shit since (I asked for it)
Cartoons and cereal

Now I was raised in a sandbox next to you and her
You was holding the handgun, she was giving birth
To a baby boy to be just like you, I-I wonder what's that worth
I-I wonder if you ever knew that you was a role model to me first
The next day I-I woke up in the morning, seen you on the news
Looked in the mirror, then realized that I-I-I had something to prove
You told me, "Don't be like me, just finish watching cartoons"
Which is funny now 'cause all I see is Wile E. Coyotes in the room

And I run it

[Gunplay:]
Salt all in my wounds
Hear my tears all in my tunes
Let my life loose in this booth just for you
Motherfucker hope y'all amused!
I did wrong, karma came
Crackers gave me ball and chain
Friends, enemies all the same
State, fed, both can hang
Nobody can mute me, but I never said nobody can't shoot me
Just another stat to the white folks
Still whip work to the white yolk, absolutely!
Everyday feel like the one before
Hunt the money, don't hunt the ho
If you do what you always done
Then you get what you always got
You dumb buffoons!
I ain't seen the back of my eyelids
For about the past 72 hours
Hand on my heart, face to the hood
I pledge every word you ever heard was honest
Yeah this me, no mic
No cameras, no lights, just pain
Mama how much trauma can I sustain?
Dirty money come with lots of stains
Road to riches come with lots of lanes
Just another player with lots of game
Never had shit got lots to gain
Just another player with lots of game
Never had shit got lots to gain

Just another player with lots of game
Never had shit got lots to gain

(To be continued)


When the sun fall out the sky
All I have is me in the land of do or die
A freeway, a gas pedal, and a peace of mind
Now, that's the ultimate high
To the cloud I go, cloud I go
One time, baby tell me ya need me
Cloud I go, cloud I go
Two time, baby tell me ya love me

'Cause I've been drinking too much, thinking too much
We ain't been keeping in touch
Fell into lust, where is the love?
My independency got tendencies of lack of trust
I look at the street corners as my new woman
Seductive as she want to be, hands all on my garments
And luckily, being in denial ain't the case
'Cause I know she's unfaithful
Instead I'm grabbing her waist
And every part of her is tasteful
I know you're feelings hating
In fact, you think I'm ungrateful I know
Selfish as I wanna be and every time you under me
I get the vibe you might need some time to grow

When the sun fall out the sky
All I have is me in the land of do or die
A freeway, a gas pedal, and a peace of mind
Now, that's the ultimate high
To the cloud I go, cloud I go
One time, baby tell me ya need me
Cloud I go, cloud I go
Two time, baby tell me ya love me

'Cause I been drinking too much, thinking too much
We ain't been keeping in touch
And every time that I think of your touch
Adrenaline pump, give me that rush
I'm going like a thief inside the wind
Lord forgive me for my sins
I know she want me more, but I fiend for Benjamins
She said I found the root of all evil
And lost a friend
Lost in the world of a young boy from Compton
That never knew love because love was never promised
I know selfish as I wanna be
And every time I'm under you, me too
Need time to grow

When the sun fall out the sky
All I have is me in the land of do or die
A freeway, a gas pedal, and a peace of mind
Now, that's the ultimate high
To the cloud I go, cloud I go
One time, baby tell me ya need me
Cloud I go, cloud I go
Two time, baby tell me ya love me


His eyes bloodshot red
I watched him as he took a fifth of Henny to the head in memory of his brother
Reminiscin' on them playing Sega with each other
He was hurtin', I could see it, plenty tears, no Kleenex
I stood by his side because that was my homie
Gave him a hug, some of his brother's blood got on me
Clinchin' his fist on some angry shit
Stood up, sat back down on the curb and asked me who they be hangin' with
I wasn't sure, so I gave him no answer
But I was sure that he had him a blammer and wanted war
Revenge, what do you say to a good friend
That just lost it and grabbin' choppers out of the closet?
I tried my best to make him re-neg
But he was like, "My nig, this feelin' is more than personal."
I stood down
He hopped in a four-door Honda Accord
Before he bent the block, he said, "K-Dot
...You wouldn't understand."

(These streets can turn a kid to killer in minutes
Not by choice, but forced to be a menace
Can someone just pray for me, oh woe)
Or, at least, try to understand
(The city pressure
The AK-47, twin MAC-11s
The Desert Eagle shotty and the Smith & Wessons
Pray for me, oh woe)

Corners become monuments for the dead
Candles on the pavement, postcard read
Rest in peace, the yellow tape blockin' off the streets
A baby mama yellin' at the police
But you don't understand
You figure that we're just a bunch of niggas but the picture here's a story untold
See, this wasn't in our plans
Babies from the late eighties wasn't born crazy, we was raised that way
Put that Malcolm X book down, then raise that K
Complete chaos when we off X pills and St. Ides
Look the devil in the face, from a sane eye
Cast the spell on you like Akeelah and the Bee
Every killer in the street is a teen with a corrupted mind
Substance, time, is no longer an issue
We don't have it, so pass the tissue
Then close the casket, kiss the momma when you can
And tell her you understand, but you don't understand

(These streets can turn a kid to killer in minutes
Not by choice, but forced to be a menace
Can someone just pray for me, oh woe)
And, hopefully, you'll understand
(The city pressure
The AK-47, twin MAC-11s
The Desert Eagle shotty and the Smith & Wessons
Pray for me, oh woe)

He came back fifteen minutes later
He said, "Dot, I went on one, do me this favor
Dump these guns in a safe place, let nobody see you
This as critical as it gets, my nigga, I need you."
I said, "Alright, so what happened?"
"Seen a few niggas slippin' and I just started clappin'
I didn't care who I was hittin'."
That's wild shit, but anyway, I got you
I love you nigga make sure you hit me up by tomorrow
I woke up the next mornin' with a cold
Allergies got me sneezin' and wipin' my nose when it was leaking
Checked the medicine cabinet, lookin' for some DayQuil
But all I seen was some Aspirin, s'just my luck
I got up, went to Rite-Aid
Hopin' that the pharmacy department had the right aid
I bought it and left
Walked to the parking lot, that's when I seen the faces of death
Said they was lookin' for my man, with a chopper in their hand
Prayin' it would jam, but you don't understand

(These streets can turn a kid to killer in minutes
Not by choice, but forced to be a menace
Can someone just pray for me, oh woe)
I'm tellin' you, do you understand?
(The city pressure
The AK-47, twin MAC-11s)
Huh? Do you understand?
(The Desert Eagle shotty and the Smith & Wessons
Pray for me, oh woe)

It's like
It's a revolving door
That I've been a part of
My whole life
Fucked up, right?


Abazaba

You know we get in the studio and do what we do best
You know
Beautiful shit
But this time around I wanna do something different homeboy
You feel me my nig
Hop on them keys real quick my nig

Play some shit that my girlfriend'll like
I ain't tryna entertain these other hoes tonight
Play some shit that my girlfriend'll like
Yea ha ha ha yea
This shit my girlfriend'll like
I ain't tryna entertain these other hoes tonight
I'm playing shit that my girlfriend'll like

Check me out
She say she love it when it sounds like this
She tell me Kendrick put it down like this
When I listen I wanna close my eyes
And feel your lips
Let your lyrics wrap around me and grab my hips
So enticing
On point like the helmet of a viking
Kicking up dust like I'm hiking
I ain't calling a woman a bitch on this one
I be calling my woman so I could get some
She fresh off work and Lord knows it was hard
She take off her shirt and Lord knows that I'm hard
Composing myself, tryna remain content
She had a long day and plus I know she wanna vent
Now she could talk about her boss and I can give advice
Or she could take the panties off and I could eat the pie, pie
Fuck that, option number deuce
On the kitchen table while I play this tune
You know why?

This shit my girlfriend'll like
I ain't tryna entertain these other hoes tonight
I'm playing shit my girlfriend'll like
Ha ha ha yea
This shit my girlfriend'll like
I ain't tryna entertain these other hoes tonight
Aba, this shit my girlfriend'll like my nigga

Look

We be in the car, bumpin' my latest jam
I recorded at the studio around 10 PM
It's a club banger
Catchy hooks and 808s
I even threw a bridge on it just to play it safe
The first eight bars, she's lovin' the track
Even rewinding it back
Soon as the beat drop
The way she react she like, "That's hot."
'Til I start talkin' 'bout how many hoes I got
How many I fucked
How many I've misled just to get a nut
Like a squirrel, in pursuit of lunch
Uh
Though I'm on some cliché rapper shit
I know she thinking are my lyrics that accurate
She's so cool doe
Don't downplay her just to fuck up the mood yo
She'll still play it even though I sound rude yo
And disregards to the provocative records
One thing that I do know

This something my girlfriend'll like
I ain't tryna entertain them other hoes tonight
I'm playing something that my girlfriend'll like
Told you that my girlfriend'll like
Other hoes tonight
Soul

This something my girlfriend'll like too
Kendrick I got you

This a great idea
This'll be my girlfriend's joint right here
So I'mma kick the shit she like
It seem right
Like a pair of jeans that fit tight
Around her cute booty
I like to hold her from behind in line
At the movies
Her body language gets read
Like a ruby
'Cause she a work-a-art
No help from Julie
I'mma beast and she such a beauty
I love her, she know that, I place no one above her
Far from an arc, but best undercover
Kodak moment every time we in sync
Like a iPod plugged to a USB
It's just you and me
I mean me and her
I mean her and I
It's plain to see, affirmative
So if you ever need me
You know where Herbert is
On her mind
Like she on mine
Uh
Play some shit my girlfriend'll like
'Cause I ain't tryna entertain them other hoes tonight
She do music too, this shit my girlfriend'll write
If she was me talking 'bout her
DJ

Play some shit that my girlfriend'll like
I ain't tryna entertain them other hoes tonight
I wrote some shit that my girlfriend'll like
Now I'm sure to get some cuddy


And this is for the homies
I'm talking 'bout the swap meets, Rollie
Chain-wearing niggas with the white tee
Baby tell the truth, yeah you know we

Somebody get ready to pass me the hit of that endo, I'm tryna get blown
I'm tryna get turned up like the fifteens in my Cadillac Brougham
Looking for E.T. to phone home
Tadow, the flavor I kick reminisce the good days
Thinking back when we used to run in the swap meet for the Rollie chains
Pro Club T-shirts, whiter than Anglo-Saxons
Make it a 1X-Tall, crispy with the cotton fashion
That's fashion if you come where I'm from
Compton California, one love to the murder capital under the sun
Young niggas running around the street with heat bigger than me
But I don't trip, I still dip like salsa to a chip
Rolling down Rosecrans to scoop up my man, A-Mack
He talking about some foolishness on how we can pick up on some hoes, believe that
And so I scooped him 'round 3:30, telling me it's all good
Tiger Woods, now we looking for the birdy birdies
Stopped at the sto' to get some rubbers
Pulled up on the breezies. Well what do you know? I think they love us

And this is for the homies
I'm talking 'bout the swap meets, Rollie
Chain-wearing niggas with the white tee
Baby tell the truth, yeah you know we got it going on
And if you feel good (hey)
Raise your hands high and throw up your hood (hey)
Represent the city like you know you should (hey)
I want to make sure that you understood we got it going on
(Is that right? Is that right?) We got it going on
(Is that right? Is that right?) We got it going on
(Is that right? Is that right?) We got it going on
(Is that right? Is that right?) We got it going on

As I continue my day, quite copacetic
Headed to my mamma's house to see what them greens are talking 'bout, hungry as hell
Had the right grub, I bail, need some gas
ARCO station on Avalon, a relative hit me up as he rolled past
We used to stand in line for Jordans, excited we got 'em
Rocking platinum FUBU jeans with rubber bands tied to the bottom
Throwback jerseys, Chamberlain and James Worthy was two of my favorites
I might pull out the green Larry Bird on special occasions
But anyway I'm steady coasting, smoking on that Hiroshima
Ashtray got a million roaches, I'm focused but feeling good
The homies hanging on [?] and Monte Carlos
Impalas and Tahoes, shoot something nigga, break that fifty
I'm grabbing the city like I'm supposed to
Making my presence felt like Christmas day, what can I say?
Every vocal is spoken with the wisdom of a G
If you can't relate then please have a seat

And this is for the homies
I'm talking 'bout the swap meets, Rollie
Chain-wearing niggas with the white tee
Baby tell the truth, yeah you know we got it going on
And if you feel good (hey)
Raise your hands high and throw up your hood (hey)
Represent the city like you know you should (hey)
I want to make sure that you understood we got it going on
(Is that right? Is that right?) We got it going on
(Is that right? Is that right?) We got it going on
(Is that right? Is that right?) We got it going on
(Is that right? Is that right?) We got it going on

So, wherever you located, won't you let it be known
And put on for the soil of which you was grown
I put on like brand new Chuck Taylors
While giving you cuts like fresh tapers
I'm such a fool with it, go nuts
You bullshitting like Tuck, the bounce then untuck
The bounce then throw up, a rare jewel, you duck
Take 'em to school I must, this for the cool in us
This ain't for you, so what?!

And this is for the homies
I'm talking 'bout the swap meets, Rollie
Chain-wearing niggas with the white tee
Baby tell the truth, yeah you know we got it going on
And if you feel good (hey)
Raise your hands high and throw up your hood (hey)
Represent the city like you know you should (hey)
I want to make sure that you understood we got it going on
(Is that right? Is that right?) We got it going on
(Is that right? Is that right?) We got it going on
(Is that right? Is that right?) We got it going on
(Is that right? Is that right?) We got it going on


Yeah. How I sound out there Ali? Good? Then good

Can I pay my past a visit?
Centennial Compton School District
And video campus shut the fuck up your premises
King Drew and Westchester had the baddest bitches
And my nigga L Wood had a white Toyota, and we got pulled over
Had to hide the bottle because there was mix with Hennessy and soda
Every time we rode up we was unsober
And everybody had know that
My nigga Yan Yan had all the red P Hat
Which was really dumb because where we was at
Was the other side and more than likely
The other side really didn't like that
Didn't have no burner so if they shot us we could never really shoot back
Could've lost our life over hood rats
We was dumb as fuck but lucky for us we was lucky enough
That the black car didn't pull up and ask where y'all niggas from
I know some, nigga less fortunate was fucking with the enemies' bitch
She had a fat ass and a brown Camaro but it wasn't that fast it was like a V6
But anyways she was one of those hoes in high school with the cornrows
Size 5 Jordans, Rolex sporting, and wanna fight everybody she knows
Well she's important, well she wasn't, she was just so and so so and so cousin
He was a red, so anytime she got into it, that who she would get
Now let me get back to the plan
Homie had ask, "Do ya got a man?"
She said, "No". He said, "Oh yeah
Where do you stay?" She said, "Rosecrans"
Rosecrans and what? She said, "Don't matter just know I fuck."
He said, "What? You're a—you're a little freaky bitch. Huh?"
She said, "Yeah daddy I can get you sprung
I can work that pussy and the tongue
If you come over I can make you cum
If you come over make sure that you bring drink
Because I like to get to drunk."
And that he did, that Friday he was where she lived
Notice that he was out of bounds
But didn't give a fuck 'cause he wanted to fuck that bitch right now
Walked in the house, rubber on, panties down
Oldies playing in the background
Let's get it on Marvin Gaye had bumped to the morning
Time to go, picked his pants up off the floor
Kissed that bitch in the mouth then walked to the door
When he walked out he seen a four four Bluh!
Didn't know that was the pussy he was dealing with

And that's how you get your ass killed bitch!
That's how you get your ass killed bitch!
That's how you get your ass killed bitch!
Get your ass killed bitch! How?
Fucking with them hoes, them hoes, them hoes, them hoes
Them hoes hoes, them scandalous hoes
Them hoes hoes will have you uh dead dead dead

Look. I guess we all can learn from mistakes
But your first mistake, might be your death date
And death doesn't wait on no one
A million ways to die, and you can make it a million and one
If you not aware of the rules or maybe tryna fill someone else's shoes
Like a square trying to be a gangster kind of remind of this one dude
He wasn't thirteen he was twenty two
When he went to first get put on the hood
He wasn't born it, Boys in the Hood the movie made him think it was all good
But usually this type of person want to prove his self on purpose
Tell everybody quit working, but really he's worthless
His mamma had money, his daddy had money, so he had money
The OGs that gave him a pistol, think that he was gonna be just another crash dummy
And the funny thing about it he thought he was 'bout it like P-Miller
But he wasn't no killer
Just a monkey hanging around a bunch of gorillas
Everybody wanna be tough guy so he did, approached this guy like, "Where are you from?" with his gun but didn't shoot it, rule number one
Never pull out if you don't use it
Even though the dude didn't banged the very next day he seen around the way blew his brains out while homeboy was cruising
Not knowing the scariest nigga will split your shit

And that's how he got his ass killed bitch!
That's how he got his ass killed bitch!
That's how he got his ass killed bitch!
Fuck around and get your ass killed bitch! How?
Not knowing the G codes, the codes the codes
The G codes, the codes the codes
The G codes, if you don't know then your already dead dead dead
Feel me?


When I jumped off the porch
I was forced into last resorts of a temper gone short
And, of course, when that took its course
I was hoarse from yelling out
Demons that fought inside of me taught society how to rejoice
The killers on sight of me, privacy obviously was lost
And the fraud piracy of the streets in my odyssey
Caught a bullet that probably destroyed
A good kid in a mad city, slightly annoyed
I walked down the street with no heat
And run into beef when I'm just a vegan
Reekin' the scent of a saint, sinner smell it then start squeezing
Pellets that's tumblin' straight at my melon, apparent reason
Probably was because of my cousin cuzzin' a blood
That was bloodin' in public
And Kendrick seen with him last weekend, cousin
But you ain't no kin to me, 'stead of Kendrick, I'm Kennedy
Assassinate my character, sure that's your remedy
Fair enough, I got enemies but I don't bang
But that's the repercussions like
When your cousin is cuzzin' a blood
Then you're by yourself at the Compton parade, he said:

Aye, look, homie, I gang-bang (Pump, pump)
A gang member, I'm active, I do my thing (Pump)
I do my stuff (Pump)
I'm really from the sect, tho (Pump, pump)
And if you is or ain't, I still need to know

Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay
Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay
Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay

I seen 'em from afar then I seen a piece of my jaw
Like on the ground, you know the sound
When you hear the people in awe
Sympathetic 'cause they like seeing you
Tryna fight back at a pack of piranhas
I promised three of 'em, beat the black off my back
And pajamas was almost needed
I should've went to sleep and seen some sheep
When I greeted the pavement
Got up and seen the shock on their faces
Like "Damn it. He made it."
My luck in the palm of a cherry bomb
And they waitin' to blow up on me
My homies are not alarmed
Then I heard someone's firearm
Make a sound like it waved around my direction
I'm guessing this is the part where my heart
Expected to drop in a second, look at the faults
I've made in the shortest amount of time
And in back of my mind I'm like "This the loss I'ma take."
My fate was distraught
A cape and some superpowers can't save me
I'm probably pushing up daisies
Before I can make my way to the car
Cross cancel and right before I seen
The black glove raisin' the handle, he said:

Aye, look, homie, I gang-bang (Pump, pump)
A gang member, I'm active, I do my thing (Pump)
I do my stuff (Pump)
I'm really from the sect, tho (Pump, pump)
And if you is or ain't, I still need to know

Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay
Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay
Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay

Bitch, I'm bustin' back, I'ma borrow my uncle's strap in a minute
Jump in a Civic then wear that bitch on my lap
I was timid but now I'm tempted
And tenants alert me on where you at
I'm a menace when I'm offended, relentless, I will react
Then somebody said the dispatch
Of an officer, got his mind made on off'n ya
That's a fact when you're black and undeveloped
You're profiled as a felon
I'm bailin' down Boulevards with my basketball and a backpack
Gym shoes and my nap sack
Hair nappy, my ball cap backwards
And then I look back, strobe lights on my tail pipe
Turned left then I turned right
Turned deaf 'cause the sirens is loud
As the colors of pink and yellow on Wesley Snipes
Pray to God I don't get sniped
Pray to God that the sunlight stay shining for 30 more minutes
Hope that a witness around when I'm 'bout to cut off the engine
Vengeance of hatred is what I'm facin'
Even though being a criminal ain't my memo
But this is what he said when I dropped the window:

Aye, look, homie, I gang-bang
By the time you hear the next shot, you'll learn that L.A.P.D. is the biggest gang (Pump)
I do my stuff (Pump)
I'm really from the sect, tho (Pump, pump)
And if you is or ain't, I still need to know

Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay
Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay
Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay


[Kendrick Lamar:]

Poppin' wheelies on the freeway, I'm a stuntman
Got the city goin' crazy, look at what you done man
We just havin' fun man, T-O-P the gun man
D-O-T was on his level, vibin' in the function

Starin' at a dead president, they be talkin' to me, but look
I'm the type that get sassy on a bitch
One thing I can't stand is a messy lil' bitch
And a lotta y'all niggas undercover male groupies
105 with the window down, bumpin' Fugees

[Baby Keem (Kendrick Lamar):]
Doing what I want, yeah, I'm filthy

(Put respect up on my name, ho, I'm heavy in this bitch, yeah)
Handsome, say she wanna fuck me 'cause I'm handsome

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Big chillin' with my foolies and we all cool

You ain't countin' money, checkin' chicken, man, that's awful
And I got a car full of them female fossils
Lil' baby actin' fool with it, take a jaw full
I be drippin' sauce too, I done took a loss too

Ain't nothin' to a full-time player on the deep end

Handsome, say she wanna fuck me 'cause I'm handsome


[Kendrick Lamar:]
It was eye witnessing poverty
Burning bullets allowing these walls breaking
Devour these laws trying to empower me
I thought I knew the reason you grew to love sour diesel
Smoking like locomotive your focus was hourly
And then you caught me your pity party had towered me
Shower me with the will that never dried
I tell you put your worries and friendly doubts to the side
I doubt that you listen, it's stuck in your system I tried
She's been miserable, she's been living in prison
Soaking up life's reality this is the visual
Baby daddy a light build blade walking with high heel
Paid stalking that avenue, never knew how the light feel, I
Got a plan got a plan for ya
I just just might hold a couple bands for ya
And leave this message in the sand for ya
Tell me you're ready to change
She said naw nigga it's part of the game
Just like heroin

[Lance Skiiiwalker:]
Streets don't fail me now need you right on time
Say, right on time
Please stay paced and the ground need you right on time
Say, you right on time
Streets don't fail me now need you right on time
Say, you right on time
God, please lift the smile need you right on time
Say, right on time

[SZA:]
Runaway from the fire, I fly downhill
Lay your head over this side, now
You keep pain on the inside, now
What's been eating you, who's been needing you
You been keeping it down, and
You been taking me higher and higher

[Punch:]
Functioning addict, I'm high off her passion
Chasing history's baddest, I mastered this apparatus
Rackin' my brain, I'm scared of being average
Going against the grain just tryna maintain my savage
Foolish of her to try to play towards my vanity
And foolish of me to let her do it, I love calamity
I love a challenge, naw I love the fantasy
And this is high stakes I risk it all for a pair of snakes
Connect the dot nigga this is fate
I'm talking predestination
I'm talking blind dedication
Plan B is contraception we didn't make it
Sexercise a little bit of patience
The love of the rush is us
I'm addicted to violence, helicopters, and sirens
Blood pressure is skying, nigga I'm trying
I never felt more alive than I felt dying
Heroin

[Lance Skiiiwalker & SZA:]
Streets don't fail me now need you right on time
Say, right on time
Please stay paced and ground need you right on time
Say, you right on time
Streets don't fail me now need you right on time
Say, you right on time
God please lift the smile need you right on time
Say, right on time

[Isaiah Rashad (SZA):]
I heard you spending all your time baby (oh)
And you could never get a dime baby (Never get a dime)
At least a nigga got a dime baby (At least a nigga got it)
It's hard to come home (Hard to come home)
It's hard to come home (Hard to come home baby)

[Jay Rock (Kendrick Lamar):]
She my gift and my curse, she really quenching my thirst
Baby my vice, she got me driving with no headlights (Is that right?)
She know my thoughts, pleasures and pain
Everybody love her and she love everybody the same

[Kendrick Lamar:]
She said I got a plan, got a plan for ya
I might hold a couple bands for ya
Leave a message in the sand for ya

[Jay Rock:]
Tell me you want me to change, hell naw I'm still sipping the same
Nigga it's just like heroin


Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits, but now I'm countin' this
Parmesan where my accountant lives; in fact, I'm downin' this
D'USSÉ with my boo bae tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy yo' ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris
A.M. to the P.M., P.M. to the A.M., funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
It's levels to it, you and I know

Bitch, be humble (hol' up, bitch)
(Hol' up, bitch)
(Hol' up, bitch)
(Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up)
Sit down (hol' up)
Be humble
Sit down (hol' up)
Be humble
Sit down (hol' up)
Be humble
Sit down (hol' up, hol' up, hol' up)

Who dat nigga thinkin' that he frontin' on Man-Man? (Man-Man)
Get the fuck off my stage, I'm the Sandman (Sandman)
Get the fuck off my dick, that ain't right
I make a play fucking up your whole life
I'm so fuckin' sick and tired of the Photoshop
Show me somethin' natural like afro on Richard Pryor
Show me somethin' natural like ass with some stretch marks
Still will take you down right on your mama's couch in Polo socks
Ayy, this shit way too crazy, ayy, you do not amaze me, ayy
I blew cool from AC, ayy, Obama just paged me, ayy
I don't fabricate it, ayy, most of y'all be fakin', ayy
I stay modest 'bout it, ayy, she elaborate it, ayy
This that Grey Poupon, that Evian, that TED Talk, ayy
Watch my soul speak, you let the meds talk, ayy
If I kill a nigga, it won't be the alcohol, ayy
I'm the realest nigga after all

Bitch, be humble (hol' up, bitch)
(Hol' up, bitch)
(Hol' up)
(Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up)
Sit down (hol' up)
Be humble
Sit down (hol' up)
Be humble
Sit down (hol' up, hol' up)
Be humble
Sit down (hol' up, hol'up, hol' up, hol' up)


September 22nd, 2009
Kendrick Lamar, to... to

Let me start off this letter saying I don't like you
Scared of you, but I will fight you
I stare at the ceiling and think about you
Curiosity killing me, thinking of when I'ma meet you
You introduced yourself to so many others, mothers, sisters and brothers
Children and babies, drive me crazy, I wonder
Why you love people that love people that do right?
Is it rocket science to you, or is it just your type?
One of my biggest fears
Is waking up four in the morning and gotta hear you met one of my peers
Or maybe a family member that you thought was cool
Or maybe a person that I'll never meet 'cause of you
You, son of a bitch, and I wish you never existed
And I swear I'd blow your brains out if you paid me a visit
But that's not realistic, 'cause you'll never rot
But I'ma still send this letter off, P.O. Box
And when you get it

Please take it personal
Please take it personal
Please take it personal
Because it's personal

Let me continue this letter saying I don't like you
I'm scared of you, but I will fight you
Should be ashamed of the moves you make
The pain you bring, the sorrow and the hearts you break
Every day you remind me that you're always there
'Cause every time I come around, someone's getting shot down
And all I say is a prayer, "So help me, Lord."
Then the Lord talk back, "I can't help you, boy."
That's fucked up, my life's fucked, was cursed before birth
And what's fucked up, I gotta live my life with the hurt
Of knowing that you're everlasting, dwelling upon the masses
Of the earth, fatal assassins snatching bodies
Probably, on my notepad as I write
Why the fuck you wanna take my life?
Sooner or later, I'm tired and weary and my gray hairs are not in my favor
So when I write on this paper, it's real talk, so

Please take it personal
Please take it personal
Please take it personal
Because it's personal

Let me start off this letter saying I don't like you too
And the reason we haven't met because I've been busy doing
Whatever since grade school I've watched your every move
You slipped up a few times
I gave you a pass, so don't say I ain't sympathetic
But you can barely get curiosity, I'ma dead it
Everybody wanna know why I act this way
Let's just say, I had a bad day
Matter fact everyday, but I take it out on somebody
And you could probably find me wherever the wolves parade
I was born to be a killjoy, I'm an old brat
Conceived by Adam and Eve, so who you mad at?
Not me, see me, I'm just doing my job
And you ducking me is mos def an odd
So why send this letter as if I never knew you?
I'd rather knock on your door and just hand it to you

It's everywhere, the streets, the corners
The coroners, the morgues
The cemeteries, hospitals
Heard about it when I was little
Tomorrow's not promised
'Cause any day can be knocking at your front door
War, genocide, homicide
Suicide, all coincide
Signed and sealed by the living
Make it, don't take it

Please take it personal
Please take it personal
Please take it personal
Because it's personal

So I can move different
I don't give a fuck if there ten billionaires right here, man, fuck that bitch

Might give it all away like Jack Dorsey
[?] and the babies don't need me
Buy more land 'cause we never had land
Trust me for blood, and my estate plans
I'ma keep it a buck, I'ma five-star brand
Killstreaks, 5 links, all plated gold
Isolation, justice in my soul

I can tell you what it is, I can tell you what it isn't
No more K. Dot, my mother had named me Kendrick
Fuck a stage name, that's the name that I was given
The only thing that I can identify within this business
I'm just a good kid from Compton that want to rap
Weighing my options, pick up a Bible or a strap?
I never killed a man, never sold any crack
All I ever did was try to keep my city on the map
But this monkey on my back, y'all don't want me to win
I'm tryna follow dreams, you want me to follow trends
So just to get a dollar, will I sell my soul?
I look the Devil in the eye and tell him, "Hell no"
They say anything worth having is worth the wait
Well, I want the world, tell me how long that takes
There's no time like now, I can cut my patience short
Or give 'em some more gowns, I don't even want the crown
I just want a peace of mind, and nigga, when I get it
You won't get a piece of mine, won't you mind your own business?
A rich nigga buy anything you sell him
A broke nigga believe anything that you tell him
Well I'm a broke nigga, but still I wouldn't listen to you
Even if your hand was on a Bible quote, nigga, pfttuh

See I was brought up different
Whatever that my pops said, for sure I'd listen
You said you did dirt, but I can't dig it
It don't concern you if you wasn't born in it
Oh-no-oh-oh
I swear we got to fast-forward, before time flies by
My new saying for '0-10 is, why lie?
And if you ain't trying to win, then why try?
Now you can low-ball or give me high five
This is I nigga, look into my eye

Nigga, I am Kendrick... Lamar
Nigga, my name is Kendrick... Lamar
I said my name is Kendrick... Lamar
I changed the name 'cause I was tired of being like y'all
Now finally I'm ready to tell the world who I are, pfttuh

And that used to be a hell of a task
Now I'm ahead of my class, so go ahead and harass
My character like it don't carry a confidence
That can marry a Halle Berry or Angelina with no cash
I'm 'bout to cash in my thoughts
Give you a compass, then tell you get lost
What I'm 'bout to accomplish is something that you can't fathom
Once the Eves come, they quick to stare at him
Hoping I don't take their bitch, but I'm on some other shit
When I'm done, I'm tryna run the government
These are big dreams, transition from a rapper to a human being
You can't 'school' a dean
I be tutoring artist-es, leave 'em with no audience
All 'cause they all a facade, my God
Y'all be out partying, I be stealing your audience
All because who I are, Lamar

But my first name, it gotta be Kendrick... Lamar
Nigga, my name is Kendrick... Lamar
I changed the name 'cause I was tired of being like y'all
Now finally I'm ready to tell the world who I are, now let's go

But we can't go... backwards


These streets is Jurassic, cowards get asthmatic
Astronauts hover throughout the atmosphere, that the ghetto burb
Pull up on the curb (what's up homie!), smoke a nigga then dip
It's the immaculate, verbal assassin, strangle your perfect etiquette to an accent
This is Jesus of Nazareth
Spittin' gold policies to a world unknown
In a cherry Low-Low with four zones of weed, no sticks no seeds
Prestigious when I post safe through fifty states, beneath the speed
Can corral the largest crowds, mosh pit with a big dick
Screaming bitches ain't shit, she gobble gobble for hours I jumped in the shower
I dismantle, devour, hardest MCs softer than Clam chowder
No challengers can compete, they're childish and weak, detrimental
Hazardous hazard to instrumentals, intertwined with God and Frankenstein
I'm kurupted!

I'm kurupted!

Gimme a hundred Gs for every MC I drop to their knees
Verbically useless, oh you got the Juice? I'll squeeze you juiceless
Catch you, hang you from many nooses
Been the truth since, Snoop and the pound was fuckin' over ruthless
Young and I'm ruthless, twenty-one with twenty-one guns, shottys that's looted from Pac, lyrical cyclops
Lazer-in 'em on paper and fraudulent friends, bitch you's a bitch in disguise and bitches get ten
Bullets to their midsection, Mr. Lethal injection in a regal higher than church steeples, I swear to god
Count your lyrics in a jar, I'm a pterodactyl tearin' ya squad, like pardon me in Terrance Martin in Aston Martin
Cannibal co-existing with the coldest, that means I'm the sickest, and Theraflu won't do
Whenever I'm kicking the wickedness, explosive, syntagmatic, smokin' like the barrel of this tech aimin' at ya' neck
I'm kurupted!

I'm kurupted!

(Look homie) I'm from C-O-MP-TO-aNy nigga can get it, the little homie strapped and he with it
At the Avalanche swap-meet (what's up fool!)
Blunt longer than Rosecrans, I'll grab the devil then slow dance
Practice trigonometry, practice my aim on rooftops eating pastrami sandwiches, you are counterfeit
Worthless beats and verses surfaced. West Coast with a big scope kill all Y'all It's Top Dawg, TDE, CPT
Quick to tell a bitch jump on my dick A.S.A.P
Complete havoc, compulsive disorder, rhyme addict -- Slaughter
House is full of Joey, Joells and Royces for ya'
Live from the area code of Three-One-Oh
Laughin' all the way to the bank with three Elmos
Three six-fos, one bottle of Goose, I'm the truth, you could put your hand on the bible and shoot
I'm Kurupted!

See a lot of y'all get real disrespectful, real comfortable, not recognizin' ya' legends
West Coast legends, Young Gotti

I black out like Howard University when I verbally turn into Hercules hurtin' these MCs early and urgently urkin' my nerves searching for certain certified nouns and verbs on the verge of vigorous victory. Kurupted


[Kendrick Lamar:]
Uh
Yeah
Kendrick Lamar
Uh
Yeah I can reconcile being depressed real bad
I'm a thinker not a drinker but still I Hennessey drag
Alcohol numbs the pain like where Novocaine stabs
In your arteries, pardon me but my city go mad
Via Compton California, corners with coroners and karma on 'em
Colours corresponding to gangs upon us
Common corrupted Crips and Pirus cripple the city
Triple the crime, Bible nor the Quran can save
Welcome, don't be afraid, your city similar right?
Where the choppers kidnap the night and police silence your rights
Stare at the sky, wonder will you live to see twenty-five?
I'm twenty-two, at twenty I knew I was against the odds
This kid named Jonathan was monitoring
His mamma and sister, his older cousin, he honoured him
Anonymous bodies on his burner was astonishing
To Johnny, he might've been
A modern day rider then
He walking outside again, he see the lifestyle of an active member
Pull out a MAC-11 now his eyes is big
Fascinated by mayhem, what's his cousin to say now?
He wanna be from the hood that he's from and that's one
More gangster under the family tree, took 'em under his wings like KFC
Crip crazy, rocking matching T-shirts that says "The hood made me"
No love, just spread slugs, that's the policy, the leader and the prodigy
Now shorty doo-wop, holding a oowop, hanging with rah-rahs
With blah-blahs that sit on the block catching fades hittin' licks
Going on missions with lunatics, a ninth-grade menace
Thugging for six months, smoking like six blunts an hour
The power of banging, he was walking from...(gunshots)
Little Johnny

[Malcolm X (Kendrick Lamar):]
I think you'll find, sir, that there will come a time
When black people wake up and become intellectually independent enough
To think for themselves as other humans are intellectually independent enough to think for themselves
Then the black man will think like a black man and he will feel for other black people
And this new thinking and feeling will 'cause black people to stick together
And then at that point you will have a situation
Where when you attack one black man, you are attacking all black men
And this type of black thinking will 'cause all black people to stick together
And this type of thinking also will bring an end to the brutality inflicted upon black people by (black people)
And it is the only thing that will bring an end to it
No federal court, state court or city court will bring an end to it
It's something that the black man has to bring an end to


Wow
I think I must have forgot or something
Like I ain't hot or something
Like I don't make your girl take off her top or something

I'm like
Ha ha ha ha
LMAO
Ha ha ha ha

Laugh at the haters in here
I'll be her favorite in years
She wanna play play
But, what more can I say say?

Jump in the coupe and I'm gone
I smell like money, I don't need no cologne
I just need me a freak
That can jump on the bone
Like an X-Ray technician
My rectangular prism
Says money sex then drugs
All 'cause I'm 21
Like playing blackjack
Picture this Kodak
Moment forever
K.Dot that dude
She sucked my dick and got frostbite
I'm that cool

I got a pocket full of checks
Plus I'm bouncing through the club
With a crazy two-step
And diamonds on my neck
Ziploc fresh
Ziploc fresh
Hoes wanna play play
What more can I say say?

Bottle of Goose and I'm gone
Watching her get loose

The shit that we on
Is the ultimate high
Double XL flow
That's the ultimate vibe
Park that Lambi' outside
Just to fuck with the haters
Put the Lami' in drive
Watch 'em peel like potatoes
Holla' LMAO
When they drunk and two-step
Like I never could pass
A sobriety test

I got a pocket full of checks
Plus I'm bouncing through the club
With a crazy two-step
And diamonds on my neck
Ziploc fresh

I'm in the club I can manage
Providing lenses
Make my view panoramic
I'm out of this world
I'm off of this planet
They don't say K.Dot is here
They say his spaceship has landed
And your access has been granted
Like a kitchen floor
But my floor is marble
I ride in the carpool because I got two whores
In the back of that chrome
See they're all I need
Like Aaliyah alone

I got a pocket full of checks
Plus I'm bouncing through the club
With a crazy two-step
And diamonds on my neck
Ziploc fresh

Hoes wanna play play

Uh, shout-out to ScHoolboy Q
He uglier than a motherfucker

Tire marks, tire marks
Finish line with the tire marks
When the relay starts I'm a runaway slave
Ugh, walking on water and running on waves
God MC, oh my God, you gotta see
There's never no I's in me
Of an odyssey, I'm a block away
Fire marshal's moving in
Marshmallows inside my pen
Sweet sixteens
Got a sweet sixteen and they deadlier than sin
I'm so appalled
With the prototype with a godly protocol
You an amateur, they wanna pro to call
I damage ya on camera, in Compton, in Canada
I don't care where ya are
Just blink twice and I'm there where you are
Like a shadow in the dark, you a paddle in the boat
In an ocean full of sharks 'bout to come up short
Water in the pot, flow crack rock like Bam Bam nigga
Have two grams nigga pay up or blam blam nigga
Had a black Camry, bumpin' Dipset, Killa Cam nigga
I had been around niggas, killers, pimps
You ain't been around shit but your mamma and your bitch
Shoved off the porch when I was like six
Uncle Bobby got the house raided back in 9-6
Kick in the door
K9s all in the kitchen way before I even heard of Mike Vick
Mamma in the bathroom poppa at work
Happened on Sunday we shoulda went to Church
Look at my shirt, Polo on it
It's gon' sell if my logo on it
I fear no opponent
A demon come near and I might throw a spear at the omen
You looking at the 2010 Romans'
Empire, Hiiipower HP, in ya face like HD
And I spit like a HK
I'ma shot like a H3, H-U-B-C-I-T-Y, A-B and Y-G
Problem and Hootie nigga
Tell the government come shoot me, nigga
'Cause I'm going out with a fist raised
And a fist full of money give it to the fifth grade
Drink a fifth of Hennessy and then take another fade
With a democratic politician from CA
They don't wanna see a B-L-A-C-K
Making some scratch like a hall of fame DJ
Give us some free J's put us in the PJs
Now we in the county jail calling for a three-way
Goddamn, y'all cold
Mark of the beast wear your goddamn barcode
Stuck in the street where it's dark like Harpo
Black man tell me where your goddamn heart go
Although I'm in the land of milk and honey
Nobody never gave me shit, when I got my first chain
All the niggas tried to take it from me
I had to fight back and shit
Take it back and shit
And you rap niggas looking funny tryna talk back and shit
Like he back that shit
Acting like you real or something
Nigga ain't popped no steel, ain't popped no collar
Go pop some pills or something
You trying real hard to appeal to someone
I'm being myself, my BFF is a BM-dub
With your BM in it and a stash box glove
And the medicine a doctor gave a nigga won't help
I'm at the limit where I be amazing myself
I bet I finish on a level with a Black belt
I bet I hit it where every rapper get killed, like
Bla bla bla bla where the knife at?
Cut cut cut where your life at?
Your career's over, he's slumped over
And if I'm off beat know I'm un-sober
That's a new flow
Pl-, Plus Q gave me some Kush and some Nuvo
New dough for the new year and I sumo on a rap peer
Not a rapper, I'm a raptor
That's a T-Rex in a V-neck for the rapture
I'm a factor and your facial
I'm a fracture to a fraction
No one-half and I hate math
Pastor's like Eddie Long, fucking maricon
Took me mighty long to get here
Nigga, fuck!

Told ya I was gonna fall off Q
We recording? You got that shit?
(Yeah, yeah) Ugly, our ugly ass
(Fuck all that, "Setbacks" dropping December)
Don't worry!

You are not gonna suck my dick tonight!


[Michael Jackson (Busta Rhymes):]
Just look over your shoulders, honey!
(Yeah, I know, it's been a minute)
Got to know
Just look over your shoulders, honey!
Whenever you need me
Just look over your shoulders!
Whenever you need me
Just look over your shoulders, honey!
When you need me. Woo oh!

[Kendrick Lamar:]
I wrote my first bars in the car with Stacy
How bizarre, my battle scars at large would lace me
Big marbles, nigga
I lead this new generation, boy, don't argue with us
Marvelous beat selectors, authors and novel spitters
And it's all for the literature
And it's all for the hideous, the nastiest flows, the chlamydia, uh
I ain't afraid to say I need you, ah yeah (Hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop)
I promise I'd never leave you, ah yeah
My life is like twelve open mics of hopeless notes I write
For sure my folks unite soon as the flow get nice, the poltergeist
That scare emcees, my prototype for every, my share of deeds
And RIPs, you know my type of style is like my everything
Apparently my appetite they famished, bite no hand that feed
The culture vulture die and bleed
My focus hold these thoughts and dreams
Control this pen (Look over your shoulder)
Boldest lines of rhymes and things
Devote my time and mind it seems
Supposed to shine, remind I'm king
Provoke the blind and bomb the fiends
The pros, the cons of diamond rings
I'm full of time but I'ma bring
The soul divine and cross between
What's yours and mines, the goal the green
The roads that show just what it mean
Then grab Shakur right by the wing
And fly before my vocals (Scream!)
For hip-hop, look at my Ziploc
Bag full of goodies, you Chris Rock, hit the Pookie and piss stops
Since tube socks, baby, you a hell of a drug
Just look over your shoulders when they fuck you over, it's love
I know ya

[Michael Jackson:]
(Woo!) Don't you know, baby?
Don't you know, baby?
Just look over your shoulders, honey!
Whenever you need me
Just look over your shoulders!
Whenever you need me
Just look over your shoulders, honey!
Yeah yeah, you need me (Woo!)

[Busta Rhymes:]
Shh, look over your shoulder, get me?
'Cause I done bodied the game to the point niggas scared to rap with me
Kept burnin' 'til they anointed me one of the kings of black history
And yes, I see the game is a little different, niggas lack simply
Them bars and I spit 'em like darts 'til they puncture your kidney
You trash and it don't matter how much you gon' try to convince me
And you gon' make my gun cock and talk a whole 'nother way, yo
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh (Woo!)
I am the Buddha, the Ali Baba, the believer-er maker
So pristine, the dice roll from under my sleeve when I shake 'em
So rude, I'm so ice cold but I'm what you need to just wake 'em
All them crowns and medals on the wall waitin' for me to just take 'em
When I arrive, my theme music got a pound to it
And when I leave, even my shadow got a sound to it
'Cause I'm the god of the harder, the martyr, the father
I spit a saliva that's leaking a lava
Completin' the saga while meetin' and greetin'
And beating you niggas completely and conquer
Extremely bark on a nigga, you see me
And deeply carve up a nigga, believe me
Graffiti your armor, you heebie, you jeebie
Bikini your braud up (You guinea pig!)
See me now give me the startup and treat me, you greet me
And meet me with arms up
So sweet when I speak, have a seat, it was deep
I was sleep, now the god's up, hmm
Upholding the fundamentals, while most of you boast a rental
Focus on what's most essential, spit bars to provoke your mental
Do I have your attendamiento?
While I clap these raps like thunders
Look over your shoulder boy and wonder

[Michael Jackson {Nikki Grier}:]
(Wooh!)
Don't you know, baby? {Ooh, whoa}
Don't you know, baby? {Mhm, mhn, yeah}
Just look over your shoulders, honey!
Whenever you need me {When you need me}
Just look over your shoulders!
Whenever you need me {Whenever you need me}
Just look over your shoulders, honey!
Yeah yeah, you need me (Woo oh!)

[Nikki Grier:]
With God watchin' over us and me over your shoulders (All you had to do is look forward)
But what you gonna do, you pull the devil even closer (Why'd you pull the devil even closer?)
Them clowns that you hang with more ridiculous than white Cleopatra
Or Caucasians telling blacks to go back to Africa
But I digress, you're more, but you act less
Why do you act less even still, when the weight of life feels like a boulder (Just look over your shoulders)
I'm here whenever you need me
When you need me
Whenever you need me, when you need me

[Michael Jackson:]
(Wooh!)
Don't you know, baby?
Don't you know, baby?
Just look over your shoulders, honey!
Whenever you need me
Just look over your shoulders!
Whenever you need me
Just look over shoulders, honey!
Yeah yeah, you need me (Wooh!)
(Wooh!)
Don't you know baby?
Don't you know baby?
Just look over your shoulders, honey!
Whenever you need me
Just look over your shoulders!
Whenever you need me
Just look over your shoulders, honey!
Don't you know, baby?
Don't you know, baby?
Just look over your shoulders, honey!
Whenever you need me

I stomp a rapper like a Kappa, beat him like a congo
Then speed off in a Bronco, O. J
Often reminisce about the old days, Hardaway/Alonzo
Back then, we was wearin' LA Gears with the rhinestones
Nowadays, I'm comin' headfirst like a rhino
I rhyme like I invented it, my wordplay is unlimited
Now nigga, spin my vinyl, club going ape shit
Rap like I ain't ate shit, shit on any A-list
Artist, you a novice, I'm recordin' on a spaceship
And we never nodded to your single, King K
D.O.T. is E.T.A. Primetime, new clothes
Close-minded niggas gettin' clothes-lined, I suppose
Bitch, I think I'm 2Pac, bitch, I think I'm B.I.G

That's appreciation tape, thanks for knowin' that I'm great
Middle finger to the fake... fuck you!

And my bitch a mutt too, mixed with all type of shit
Got the keys to her pad like I'm 'bout to type and shit
Got 'em all hype and shit, I ain't even do nothin'
Screamin' out "Fuck the world", tell you when I'm through nuttin'

Compton, Compton, nigga, I'm Compton
Big-ass condom, motherfuck ya mama!

I go inside the studio, a suicide bomber!
I bomb on Obama if that nigga get in my way
I'm smellin' some vagina, y'all niggas is clitoris
Must be already dead, sayin' I ain't killin' it
I'm in the lead and winnin' it, feelin' like a stunt double
I'm convinced we already in hell, pass the blunt, devil
Y'all talkin' "Illuminati", I'm talkin' eliminatin'
Everyone, includin' Satan, Lord knows heaven waiting
I'm the best rapper alive! I'm the best rapper alive!
I'm the best rapper alive! Tell Wayne to swallow his pride
Y'all niggas talkin' that jive, I'm talkin' that Malcolm X
Martin Luther hustles through to dip right through your fucking set
I'm the best rapper alive! I'm the best rapper alive!
I'm the best rapper alive! Jigga man should've retired
I'm goin' after Kanye, Lupe Fiasco, and Nas
Snoop Dogg and mister Andre, Eminem, Busta Buss Rhymes
Y'all better bust no more rhymes, I'ma start bustin' your ass
If you walk wit' a Mack Truck, then throw a bus on your ass!
Y'all be no action, no pass, we gon' start bustin' on niggas
Choppers be bustin' on niggas? Chopper be bustin' on niggas!
Fuck you and fuck you fuck niggas, I'm do this for Soul-o

They be like, "Oh no, wait, he's 'bout to take the whole cake
You goddamn right, got a big appetite wit' a big tapeworm, every day, I yearn
Another meal, I'm hungry, give some to my homie
Nigga, we made men and cavemen, livin' in the stone age
I got this ignorant type shit, from my uncle Tony
And may my nigga rest in peace, from heaven, I know you see

I'm Compton, Compton, nigga, I am Compton
A big-ass condom, motherfuck the LAPD

DA, and your honor got pumped up on Alondra
Trap my body, free my mind, hopin' y'all could see the sign

Kendrick
Kendrick, Kendrick Lamar


As my mind drift and then split
Like the middle of a spliff, I begin to catapult off
The cliff of the unknown
I got a feeling in my funny bone that we're not the same
Just antonyms of another age
My soul flock with the carefree
Words of the wise, I spoke a hundred times like a gold D
Ha ha LMFAO
I hate y'all but I spread love like mayo
Then spread slugs
My brain matter is a brain phantom
See my vision, or my vision'll stare at ya
This is the future if I say so, you copping fitted caps
I'm about to go and cop a halo
The God of rap and I mean it, and I play football with Mars
And marbles with Pluto and Venus
Witness the genius, I interact with the inner-city villains
That enters your system like a computer hack
Then give you dap


Mic check Ali
The mic don't sound right

Even the shooters can get shot, get shot quick
Even the shooters can get shot (Ali get it right)
Even the shooters can get shot, get shot quick
Even the shooters can get shot
Uh

Tell em I got plenty arson to sell em
Heat by the fleet displaying it very seldomly
I write till I ignite my cerebellum
Close to the pen like I had 3 felons
Come from a city where niggas show no remorse
And a corpse is just another hommy taking its course
Of course my dream was to play in the Final Four
Till the twelfth grade came and I was only 5'4
So now I'm a graduate looking to get hired
My pops knew a security job he inquired
But ignorance is bliss, that's what I was told
I stopped, dropped and rolled when somebody yelled fired
Now there goes another black boy unemployed
With a lot of free time which means he's vulnerable to run into a lot of crime
I wrote it in my rhymes
And when I left the porch this is what I realized

Even the shooters can get shot, get shot quick
Even the shooters can get shot (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Even the shooters can get shot, get shot quick
Even the shooters can get shot (yeah, yeah, yeah, was sup?)
These streets ain't none to play with
It could get outrageous
Got burners, .45s and gauges
That could really get outrageous

So I'm thinking to myself, what's next?
My security job only got me like 2 checks
My pops disappointed, told me I'm fuckin' up
Irresponsible and I need some growing up
I told him I would go back, knowing I wouldn't go back
Working a 9-to-5 is something I couldn't stomach
Surrounded by the violence
All the goons and the goblins
With 99 problems I still kept it 100
These streets can be rather manipulating
Especially when you're black and just turned 18
So what's a kid to do, when you're fresh out of school and the negatives of the world constantly following you?
Not to mention a local henchman, copped a sheriff's part like terrorists
Osama with badges that talk arrogant
That boy 15 and he holdin' a .45
30 years apart, 30 years before he realized

Uh
Soon as the beat drop, I bet some heat pop
On a block close to you like a relative
You sippin' Belvedere while these niggas plannin' to rob Mr. Belvedere
Yeah I'm a good kid tryna stay righteous as Martin Luther but it seems like all of my friends eventually become shooters
And niggas bangin' on you is something that you'll get used to
You can either fight back or run home and grab your Ruger
Whatever you do just make sure you're willing to do it
Being too indecisive can get you killed inside your Buick
'Cause you stopped at the light, 5 minutes from midnight
With no tinted windows that nigga surely had shot through it
You tell me you listening, but you don't hear the music
Call you Billy Hoyle when turmoil was near
This is the realest right here
When I lost my very first job
My pops said why?
I said I couldn't aim for the sky
'Cause even shooters can get shot

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, was sup?)
These streets ain't none to play with
It could get outrageous
Got burners, .45s and gauges
That could really get outrageous


You can own this city
You have everything you need
All it takes is all you got
Life don't ask you if you're ready or not
You can own this city
Deep inside you hold the key
While the world is fast asleep
You can take it all if you just dare to dream

Talk about goals
Talk about a pen and a pad and the pad of your house
With a permanent flow
Hennessy on the floor looking at a video on the couch
And the couch is cold
And the pouch in your mama pocket got a permanent hole
And your brother pout 'cause he want food on the stove
And a pedestal with a silver spoon, and a big pool
With a big room and a closet, 'cause it
Hurt when you laughing at his clothes
Looking at him like he ain't shit
Forever living in that commode
Time flies and I watch it tick
Look in the mirror and I gotta take risk
Like blood on the sheet of a suicide note
Tripod then I aim it at your soul
For bright lights
Bite like a alligator when I write
Hungry, come see determination upon me
Come see the visionary in my sight
My life premeditated by ambition
Pistons from my Nikes take off
No assistance, I'm persistent
Adolf, more than I can chew with this thought

You can own this city
You have everything you need
All it takes is all you got
Life don't ask you if you're ready or not
You can own this city
Deep inside you hold the key
While the world is fast asleep
You can take it all if you just dare to dream

Let's talk about pressure
Let's talk about depression
Let's talk about desperate
Times
Everyday I'm guessin'
My mind, it'll never end up resting
I climb a ladder every second
I find another mountain top
Another video I watch when that video go off
I jot like Edgar Allen, matter fact a thousand
Soldiers never could war off my talents
I wanna reassure my talents
I wipe my face but never throw my towel in
I'm often prowlin'
The edge of a quantum jump in my head
I'm a monster from anywhere but Earth
And I'm 1 of 1 ever since my birth, I came for some bright lights
Bite like a bear trap when I write
Hungry, gotta chip on my shoulder
I took it off and ate it
I made it a full meal
And I'm still craving, my front teeth
I sink in the rap game
My name will attract fame
My veins got the blood of a king in it
When it pours down, now Snoop's on stage and he say
"Kendrick"

You can own this city
You have everything you need
All it takes is all you got
Life don't ask you if you're ready or not
You can own this city
Deep inside you hold the key
While the world is fast asleep
You can take it all if you just dare to dream

So what you gonna do?
What you gonna do?
You can run, you can hide
But when you are chosen
The walls they close in
Your forefathers look you in your eyes
So what you gonna do?
What you gonna do?
You can run, you can hide
But when you are chosen
The walls they close in
Your forefathers look you in your eyes

You can own this city
You have everything you need
All it takes is all you got
Life don't ask you if you're ready or not
You can own this city
Deep inside you hold the key
While the world is fast asleep
You can take it all if you just dare to dream


I was born on February 24th, 1970
The day I was delivered, they said I would build a legacy
Picture me with influence that last generations
I was made out of love to keep you happy and educated
The first three letters of the alphabet my name
I made you laugh, I made you dance, I made you sing
I been around the world and back, you recorded my almanac
So dearly way before the fact me and pops was estranged
My father was a public figure, bigger than life
Lived as a winner, on stages alike
Rivers of people surely united, just to see our bond
Time carried on, that was a common thread
My perfect father had many flaws
Still they moved they legs and shook they heads in unison
He had more children, I was the oldest
We always played with each other 'fore they ruined 'em
He told me his personal secrets, childhood catching on beatings
Sexually touched and abused, never seen life in a school
The price of being iconic was demonic and screwed
I stood on stage and had to watch my father on the news
Stress on the head of my spirit, I was lost and confused
I knew both sides of the story, but still, I couldn't choose
See, it was more than humiliation and bein' sued
They crucified my affiliation for points to prove
And now my purpose for livin' makes no difference to you
My total existence was for makin' a smiling move
They said that I'll live forever
But the moment he died, more accusations arrived
I had to die too

I remember takin' my first breath August 28th, 1963
The whole nation had saved the day, I made it on TV
My come out was a standing ova', the crowd in disbelief
How could a group of words be so great?
Designed to make you think
Races and faces embracin' my conscience in letter form
How gracious was I speakin' on changes once outside the norm?
The person responsible, my creator
He never conformed or used hatred to form mass retaliation
Watch him perform with conviction
Two hundred and fifty thousand souls left they homes to listen
I gather his thoughts in abundance made to complete the mission
His life became heroic, then tables turned
My creator stripped from being a poet because he yearned
Other women, infidelity stricken, I can't say he was perfect
It made me nervous, they tear him down and forget me
I prayed that I survived in the midst of the controversy
How many lives'll fall on deaf ears if I'm not worthy?
I won't justify his personal problems, that's not my job
I was only born to make sure your children can play outside
And I imagine the other demons he hid before he died
If they came to surface, this dream probably won't be alive
Because of you

I was born in paranoia, it's poison for us
We can't create with joyous ambition, we're out of luck
The critics formed a new coalition and huddled up
The non-creators are now elated and out of touch
Why can't you gladly appreciate the influence we give?
Stop starin' at me disgusted, my substance made sure you'd lived
You want the head of the messenger and the history from him
Which eventually takes away from the good you accustom
Think of a life without the likes of imagination that's prosperin'
The bodies that you consider genius, you like to box 'em in
The great debaters and thinkers, they gave you a voice
Why can't you prosecute the crimes and not the thoughts I employ?
Because your better judgement will always look down on me
But if I recollect how we connect, you'll account on me
I got a theory that most of y'all won't allow to see
It goes like this, talent doesn't choose morality
See, if Daniel Hale was a killer, would you not want a heart?
If Carl Benz was a racist, would you stop driving cars?
I can't help we jump in these bodies and you called them a god
Just know the Earth is just a rock without the voices of art
Sincerely yours


Rare Breed, Kendrick Lamar
Breed up or speed up
Breed up or speed up
Breed up or speed up

This is for my niggas that be all blacked out
Hit the streets a hundred deep, what Rare Breed about?
Riding hard, bending corners, the girlies on us
Leave a hater scarred, big Dressers sit at the stop light
Road Glides and Road Kings deep in my hindsight
You do it right or don't do it at all
Put that candy paint on it, ride them twenty-threes homie
Custom seats, custom brakes, hit the streets and ball
Centre of attention like bynum and gasol, aw
You know that killer californication
When you feeling like you sitting on a ceiling, chasing
Dreams, hoping this conglomerate can run the nation
It's abomination how we bomb yo' block
I'm talking Big Punch, K-Dub, Baby Slip Billy
Bad Azz, Rare Breed, we all we got
See 'em out, show 'em love, chunk the deuce, give it up
It's a lot of bike clubs but they not this hard, nope

Pounding on the highway stretch
All blacked out, making sure we on deck
Might catch us on them Dressers or them Road Glides, yes
Tell the world I'm a Rare Breed baby
Breed up or speed up (don't stop, don't stop)
Breed up or speed up (don't stop, don't stop)
Breed up or speed up, I'm a Rare Breed baby

And it's like that to the death though
Two-oh-point and seeing decimals, I ain't lying
Pounding on the interstate in the state that shines
Or we might be in a hood near you
Around the globe baby, Rare Breed under control baby
Them pipes loud, the movement entice crowds
We heat it up in the cold baby
It's three degrees out? Then you should see me out
Or see bout them kitty cats and how they go meow
Ha-ha, we be the father of Harley drivers, so don't bother
Show you infants how to whip it, have a bye-bye
Posers try to hang? Then we hang 'em by the collar
Silk, lannie, Rare Breed family
Stunting hard like a black circus, voila
Breed up or speed up, get ahead
So with that said, bye-bye

Pounding on the highway stretch
All blacked out, making sure we on deck
Might catch us on them Dressers or them Road Glides, yes
Tell the world I'm a Rare Breed baby
Breed up or speed up (don't stop, don't stop)
Breed up or speed up (don't stop, don't stop)
Breed up or speed up, I'm a Rare Breed baby

Pounding on the highway stretch
All blacked out, making sure we on deck
Might catch us on them Dressers or them Road Glides, yes
Tell the world I'm a Rare Breed baby
Breed up or speed up (don't stop, don't stop)
Breed up or speed up (don't stop, don't stop)
Breed up or speed up, I'm a Rare Breed baby

Shouting out the one and only Rare Breed
Now Breed up!


This, this, this
Should be played at high volume
Preferably in a residential

Life's a bitch, life's a bitch
But I'mma keep the pussy wet (Yep)
I'mma keep the pussy wet (Yep)
I'mma keep the pussy wet (Yep)
I'mma keep the pussy wet (Yep)
My dick hard, her pussy wet

And I'm born with my dick in the earth
You can tell me how much am I worth
I'mma die with my heart on my sleeve
Many die on their hands and their knees
And I'm takin' whatever I need
And I'm raping the government fees
And you're wasting your time
And I'm speaking my mind on whatever I think
And I think that I'm Richard Pryor
With priors of 32 fiends
And that means that I hear for higher
Tell me why are you starin' at me?
Matter fact, man, your eyes is wired
You inspired by Kendrick the king
Maybe it's 'cause I'm living my dream
Man, I sing what I'm living about
And the words that come out of my mouth
They requires a random routine
Of being organic granite
Then my access is granted
To represent the shit that I conceive
And I guarantee that I'mma bring
My mind, body, soul
And I sold all these records off bein' myself
And I wish you can do the same thing, man
It's easier than a stripper
Or tyin' a baby shoestring, you stringing along
And really why you writing a song?
Your passion for music is never in sync
No secret societies guided me to the world of unseen
And they tell me life is a bitch, who gives a shit?
You'll get relief

I'mma keep the pussy wet (Yep)
I'mma keep the pussy wet (Yep)
My dick hard, her pussy wet
I'mma keep the pussy wet (Yep)

(Hi, ho!) I came
(Bye, ho!) I went
(Hi, ho!) I came
(Bye, ho!) I went
(Hi, ho!) I came
(Bye, ho!) I went
(Bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch)

And I see that you envy of me
Enemigos don't prosper
Better yet, they do die eventually
If I'm at the event you will leave
'Cause you know and I know that
I go ham even if Muslims is seen
In my rear view I'm near you
But I don't hear you, can you at least breathe?
With an oxygen mask, and
The masses keep saying I'm speaking for them
And if you can imagine my madness
Then you can see where I've been
And the places the Louis has been
And I swear I been doing this when
You was in pajamas, watching B-Barney and Friends
And you couldn't harm me even with ten
Weapons of your choice riding in
Army tanks, you shot blanks
And I shot back, make your duplex bend
What the fuck you think? If I don't think
Then I'm right back where the city sin
What the fuck you drink?
Thinking I can't write these raps in the Lions' Den
When I hear that you lyin', then?
It's murder she wrote, ain't no hope
You go downhill, man, where's your slope?
Get thrown downhill tied to a rope
Tell the world to put intervals
Man, I swear this the anecdote
And they tell me that life is a bitch
Who gives a shit when you know?

And I see that you envy of me
Don't prosper, better yet, they do die eventually
'Cause you know and I know that I go ham even if Muslims is seen
In my rear view I'm near you
But I don't hear you, can you at least breathe?

(Hi, ho!)
(Bye, ho!)


I woke this mornin' undecided
My demons takin' over my life, yeah
Sooner or later it's a family divided
These patterns gettin' hard to hide, yeah

They say I should be satisfied
They tell me I got the world, but that's a lie
I wished the way I feel could be pacified, sometimes
I wish I was somebody
Anybody but myself
Oh, I wish I was somebody
Anybody but myself

If I told you I'm 'bout to break would you look at me different?
Character out of place, would I lose your attention?
Let me know your intentions, 'cause lately I been watchin' everybody
It's apparent that transparency never seen monotony
Got off of tour, lookin' for closure
Mixin' emotions of bein' grateful and feelin' like some of y'all gettin' over
What's a puppet on stage, singin' and dancin' ablaze?
But trading his worth, distorted by the money that's made
A slave with a verse, I feel like Prince Rogers
I feel liberation is free, I feel I should miss the Oscars
Are you celebrating me as the artist or just a profit?
A question I have for the ones around me that's turnin' toxic
My lungs been heavy from all the smokescreen booby-traps
Reminiscin' on what it was, and knowin' that this ain't that
I vision a rock in a hard place
Hope my daughter isn't born with a piece of my heartbreak
You know stress carries on and your kids reap the mistakes that you made
And I admit that I can be dismissive if I can't relate
And I admit that I only commit to start playin' games
And I admit that I'm bad at talkin' myself out of shame
But who's to blame when the crowds stop cheerin' and they passin' dirty looks?
I now understand that I'll never be understood

Isolation didn't work for me (Work for me)
Socializing didn't work for me even
Prayed about it, didn't work for me (Work for me)
You can't cure this disease
The pain too traumatic for relief
Pull up the curtains, let the audience see

I wish I was somebody (Somebody else, oh, somebody else, oh)
Anybody but myself (Somebody else, oh)
Oh, I wish I was somebody (Somebody else, oh)
Anybody but myself


[Kendrick Lamar:]
Hold up is that you?
With them big ol' thighs after school
J-305 had gave me high five when I said I'm in hot pursuit
Hold up is that you?
With them big ol' thighs after school
J-305 had gave me high five when I said I'm in hot pursuit
Hold up is that you?
With them big ol' thighs after school
J-305 had gave me high five when I said I'm in hot pursuit

You said I won't ride until Kendrick drive a new Monte Carlo that cruise
And that shot my pride, I tried to improv, but no freestyle, I never do
Ya lookin' for the nigga with the tallest 'fetti'
Ya overlookin' every nigga that ain't quite ready
To make it rain on ya like I'm boutta break a levee (hol up!)
That pussy petty
Yeah ya nails did, ya hair did, your cellphone is selfish
It only got numbers that come with a hummer her new primadonna I smelt it
Tried to make ya mine.. (ho)
Tried to make some time.. (ho)
But I ain't got the time or the patience to stop and wait in line.. (ho)
Her dream soap Versace, she fall for Armani
I only deal with rich niggas, fuck you and Mitt Romney
I'm grown now, I'm on my own now, I'm poppin'
Change my phone now, when I get home now, I got options
Fast forward, wait is that you?
With them big ol' thighs after school?
And your three kids and three baby daddies same car note that's overdue?
I know

[Sample of Gotye's "Somebody That I Used To Know":]
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing


[Lloyd:]
I'm way past gone, and I just see the bottom of this bottle
I just woke up to a room full of models
Who know that I ain't calling them tomorrow
It's been so long, since I have been on this level right here
Waking up, after I pass out, I put my clothes on, before I mash out
'Cause I've been losing my mind, wasting my time
Fucking these hoes and sipping this wine
Skipping the line to get in aside
Playing the part and feeling them lies
Shawty says she need a ride
I tell her cool and get ready to slide
Next in my room, I hit her from behind
Doing and doing like I'm pressing rewind

'Cause I have never babysitting, I be lining up shots
I'm 'a show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I wash them apart
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor I'm 'a dive in it all

Pour up, drank, head shot, drank
Sit down, drank, stand up, drank
Pass out, drank, wake up, drank
Faded, drank, faded, drank

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Now I done grew up
'Round some people living their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask
Back stroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels
Some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular
That was my problem
I was in the dark room
Loud tunes, looking to make a vow soon
That I'm 'a get fucked up, fillin' up my cup
I see the crowd mood
Changing by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me:

Nigga why you babysitting only two or three shots?
I'm 'a show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor I'm 'a dive in it

Pour up, drank, head shot, drank
Sit down, drank, stand up, drank
Pass out, drank, wake up, drank
Faded, drank, faded, drank

Okay, now open your mind up and listen to me, Kendrick
I'm your conscience, if you do not hear me
Then you will be history, Kendrick
I know that you're nauseous right now
And I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down
I'm 'a drown in some poison abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe
I see the love in her eyes, I see the feelin'
The freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrive
This how you capitalize
This is parental advice
Then apparently, I'm over influenced by what you are doin'
I thought I was doin' the most then someone said to me

Nigga why you babysitting only two or three shots?
I'm 'a show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor I'm 'a dive in it

Pour up, drank, head shot, drank
Sit down, drank, stand up, drank
Pass out, drank, wake up, drank
Faded, drank, faded, drank

I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one hundred shots, bang
Hop out. Do you; bang?
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang
I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one hundred shots, bang
Hop out, do you, bang
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang

Nigga why you babysitting only two or three shots?
I'm 'a show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor I'm 'a dive in it

Pour up, drank, head shot, drank
Sit down, drank, stand up, drank
Pass out, drank, wake up, drank
Faded, drank, faded, drank


Don't tell a lie on me
I won't tell the truth 'bout you
Don't tell a lie on me
I won't tell the truth 'bout you

Thirty millions later, my future favors
The legendary status of a hip-hop rhyme savior
Travel round the atlas in this spaceship
Candy-coated, my day shift's
Been devoted to fuckin' up bundles of paper
Pi equals three-fourteen
The devil's pie is big enough to justify the whole thing
Wait up, lampin' in Jamaica
The clouds turnin', my thoughts turnin'
Burnin' castor oil, yo I been determined to make an earnin'
This seed in this soil is classified
I'm satisfied when I strategize my kid's future
I ain't sanctified enough to say that I won't shoot you
I done vandalized the industry full circuit
The earthiest slash thirstiest nigga you know versus this
Scum of a land that transcend two surfaces
The richer the poorer, the bigger the picture
The more blood pours, but—

Don't tell a lie on me
I won't tell the truth 'bout you
Don't tell a lie on me
I won't tell the truth 'bout you

My fans can't wait for me to son your punk-ass
And crush your whole little shit
I'll Big Pun your punk-ass, you a scared little bitch
Tiptoein' around my name, nigga, you lame
And when I get at you, homie
Don't you just tell me you was just playin'
"Oh, I was just playin', K-Dot
C'mon, you know a nigga rock with you, bro"
Shut the fuck up, you sound like the last nigga I know
Might end up like the last nigga I know
Oh, you don't wanna clash? Nigga, I know
I put my foot on the gas, head on the floor
Hoppin' out before the vehicle crash, I'm on a roll
Yellin', "One, two, three, four, five
I am the greatest rapper alive"
So damn great, motherfucker, I've died
What you hearin' now is a paranormal vibe
House on the hill, house on the beach, nigga (Facts)
A condo in Compton, I'm still in reach, nigga (Facts)
I'm fresh out the water, I'm 'bout to breach, nigga
The five-foot giant woke up out of his sleep, nigga
Oh yeah, oh yeah, more cars, more lears
More bars, no peers, no scars, no fear—fuck y'all, sincere
I heard the whispers, I curved the whispers
You know what the risk is
Earthed in ditches, your body revertin' to stiffness
The whole world gone mad
Bodies is addin' up, market's about to crash
Niggas is fake rich, bitches is fake bad
Blacks that act white, whites that do the dab
Donald Trump is a chump
Know how we feel, punk—tell him that God comin'
And Russia need a replay button, y'all up to somethin'
Electorial votes look like memorial votes
But America's truth ain't ignorin' the votes
It's blasphemy, how many gon' blast for me?
I prophesied on my last song, you laughed at me
But when the shit get brackin', don't you aks for me
How many leaders gon' tell you the truth after me?
G Malone, big bro, kudos to him
I was two Os from a M, tryna be big as Em
Thirty millions later, my future favors
The legendary status of a hip-hop rhyme savior
Salmon and capers, fame and lawsuits
You lookin' at me in Chucks, I'm lookin' at y'all suits
Me and Top Dawg playin' rock-paper-scissors in court
A real hustler lose money just to go get some more
I said it's like that, dropped one classic, came right back
'Nother classic, right back
My next album, the whole industry on a ice pack
With TOC, you see the flames
In my E-Y-Es it's not a game
And the whole world is goin' mad, daddy, it's sad, daddy
My only advice? Go and get you a bag, daddy
Lee Baca on trial tryna portray a boxer
Beatin' up on my niggas while the COs watch him
Tables turned, lesson learned, my best look
You jumped sides on me, now you 'bout to meet Westbrook
Go celebrate with your team and let victory vouch you
Just know, the next game played I might slap the shit out you
Technical foul, I'm flagrant, I'm foul
They throwin' me out, you throw in the towel
Look at the crowd, they— (Naw, I don't like that)
Look at my smile, I'm smirkin'
Calm but urgent (That ain't the style, fuck!)
So many verses, you live in denial (Fuck!)
So many verses, I never run out (What?)
You makin' him nervous, the music is loud
Ho, JAY-Z Hall of Fame, sit yo' punk-ass down!
(Sit yo punk-ass down)
So that means you ain't bigger than rapping (What else?)
So that means no more playin' the back scenes (What else?)
My spot is solidified if you ask me (What else?)
My name is identified as "That King"
I'll let y'all worry 'bout a list, I'm on some other shit
A difference between accomplishments and astonishments
You know what time it is, ante up, this is in forever
Y'all got 'til April the 7th to get y'all shit together

Let's get it!
Look, look!
On foenem


[Kendrick Lamar:]
As I get a little older, I realize life is perspective
And my perspective may differ from yours
I wanna say thank you to everyone that's been down with me
All my fans, all my beautiful fans
Anyone who's ever gave me a listen, all my people

I come from a generation of pain, where murder is minor
Rebellious and Margielas'll chip you for designer
Belt buckles and clout, overzealous if prone to violence
Make the wrong turn, be it will or the wheel alignment
Residue burned, mist of the inner-city
Miscommunication to keep homi' detective busy
No protection is risky
Desensitized, I vandalized pain, covered up and camouflaged
Get used to hearin' arsenal rain
Analyze, risk your life, take the charge
Homies done fucked your baby mama once you hit the yard, that's culture
Twenty-three hour lockdown, then somebody called
Said your little nephew was shot down, the culture's involved
I done seen niggas do seventeen, hit the halfway house
Get out and get his brains blown out, lookin' to buy some weed
Car wash is played out, new GoFundMe accounts'll proceed
A brand-new victim'll shatter those dreams, the culture

[Kendrick Lamar {Marvin Gaye}:]
(I want, I want, I want, I want)
{But I want you to want me too} (I want, I want, I want, I want)
I want the hood to want me back (I want, I want, I want, I want)
I want the hood
Look what I done for you (Look what I done for you)
Look what I done for you

[Kendrick Lamar:]
I said I do this for my culture
To let y'all know what a nigga look like in a bulletproof Rover
In my mama's sofa was a doo-doo popper
Hair trigger, walk up closer, ain't no Photoshoppin'
Friends bipolar, grab you by your pockets
No option if you froze up, always play the offense
Niggas goin' to work and sellin' work, late for work
Workin' late, prayin' for work, but he on paperwork
That's the culture, point the finger, promote ya
Remote location, witness protection, they gon' hold ya
The streets got me fucked up, y'all can miss me
I wanna represent for us
New revolution was up and movin'
I'm in Argentina wiping my tears full of confusion
Water in between us, another peer's been executed
History repeats again
Make amends, then find a nigga with the same skin to do it
But that's the culture, crack a bottle
Hard to deal with the pain when you're sober
By tomorrow, we forget the remains, we start over
That's the problem
Our foundation was trained to accept whatever follows
Dehumanized, insensitive
Scrutinize the way we live for you and I
Enemies shook my hand, I can promise I'll meet you
In the land where no equal is your equal
Never say I ain't told ya, nah
In the land where hurt people hurt more people
Fuck callin' it culture

[Kendrick Lamar {Marvin Gaye}:]
(I want, I want, I want, I want)
{But I want you to want me too} (I want, I want, I want, I want)
I want the hood to want me back (I want, I want, I want, I want)
I want the hood
Look what I done for you (Look what I done for you)
Look what I done for you

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Take the drums out

Celebrate new life when it come back around
The purpose is in the lessons we learnin' now
Sacrifice personal gain over everything
Just to see the next generation better than ours
I wasn't perfect, the skin I was in had truly suffered
Temptation, impatience, everything that the body nurtures
I felt the good, I felt the bad, and I felt the worry
But all-in-all, my productivity had stayed urgent
Face your fears, always knew that I would make it here
Where the energy is magnified and persevered
Consciousness is synchronized and crystal-clear
Euphoria is glorified and made His
Reflectin' on my life and what I done
Paid dues, made rules, change outta love
Them same views made schools change curriculums
But didn't change me starin' down the barrel of the gun
Should I feel resentful I didn't see my full potential?
Should I feel regret about the good that I was into?
Everything is everything, this ain't coincidental
I woke up that morning with more heart to give you
As I bleed through the speakers, feel my presence
To my brother, to my kids, I'm in Heaven
To my mother, to my sis, I'm in Heaven
To my father, to my wife, I am serious, this is Heaven
To my friends, make sure you countin' them blessings
To my fans, make sure you make them investments
And to the killer that sped up my demise
I forgive you, just know your soul's in question
I seen the pain in your pupil when that trigger had squeezed
And though you did me gruesome, I was surely relieved
I completed my mission, wasn't ready to leave
But fulfilled my days, my Creator was pleased
I can't stress how I love y'all
I don't need to be in flesh just to hug y'all
The memories recollect just because y'all
Celebrate me with respect
The unity we protect is above all
And Sam, I'll be watchin' over you
Make sure my kids watch all my interviews
Make sure you live out our dreams we produced
Keep that genius in your brain on the move
And to my neighborhood, let the good prevail
Make sure them babies and the leaders outta jail
Look for salvation when troubles get real
'Cause you can't help the world until you help yourself
And I can't blame the hood the day that I was killed
Y'all had to see it, that's the only way to feel
And though my physical won't reap the benefits
The energy that carry on emits still
I want you


Uh, a little Compton nigga
Just a little Compton nigga, one time
For my niggas
You know Compton, nigga
Just a little Compton nigga, uh, uh
Kendrick Lamar, uh
Yo, uh

Back with a vengeance
Back with my heart and I'm venting
Back with another war pendant, salute me or shoot me
I never wore a kufi, ignored my religion
I believe there's one God, there's one love
And I believe if I fly, we all doves
I make a way for my people to see the light
Brighter than yellow bones, me and my microphone could be one
Until I see BIG, 'Pac, see Pun, but this ain't (Eazy)
I can't take a (Big L), my city needs me
I gotta win, the proof is in the pudding
And I've been fucking with Cosby since I was ten, you damn right
Any means necessary, get the campaign right
Very emotional, I'm a Gemini
I love hard and I fight harder, a born author
A born starter, in the game for real
And the games appeal to the struggling youth with no father
You can't learn if mistakes ain't made
You gotta pay your homage in order to get paid
You gotta pay attention in order to pay dues
And you ain't gettin' it, 'til you start payin' Jews
Lifestyles of the young and the broke
With my hand under oath, I recite these quotes
And if I ever lied then I'd die where I stand
As a pest, not a man, but a roach and a rat
In order to see the front, I had to play the back
We played our position, we let y'all play yourself
Y'all made your decision, we pray while we prey on competition
To flip another page of Corinthians
I see stars when I write these sentences
Words crash cars when I write these sentences
Open jail bars for my niggas' life sentences
Free J-Dove, kill all witnesses
Y'all better hope 2012 really real
'Cause the way I feel, I'ma make y'all suffer
And take y'all supper
I haven't ate in the last twenty-two summers and I'm twenty-two now
It's about to go down, so en garde my God
We got these artists in awe
Oh, I'm free
Finally, I can say I'm me
The Kendrick Lamar EP a classic EP
The question concerns
I dropped it and gave the whole world my germs
Hope y'all infected, hope y'all ain't have no protection
Still I'm progressing, room for improvement
Make room for the groom married to his music
I was at the XXL just trying to excel
Networking, meanwhile my stomach turning
Wanted to be a part of it, cater it to my audience
J. Cole running late, if he don't show up
Think I can take his place? Ladies start laughing
No pun intended, I ain't being sarcastic
Homie popped up with about twenty bags and
Fresh out the plane, I couldn't even complain
My nigga was on his hustle, I introduced him my name
Said I'll see him on the bubble in the future
My dude I salute ya, contributing the real shit
Talk about it, make the people talk about it, make the world see
For every MC that I see tryna stay afloat
Tell 'em build a boat like Noah
And take him to a place that I'm sure we all can blow up, boom
I ain't a star yet but I'm getting close to 'em
And if you see a whack artist, do more than boo him
Throw him off the banister, shoot him on camera
Then kill his manager, than hang a banner up
That reads you can't proceed without being conceived
By one album of the nineties
On Rosecrans where you'll find me
And all my niggas is grimy, but I remain the good kid
Tryna make a difference where I'm from, where you live
Oh no, we've got to slow the city down
I told the homeboy pump his brakes
He said that he'd rather put the pump to his face
Sawed off, torture
Turn the saw off, it's scorching
Hot where I'm from, the newscasters don't come
Another ratchet got dumped, in the trash can
I ain't done, a baby in there with it
She said postpartum did it
Molested at eleven and she always reminiscing
When he was undressing, said it'll only be a minute
That's why I I think I'm always kicking something with some feeling
I should have been a dentist, I should have been a blizzard, cold
Flash, pose, flash, pose
A critic paparazzi got me on my toes
I wanna jump on him like a tadpole
Tadpole, assholes
Tryna kill my dreams, not elevate?
Those are not my dreams, I'll be straight
With a little bit of passion
And a (drive) like an Aston
Motivation from Nipsey or Glasses, Jay Rock
Mykestro, Bad Lucc, U-N-I
Dom Kennedy, MURS and Fashawn
Lady G, Willy B, in time
I'ma (blow) like I'm motherfucker sniffing lines
Go like I've never seen a red light shine
Flow to my heart hit the flo' when I'm dying
Heart of a lion, tell 'em get in line
And pass the baton, I won't pass it back
I ain't good at dimes
If the bitch bad I could pass you a dime
Haters better duck like I'm passing a pond
Know I'm the king and I'm passing you pawns
Pad om the hill, that's a passion of mine
Problem is I shine
Like two mics under heavy strobe lights
I'ma need two mics just to get my point across
I'ma get my joint across, country y'all gon' want me!

"This is a song that makes me spill out all my guts—"


[Kendrick Lamar:]
One, two, one, two, one two
Mm
One, two, one, two, one two
One, two
Turn the headphones up, Ali
One, two
You mix with Dre, right?
he he he he he
Turn the headphones up

When the whole world see you as Pac reincarnated
That's enough pressure to live your whole life sedated
Find the tallest building in Vegas and jump off it
But I could never rewrite history in a coffin
So I'm talking to God, "Can you wash all these demons off me?"
This last year been quite similar to Aaliyah
Control my own destiny, only rapper that steered a G5
Gs give high-fives to me and say, "Kendrick, just persevere
The presence of being real."
As I lay in this four-corner room staring at candles
Thinking, "How can I make an example for this generation of Compton?"
My biggest fear is not feeling accomplished
Or turning back to that same accomplice
My past life was a child with no act-right
Tryna smile in a room of killers, turn into a crash site
Influenced by niggas that spoke the gang culture fluent
Assuring that some blossom early and some truant
Thank God for the album I idolized
"It's Dark and Plus Hell is Hot"—that's the start of this crazy ride
Two young niggas, me and Dave inside the garage
And thought we was Jay and Dame
That's the lane that we tried to drive
Truthfully, I just started rappin' to get away
I never thought that your favorite rapper would want a verse
My nigga got hit 25 times with a K
Make the decision: Ride the beat or ride in a hearse
Now Punch is my mentor, Top Dawg is the coach
Jay Rock is my older brother, I was there when he wrote
His name on his record deal, we had figured the coast
Would live on a pedestal, once the shit hit the store
Found ourselves scrambling, tryna figure it out
Soul told me that the record shop 'bout to go in a drought
Q ain't got a place to stay and 'bout to sleep on the couch
We eating off each other tray, the dollar-menu amount
Meanwhile, the coast going hard at each other
The younger rappers had wanted some of the OGs' comfort
But I ain't need it
I never screamed out, "The New West." I didn't believe it
They brung each other down, I was planning out my achievements, huh
I need to separate myself to stand out, huh
I need a better way to take your fans now, huh
I need to kill you motherfuckers dead (Doot doot doot)
Three hollow-tips aimed at your head (Doot doot doot)
I'll be damned if the chopper jam now (Doot doot doot doot)
And we never asked for no handout
In the midst of it, all I recall a call when you said how
We could never resolve in the Hall of Fame
And I went to trial with a Bible and rifle
I play the game as I "blam-blaow!"
Holler back at me, nigga
And if they said that I'm the one, why you asking me, nigga?
'Cause when the whole world see you as Pac reincarnated
Enough pressure to make you just open the Book of David
And pray to God that you make it or live your life in the Matrix
'Cause falling off is a sickness—I heard that it's quite contagious
I need to separate myself to stand out, huh
I need a better way to take your fans now, huh
I need to kill you motherfuckers dead
Three hollow-tips aimed at your head

[Ab-Soul:]
I'll be damned if the chopper jam now
And we never ask for no handouts
I'll take you back to that pack of Black & Milds in my hand now (Soul!)
In the midst of it all, was cooking, them pots and pans out
Looking forward as four of us forced to form a new clan now
Fast-forward as I wait in line for this passport
The homies was still poor, with work in a Jansport

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Whoever thought that Rosenberg would mention me to Dre?
Even Vanessa from XXL had told him press "Play"
And there goes my fate; now, I'm on stage with Snoop
Gave me the torch and I ran with it in hot pursuit
Rapped with my forefathers, even wreck it with Gaga, too
Lyricist of the year, fuck am I 'posed to do? Rock!

[Jay Rock:]
Laughing at you niggas out there who thought we was flukes
Exaggerated shit that we rapped had came true
Thought I was aggravated when Warner had let me loose
I was honored—see, they was haunted when Mike Jones didn't recoup

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Cool, 'cause niggas won't outdo us in the booth
Even when my album leak, fans still buy it for proof
I came, I saw, I conquered
No shame, I blame all of this on Compton
Thinking 'bout when Sherane tried to set me up
Cold game, full circle, they set up her
I put my life in these twelve songs, my fight in these twelve songs
The fight to ignite any wrong and right that I prolong
The story, the short film, the glory of him and them
The worry of mothers that don't recover when babies killed
The trial and the tribulations, the newer Miseducation
The view of a body wasting, you knew somebody who ain't make it
The angry, the adolescent, the reason I ask this question:
Will you let hip-hop die on October 22nd?
Will you let hip-hop die on October 22nd?


Praise to the almighty, HiiiPower
Me and my niggas (Live forever)
3 eyes to my alumni
Feel this
I wanna hear it, turn me up (My niggas on point, game tight)
Turn me up a little bit more nigga (My niggas on point, game tight)
My nigga Cole in this motherfucker. Wassup nigga?
(My niggas on point, game tight)
There we go yeah, turn me up

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Picture plenty pussies throwing pellet guns at me
Paranoia make it more than difficult for me to sleep
Pinnacle, I know I be, centerfold, I know I got
But they hate to frame me as the Mona Lisa of hip-hop
So retaliation is a must, when we bend the block
My niggas dump'n out the roof, (Do-do-do-do-do)
Drive past, guns blast, shooting up the charts too
Uh, me K-D-O-T, put TNT inside my suit
Walk inside the label, struck a match, and then I blew, bomb
C4 everywhere, C4 everywhere
I got three whores with me, it smells like Dior and derrière
Decoys die slow, you can detour to Heaven's stairs
Or walk inside Hell's dungeon, I just might derail something
They pussies, I smell something
You douche on the daily, niggas, you pushin' up daisy
I push the gas on the Mercedes, nigga
Came in this game with a Rolie chain, and a dream
Became reality, made some casualties, my choppers scream

And now we dump'n out the roof, (Do-do-do-do-do)
Drive past, guns blast, shooting up the charts too
Uh, me K-D-O-T, put T-N-T inside my suit
Uh, walk inside the label, struck a match and then I blew
And now we dump'n out the roof, (Do-do-do-do-do)
Drive past, guns blast, shooting up the charts too
Uh, me K-D-O-T, put T-N-T inside my suit
Uh, walk inside the label, struck a match and then I blew

Nigga that thought Good Kid gon' flop, or that I might go pop
Or your bitch won't drop, knees when my shit drop
Y'all too infatuated with the fucking numbers
Which make it easy for me to divide and conquer
I come from Compton, we ain't have it all
Smokers basing inside the cafeteria hall
And I'm putting fear in you all, see your skeletons shaking
Jump out your body, you Ricky Bobby until you naked
Y'all pray to God this week I be putting out bombs
I pray to God this beat is good enough for Shyne
If not J. Cole, your shit is trash
But at least my opinion just made everyone laugh
This is where we at? I guess it's entertainment
I guess this is speculation making a classic came with
If I ain't have the patience I'd probably self destruct
Real people want real music, the jig is up

[Kendrick Lamar & J. Cole:]
Your worst fear is confirmed
We love that you crashed and burned
The real is back
K. Dot it's your turn, take your victory lap
King Cole salutin' Compton's own King Kendrick
That's the sky is falling, the wind is calling
Stand for something or die in the morning
The city hail King Kendrick Lamar
The world hail King Kendrick Lamar

[Kendrick Lamar:]
And now we dump'n out the roof, (Do-do-do-do-do)
Drive past, guns blast, shooting up the charts too
Uh, me K-D-O-T, put T-N-T inside my suit
Uh, walk inside the label, struck a match and then I blew
And now we dump'n out the roof, (Do-do-do-do-do)
Drive past, guns blast, shooting up the charts too
Uh, me K-D-O-T, put T-N-T inside my suit
Uh, walk inside the label, struck a match and then I blew

This is my life and I look at it like it's my last
And I'm lookin' right past the future as I reminisce on my past
And I don't even think how I used to, my mind is on rocket blast
And I don't even drink like I used too, and I don't even smoke
So you know this natural flow is for users that want to go to rehab
Lookin' at the coke that he had, matter fact that followers bother them
Then but I won't say my bad, see I just lay in the cut
Watch the product stack up, motherfucker what what
See now we dump'n out the roof


Oh, Lord, oh, Lord
Pretty ass girl over there, come play on ma nappy hair!
Drizzy Drake, here we go, look

Bitch, I'm gettin' it how I live, I put that on my left rib
25 with no kids but this dick you can babysit
25 lighters in the sky, what life is a real nigga
20 Al-Qaeda bomb when I do sight 'fore I kill niggas
Passion my preference, Benjamin Franklin my medicine
The MVP let him in, I'ma fuck up his letterman
Jackets with pendants on them
And I got plenty war story, politic never depended on 'em
Uncle Sam never did shit for me, mamma made miracles
Choppers drove me hysterical, cartoons and cereal
Pyramids on Imperial, that's the projects
And I make that progress from a tedious process
I'm a problem better yet a prospect, fuck that I'm a Loch Ness monster
Conquer, Compton, Hail King K-Dot, aka them casings of AK just sprayed your way uh, compensate for shooting for the stars muhafucka, click, brrt
Shooting up the charts, muhfucka
See, a rich nigga will buy anything that you sell 'em
A broke nigga believe anything that you tell 'em
I let smokers pump my gas, but I do that very seldom
Drop your ass at the unemployment, the only way I help 'em
They call me a role model, I'm still a baby myself
Hungover from last night, got to speak at your school at 12
Hennessy with the Sprite had me bouncing like Rumpelstiltskin
They caught me rummaging through women, I'm laughing like Elliott Wilson
Pay me respect and pay me on my checks
My first 50 thousand collected paid off some street debts
You know killers that looked out for me back when I was hungry
We go back like Reebok classics and black and blue saucony
I got a genuine clean slate, never you ask for my fucking rate
Never I'm handing out favors, bitch, every show now is 200k
As I write down my new bucket list, I can look down on your fucking hate
Get the fuck up when I'm in your presence, you listen when I fucking say

"What the fuck you niggas want from me? The only nigga that I owe is God!
Huh? Huh? Drizzy
What the fuck these niggas want from me? The only nigga that I owe is God!"


Reporting live, Compton California
The good kid

I'm tired of doing it
The same way, gotta flip it before I ruin it
Make it all make sense 'fore you put your two in it
Opinions get thrown out the window with Ron Browz
So turn me up loud so the world can hear
And when your favorite rapper rapping you should cover your ears
And go deaf, go deaf I said
Go death and stay dead, a shot to the forehead'll kill 'em
But I ain't here for no ignorance
I'm militant as Martin Luther King in the penitent
Aiming for my dreams 'til a bullet bounce off
One of my deep thoughts and hit a nigga in the spleen
I've got it in my genes, you probably think I'm talking 'bout a pistol
But I'm talking 'bout the blood of a warrior
My nigga, what you worry for? I ain't tryna jock your swag
I'm tryna better my craft and stay relevant, yeah

As time flies, hope that I'm soaring
Far from the boring, I'ma
Tell you why, it's important
I'm not the boring, I'ma
If I think and act like you do
The world would die from not seeing something new
And if I don't speak on how I feel
The world would lose out on what's really real
And if I should die before I wake
I pray my music will take my place
In the world... The Relevant

I'd rather you call me that
Than a typical artist you call wack
On a YouTube blog holding ARs and stacks
Of ones, but never could be the one
To rally communities or lead a crowd of blacks
Passion is too strong, I'm pissed off
So there's a chance you get pissed on, R. Kelly was in the wrong
But that don't make you an exempt
That don't make you a no-go from hitting the fence
You ain't a blood and damn sure you ain't a crip
The crowd yell "hoe" but I ain't a pimp
I'm me, I'm free as a five-finger discount
See you on the flip side right after I dismount
If I ever feel like I ain't pushing myself
I'll find a cliff, then push myself off the edge
Like a barber at the tip of your head
That's how I settle it, life or death if I ain't relevant, nigga

As time flies, hope that I'm soaring
Far from the boring, I'ma
Tell you why, it's important
I'm not the boring, I'ma
If I think and act like you do
The world would die from not seeing something new
And if I don't speak on how I feel
The world would lose out on what's really real
And if I should die before I wake
I pray my music will take my place
In the world... The Relevant

So feel free to not mind me
If you're used to boosters, drug dealers and shooters it's on wax
'Cause most of y'all niggas fabricate facts anyway
I could easily cheat and let the four-four play like a two-on-two orgy
But I've been there and it bores me
Got to the point where it did nothing for me
At forty I want to afford not to record bullshit in my story
And I'm mad young, so I'd rather do it now before my career's done
This is pain plus glory, victory is here
If I cried, you could see strength and pride in my tears
I do it for the kids
I do it for the twenty-three hour lockdowns doing time in the pen
And my pen is the only thing I got for Hip Hop to change the game
And they'll remember my name as The Relevant

As time flies, hope that I'm soaring
Far from the boring, I'ma
Tell you why, it's important
I'm not the boring, I'ma
If I think and act like you do
The world would die from not seeing something new
And if I don't speak on how I feel
The world would lose out on what's really real
And if I should die before I wake
I pray my music will take my place
In the world... The Relevant


So I met this young lady, ya know, when I went back home. I was tryna spit my best game to her, you know, give her my best cap, but she kept on snapping her fingers like [*snaps*]. I said, "You know what, girl? You crazy." Then she asked me what he said

(What did the Asian say?)
A peace of mind
That's what the Asian said, I need a divine
Intervention was his religion and now it's a prize
Him believing in Buddha, me believing in God
Asked me what am I doing, he said, "Taking my time"
Meditation is a must, it don't hurt if you try
See you thinking too much plus you too full of yourself
Worried about your career, ever think of your health?

(What did the Indian say?)
A piece of land
That's what the Indian said, I needed demand
Telling me longevity is in the dirt, buy some property first
Profit a better dollar with generational perks
Equity at his best, really, you should invest
These tangible things expire, don't you expect
Income with so much outcome and yes
Look at my heritage, we blessed

(Now what the black man say?)
A piece of nookie
That's what the black man said, I needed to push me
To the limit, satisfy my hunger
Do it all for a woman, hair cut to a wool
We like to live in the jungle, like to play in the peach
What you saying to me?
He said, "Homie, come back to reality for a week."
Nookie is power, cut on a new chick every night
I wouldn't be prouder, you should allow it

(What the white man say?)
A piece of mines
That's what the white man wanted when I rhyme
Telling me that he selling me just for $10.99
I go "Platinum" from rapping, I do the company fine
What if I compromise? He said it don't even matter
Make a million or more, you living better than average
You losing your core following, gaining it all
Put a price on my talent, I hit the bank and withdraw
Hit the bank and withdraw, hit the bank and withdraw
Put myself in the rocket ship and I shot for the stars
Tell me what you accomplished and what he said to the boy
I'mma make you some promises that you just can't ignore
Your profession anonymous as an artist
I don't target your market
You ain't signing your signature when I throw you my wallet
A lot of rappers are giving their demo all in the toilet
World tour, your masters, mortgage, I need ya

I holler, "What you do? What you say?"
I shall enjoy the fruits of my labor if I get freed today

What the black man say?
Tell 'em we don't die, tell 'em we don't die
Tell 'em we don't die, we multiply
Tell 'em we don't die, tell 'em we don't die
Tell 'em we don't die, we multiply
Tell 'em we don't die, tell 'em we don't die
Tell 'em we don't die, we multiply
Tell 'em we don't die, tell 'em we don't die
Tell 'em we don't die, we multiply


Two tears in a bucket, I cry with you, agh!
But I could never lie with you
I could never afford not to afford
I could never put my plans to the side with you
I could never see a red light
Like a deer with a headlight, I freeze up when I re-up
See, I barely have patience, and you're relating
Only the moment to complete us
Why you hate to work for it? Went to work for it
See, a nine-to-five was so jive turkey
But when Thanksgiving came, checks didn't hurt me
You plead the fifth, I read the fifth amendment
We both criminals with bad intentions
They say time heals all, but if I can shortcut my success
Corvettes by tomorrow, ugh!

Why so sad? Walking around with them blue faces
She said I'm down on my luck
And it's something I gotta have, blue faces
I hit the bank today and tell 'em color me bad, blue faces
Get that new money, and it's breaking me down

My homegirl got a credit card scam
She got a scholarship to college but she don't give a damn
Intuition got a black woman wishin'
She saying this on the phone with the noodles in the pan
I know you, woman, I console you, woman
You feel like the universe owes you, woman
Oh, the anticipation, hoping you could make it
Women don't prosper chasin' education
But you're talented, and can't handle it
And your homegirls can't be your manager
365 times four, plus more
Can't get it right, tell me, do you got the stamina?
But ain't no money like fast money
Even today, I'm considered a crash dummy
A rapper chasing stardom, how can I fast forward?
My accolades better than all them

But why I'm so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I'm down on my luck
And it's something I gotta have, blue faces (Faces)
I hit the bank today and tell 'em, color me bad, blue faces
Get that new money, and it's breaking me down, to the top

I love God, I love speed
I love drank, I love mead
I love oceans in the deep
I love women, I love me
I love God
Ugh! But I'm scared of godspeed
Sometimes

I wrote this song
Looking at a broke home, maybe (Broke home, maybe)
You know the poverty-stricken
The little broke boy and babies (Broke boy and babies)
Somebody say, "Kendrick American, they sure is crazy."
And I said, "Why?"
Then he looked me in the eye
And said, "Homie, you're messed up
You're banking on good luck, you're wishing for miracles
Never been through 'ish, you're crying hysterical
You settle for everything, complain about everything
YSay you sold crack, my world amphetamine
Your projects ain't it, I live in a hut
You're living to keep warm, I'm living to pay rent
I paid my way through, praying to Allah
You played your way through, dealing with Wi-Fi
Bull-'ishing yourself, you talking to strangers
Same thing go for the ones you came with
We all came on the boat looking for hope
And all you can say is that you're looking for dope, huh?
These days ain't no compromise, ugh
Your pain ain't mines half the time, ugh
A brand new excuse ain't nothing to me
See, I made my moves with shackled feet."

Cape Town, Cape Town
Cape Town, Cape Town
Cape Town
Cape Town, Cape Town
Ugh!

Cornrow Kenny
All morning with the mixed dashboards triple digits, skrrt!
Morning with the mixed dashboards triple digits, skrrt-skrrt!
Cornrow Kenny
So many plays on me, I finesse
Palisade views with some sex
I lost a lot of love for missionary
This the first time I react
Me and Top is like a Kobe-and-Phil
A father figure; play with him, you get killed
Play with me and he-a kill you himself
TDE the mafia of the west
Move in silence, yeah, we juggin' like that
Act of violence, yeah, we juggin' like that
I did a lot of dumb things in my past
Lord forgive me, hoping I don't relapse
Dave just bought a new 9-11
Almost thought I'd seen another plane crash
Q just bought a brand-new McLaren
Rock-a-lack about to buy the projects
Moosa got his son dripping in gold
Me, I'm about to let my hair down to hoes
Ali 'bout to let his hair down to hoes
Top billing, that's a million a show
Might blow the whole no-whammy on Soul
Might tell Obama, "Be more like Punch."
Sounwave got a Grammy this year
Mackwop, bet he do what he want
Level two, level two, no, I'm not done
You ain't gotta tell me that I'm the one
I could put a rapper on life support
Guaranteed, something that none of you want
Ten homies down and they all serving life
Ward is like twenty-five hundred a month
What if I empty my bank out and stunt?
What if I empty my bank out and stunt?
You ain't gotta tell me that I'm the one
You ain't gotta tell me that I'm the one
You ain't gotta tell me that I'm the one
You ain't got, you ain't got
You ain't got, you ain't got
Tell me that, tell me that that I'm the one
You ain't got, you ain't got, you ain't got
You ain't got tell me that, what! I'm the one
Yes, I'm the one!


[Kendrick Lamar:]
I swear you people don't know Kendrick, you don't know him
But you say you want some more Kendrick, I'm 'bout to show 'em
Everything inside this human being, I'm still growing
I'm a premature, baby in this crazy life that we adore
Doors on the Lamborghini, I want 'em
Can't afford 'em so I tell the swap meet to clone 'em
I guess I really am a vanity slave
I guess my ancestors turning in they graves
Burning money when I get it, fuck a life savings
Overdraft bank statements just to make a statement
When I put this fashion on, I'm a fashion junkie
Picking cotton in the country, I bought this out the country
Whips and chains, whips and chains, Jacob know my name
He call me Kunta, you my brother, we come from the same
Modern world, that's your girl? I see she rocking Fendi
Try this on, if it ain't upscale then you may offend me
Copping everything in sight, ignoring they sacrifice
Amnesia if I see the Black Visa in my hand tonight
I show my dick and then I swipe, that's a punchline
They was hot and I wore ice, that's ironic huh?

[Kendrick Lamar (Gucci Mane):]
Word around town that I'm all about the bitches
Word around town that I love my twenty-sixes
Word around town that I gotta stay paid
Lord please forgive me, I'm a vanity slave
(It's the Guc', cock and shoot
Found my swag but lost my roof, BURR! BURR!)
Lord please forgive me, I'm a vanity slave
(See my Audemar tick as my Audemar tock)
Lord please forgive me, I'm a vanity slave (BURR!)

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Aw man, videos got me wanting hoes
Appetite for flashing lights, all I can do is pose
A black male, on Melrose
I should get blackmailed, by my people hell Rose
Niggas that ain't had shit for four-hundred years
Overcompensate by over-accessorising with gear
Many of y'all don't see my vision
I do it for the love of hip-hop and the love of bitches
Am I a hypocrite 'cause everyday I'm contradicting?
I think of how I'm living, then I watch "How I'm Livin'"
I know this can't be right, my conscience tell me to stay righteous
It's unlikely to see what I like and say I don't like it
Biggest dilemma, my priorities ignoring me
I wanna move accordingly, but baby steps are premature remember?
I'm flying to the south and I'll be gone 'til November
To see my family tree, but this a shame I'm yelling out timber

[Kendrick Lamar (Gucci Mane):]
Word around town that I'm all about the bitches
Word around town that I love my twenty-sixes
Word around town that I gotta stay paid
Lord please forgive me, I'm a vanity slave
(It's the Guc', cock and shoot
Found my swag but lost my roof, BURR! BURR!)
Lord please forgive me, I'm a vanity slave
(See my Audemar tick as my Audemar tock)
Lord please forgive me, I'm a vanity slave (BURR!)

Cold, oh so cold
How ironic? He bought it, then sold his soul
Is it masonic for your vice to take it's toll?
The remote control is taking control
Lift up the doors
That Lamborghini I wanted come with a dumb-ass model that in Vogues
I like 'em both, I'll wife 'em both
Take these motherfucking Jordans off, put on my Loafs
'Cause nothing goes bad every time I wear (Gucci!)
I'm getting more ass every time I wear (Gucci!)
They tell me it's a fad every time I wear (Gucci!)
But should I give a fuck when it bring me more coochie?
This a young nigga's pedigree, I pray the Lord can better me
If not he 'bout to strike me down like this my third felony
Them voices keep on telling me, Kendrick don't forget about us
I burned my wardrobe, hoping that I could live without it

Word around town that I'm all about the bitches
Word around town that I love my twenty-sixes
Word around town that I gotta stay paid
Lord please forgive me, I'm a vanity slave
(It's the Guc', cock and shoot
Found my swag but lost my roof, BURR! BURR!)
Lord please forgive me, I'm a vanity slave
(See my Audemar tick as my Audemar tock)
Lord please forgive me, I'm a vanity slave (BURR!)


[Kendrick Lamar:]
Have you ever been punched in your motherfuckin' face?
What you say? Oh, you haven't? Alright, wait, bitch

[Baby Keem:]
Two phone Baby Keem, fuck you mean? I am here, ho
Ice cream, booger colored piss, Sub-Zero
No, ho, hookers in my clique, we don't fear ho
Lit, lit, lit, lit, lit, lit, lit, lit
I got a way, I got a politic, I got a bae
Ain't no apologies when I get paid
A dermatologist, I want the face
Don't talk to me when I step in this bitch
Ho, ho, pussy watery, I got the tuna fish, ho, ho, yeah
Uh, these niggas actin' like groupie, huh
Lil' bitch, she wanna get mad 'cause I keep on lookin' all in her booby, huh
I got definitive options, my U-Haul movin', coochie to coochie, huh
I buy the toe when I shop it, rock band on toosie now it look spooky, huh, huh
Easy there boy, shit get greedy there, boy
I rep pg there, boy, my gang need me there, boy
If my sex tape leak, your bitch on TV there, boy
Watch her please me there, boy
Shit get greedy there, boy
I must admit, I am a mess, I cannot fix it, mh
Lil' baby thick, Margiela sweats, look at my dick print, mh
Fuck all the raps, if you confess, that is a big hit, huh
Fuck all the raps, if you confess, it get addressed, bitch

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Have you ever been punched in your motherfuckin' face?
What you say? Oh, you haven't? Alright, wait, bitch

I want the fade (I want the fade)
Give me my fade, I want the fade
I need the fade, I need my-
We gotta fade
Give me my fade (Fade)
We gotta fade (Fade)
Give me my fade, I want the fade
I, I need the fade, fade
Run me my fade, fade
I can't please everybody, not even me
I wanna please God, but my issues too deep
Bless up, gotta change my number every week
Enemigo, I got 'em hot, I got 'em greased
Shut the fuck up, can't you see my daughter sleep?
Shut the fuck up

Servin' up a look, dancin' in the drought
"Hello" to the rain man, never losin' count
Ventin' in the safe house, ventin' in the safe house

Can I vent all of my truth? I got nothin' to lose
I got problems in pools, I can swim in my faith
Cameras movin', whenever I'm movin'
The family suin' whatever I make
Murder his stackin', the president actin'
The government taxin' my funds in the bank
Homies attracting the feds when I'm brackin'
Look at my reaction, my pupils on skates (Whoa, whoa)
Everything jaded (Jaded)
Team on "Go", let's get it (Get it)
Green gon' grow like veggie (Veggie)
Casino on my debit (Debit)
Fuck your rhetoric, fuck your leverage
Chain no evidence, pass go, motherfuck Confederate
Flags on the back of the medicine
Distributed and peddled in ghettos and
Fuck your heritage, fuck your brainwash
Detergent, Internet urgent
Time travel in purges, every man and virgin
Fuck chatterin' sermons
Fuck your church propaganda, only God know the answer
We oblige in the cope of state of manic camouflage
Like a sheep so we slide through the cancer, lies and deceit
Vibe like a Phantom, dodgin' police and paramedic retreats
Wanna fuck y'all up for tellin' me "Your life was the one I want"
Been sellin' me concepts ever since I swung
From out of the pro tongue, dedicated myself for recreation
I rest my case, won

Servin' up a look, dancin' in the drought
"Hello" to the rain man, never losin' count
Ventin' in the safe house, ventin' in the safe house
Servin' up a look, dancin' in the drought
"Hello" to the rain man, never losin' count
Ventin' in the safe house, ventin' in the safe house


Uh, yeah
Ha-ha-ha, ha, uh

I said chilling in my tipi, no Indian but he be
The realest shit, I must admit, I'm basking in my feces
My style is harder, yours is watered down, Fiji
The bible or my CD? Both of them are said to be the
Formula to live your life, or coping with the ills
No time to play kid, I think you needs to chill
House party with killers, pray for it to defill us
Where exes think it's Buffy, and chandeliers hang from ceilings
I'm dreaming, I'm scheming to be major
Composer like I'm Mozart, the sequel to Amadeus
Today is, the day I see the sun, ignoring all the rain
The fat lady has sung, octaves as high as planes
Paper by the forest tree, acres of the THC
I don't smoke but homies do, find a cloud then have a seat
Wonder how Meyer Lansky live to see 80
I just wanna see Mercedes give me head in Mercedes
'Knahmean?

And guess what?
I need all of mine's—mo' paper, mo' dough
I need all of mine's—more pussy, more hoes
I-I need all of mine's—and yeah, publishing, can't forget publishing
Nigga

Just ride, don't ask where we going (Ay)
Journey through the sky, cloud nine, no Boeing (Ay)
Baby take your time, I'ma keep it in control and
Give you what you need and give you what you want in life

I need all of mine's
I need all of mine's
I-I need all of mine's
Just ride, don't ask where we going
Journey through the sky, cloud nine, no bowing
Baby take your time, I'ma keep it in control
Give you what you need and give you what you want in life


Look inside my eyes and tell me you see a warrior
I never felt the feeling of euphoria
Pain forever or prolong the pros and cons of prosperity is strong
Wake up in the morning and I gotta win
Not taking the victory, that's my only sin
And so I send a message to your messenger
A warning shot to let em know I'm serious
I'm ready for a war, when I roar it can break a glass window
The only thing for sure: the perfect way to bend you
On your back even if I gotta slither through the cracks
I can crack every code you deliver, I attack
Every hole where the bomb squad sit it on the tripod
Even if you try hard, he can still die hard
Run but you can't hide: white flags
You can pull em out fast and tell me your last goodbye

I will, I will climb the highest mountain
Before the flood comes
And all my fight is drowning in blood
What I got to lose? What I got to prove?
I guess war is my love

Make sure your next move is slick, your best move is nothing
You know I take risk: dark clouds, I love it
'Cause I can hide in the mist, hop out
And crush every soldier you're with, so I'm 6 for 6
I'm sick with determination: I'll terminate ya quick
I lead the pack, I follow no rules
I see the traps, I know you're close to
Falling on your face, unload, reload
Hand me another case, explode, explode
The fire of my eyes is waiting on your demise
I know you hope your help is close by

I will, I will climb the highest mountain
Before the flood comes
And all my fight is drowning in blood
What I got to lose? What I got to prove?
I guess war is my love


[Kendrick Lamar:]
Whoo Ha!
Backpack raps with gats in it
Don't get your cap peeled by the black menace
K-Dot thoroughbred
Move like a militant soldier, on point like a pyramid
A forced to be reckoned with, fuck with the best shit
Like the strongest manure, I'm ready when you are
This is it, I'm in the lab cooking up all day
Fuck 'em up all day like a nympho
I been dope since S curl waves
Trying to convince hoes I got good hair
Knowing damn well there's chemicals there
I'm in the hood with the 17 year-olds that's on hood patrol
And they want stripes, so they shoot off bikes
And you know any moment you can lose your life
So kiss your kids and hug your wife, and what not yo
I spar with a dragon, he tried to throw a flame
But I ducked, then I stabbed him and came out the battle laughin'
That's a metaphor for any rapper who wants it
I smack 'em til their nose is running
You know the hoes is coming if I'm there
And the hoes is cumming once we hit the hotel
There's no assumptions
Cool out before I move out, hop on the 105
Do about 105 before your ass gets threw out the back seat
(There's a dead guy on the freeway)
Oh, It's not Dot? Tell the medics it's okay
A beast when the beat break
You probably think I'm dope like this the realest shit I wrote
But to me, it's a throw-away
I stare at the four walls and rap like I'm mad at God
Nice enough to throw a spear at Nas
Launch at Jay, matter fact, let me take that back
See I don't fuck with real legends in rap like you do
I'm crucial, concealed by real crips and suwoo
And they shoot like photography students when beef gets to brewing

Is it real, son? Is it really real, son?
Is it really real, son? Is it really real?
Tell me how you feel, son. Tell me how you feel, son
Tell me how you feel, son. Tell me how you feel
You rappers got nothing for me when Sound-Sounwave record me
Every MC, I'm sure to rip them, I guarantee you will forgive them

[Ab-Soul:]
Come again, no introduction, you know my name
Soul brother, Dueces suck the juice from my ding-a-ling
Orangutan arms banging niggas like a set
When I speak, they fucking silent like sex for the deaf
Violence, I play it like violins in the orchestra
Treat you like vitamins then spit you back out
Like a verse I had way back before I had it mapped out
Rip a page out the Almanac then cross reference when I wreck shit
I wish jaw bone fractures on all of you rappers bumping your gums
Like the measles when the record meets the needle
Heads spinning like a twelve-inch, Smoking the best Celtic
Like I shot Larry Bird, follow my word
Big Herb, I'll with it, I need a hospital gown
You need 54 cards, deal with it
You may think I'm killing it, but I'm healing it
Like a bitch in the club, Shoe game

[Punch:]
Ay yo yo, the flow potent
Who's more focused? Kick doors open
Deliver the golden opus leave with two guns smoking
It's me, the podium closing, a poet well-spoken
The gropes is most consistent with imminent penmanship
Mind-bending, co-existing with the written
Verbal assassin, Internally smashing, Spazzing on tracks
Translation, I'm disgusting in action
A lyrical glutton busting over Sounwave productions
Y'all don't want nothing, The sum of all fears
Mercury rising, I'm summer all year
I sixteen 'em to death and wish them the best
I guess that's the gift and a curse, You see my pattering
Y'all still rapping like that's what's happening
I write rhymes with fire on stone tablets
Peep the malice, I'm a monster
Ya Boy running like William Joseph Crawford touche

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Is it real, son? Is it really real, son?
Is it really real, son? Is it really real?
Tell me how you feel, son. Tell me how you feel, son
Tell me how you feel, son. Tell me how you feel
You rappers got nothing for me when Sound-Sounwave record me
Every MC, I'm sure to rip them, I guarantee you will forgive them

Straight up, Don't get ate up
Put rappers in quicksand, Dot leaned on 'em like kickstands
I'm so hot, kids put me in their iPod
Even atheists play my shit and say, "My God, Jesus, Joseph, and Mary, he's nice"
Don't compare me to them, just compare me to Mike Jordan
When I record and the verse and the chorus is ill
You can land in lab of fortune when biting my skills, playa'
Watch I lay-up bar after bar like I'm trying to build a gate up
See me on the way up like an elevator, I'mma let you take the stairs
That metaphor meaning I'm already there (Greatness)
I'm in the booth with an apron
Cooking up shit like Martha Stewart was my bitch, Amen
Stay on the curb like a spray day tan?
Blowing herb with my nigga Herb, Fuck what you niggas heard
We the new West Coast Wu Tang bitch and I'm the best
Think less, You can suck my dick
Who from the West can kill it like us? Give me their name
Now I take 'em to the house of pain, Top Dawg headquarters

Is it real, son? Is it really real, son?
Is it really real, son? Is it really real?
Tell me how you feel, son. Tell me how you feel, son
Tell me how you feel, son. Tell me how you feel
You rappers got nothing for me when Sound-Sounwave record me
Every MC, I'm sure to rip them, I guarantee you will forgive them


[The Sylvers (Kendrick Lamar):]
Pillars of joy can be found
Through the thought of you
I'll be troubled and bustled and scorned for your love
(Canei Finch on the beat)
(Turn the headphones up, Ali)
(Here we go)

[Kendrick Lamar:]
I woke up this morning with my dick on hard
Didn't know why 'til I said fuck all y'all
Or fuck this world, or I'mma fuck that girl
Good kid, m.A.A.d city, watch my day unfurl
I put my life in these sentences
Fucking right, it's either that or life sentences
I'm relatives with Benjamin
I used to give a fuck about my luck when I was innocent
Now what the fuck is up? I'm at your neck like a Pendleton
Nigga, I need that, bitch, I need that
Twenty-four acres and a mule, best believe that
They say he got smoke, like where the weed at?
And everything you hope, bitch nigga, we that
Pockets on Kelly Price back when it was '95
Buy a strap and then we cock it back when it's uncircumcised
Write a rap on how we just react when shotty hit the spine
Give you dap and then we slide through your hood three dozen times
So what's good? I'm looking for a pedicure
Pink pussy that pop, preferably the kind that don't stink
Bomb-ass head 'til she can't blink
And her eyes get watery, you gotta pardon me

I'm so damn turned
Wheeling in a two-door with two hoes that follow me
And you know, Westside, right on time, tell 'em hoes kudos
Eastside, right on time, they don't fuck with you though
When my hood getting to the money, the pedal never broke
Came a long way from the ghetto, dog, but
Westside, right on time, only thing for sure
Eastside, right on time, gunning through your door

[Young Jeezy:]
I woke up this morning like fuck the world
Been hustling since I was twelve, man, I've been through hell
Now these motherfuckers is trying to tell me I don't care
Trying to tell y'all motherfuckers, look, y'all wasn't there
Turned, posted up on the block, waiting for mail
From my niggas posted up in the county, praying for bail
Could've cost your boy everything, man, it wasn't cheap
Coming for a nigga, just don't sleep, shit for the weak
Got on my Malcolm X frames, now I count the check, mane
'Cause every time I speak, you hear my Malcolm X pain
Now them doors go up on that Lamb, they like judo
Young, you like your bitches with ass? I like you, hoe!
First, them bitches see me, I'm gone, I'm like Pluto
Plus, I keep them choppers that sing, they Mars Bruno
Brown bag full of cash, baby, MCM
When they ask me my name, I tell 'em MC him, straight up

[Kendrick Lamar:]
I'm so turned
Wheeling in a two-door with two hoes that follow me
And you know, Westside, right on time, tell 'em hoes kudos
Eastside, right on time, they don't fuck with you though
When my hood getting to the money, the pedal never broke
Came a long way from the ghetto, dog, but
Westside, right on time, only thing for sure
Eastside, right on time, gunning through your door

All praise go to the most high
All fades turn into a drive-by
Part ways from the streets, after fucking with police guaranteed
Last nigga did that died, don't you, don't you, don't you
Wanna live where the AK go for only 8K
Minus six racks, minus one on top of that?
Melee, stomp him out then drug him out like a date rape
Daytonas bending every corner while they say

I'm so turned
Wheeling in a two-door with two hoes that follow me
And you know, Westside, right on time, tell 'em hoes kudos
Eastside, right on time, they don't fuck with you though
When my hood getting to the money, the pedal never broke
Came a long way from the ghetto, dog, but
Westside, right on time, only thing for sure
Eastside, right on time, gunning through your door

All I ever wanted was a dollar bill and hundreds
And my teacher as my woman, when she smiled, I stick my tongue in
Plus some cartoons and some cereal, Snoop Doggy on my stereo
Some British Knights or LA Gears with glowing lights or Perry Ellis jacket
I would love a swap meet full of Chevrolets in candy paint
That's wet with Tammy on the bumper, can I hump her? Poppa tell me yes
A DPGC concert and a DJ Quik song on cassette
Twenty years later: hi hater, I'm the fucking best

I'm so turned
Wheeling in a two-door with two hoes that follow me
And you know, Westside, right on time, tell 'em hoes kudos
Eastside, right on time, they don't fuck with you though
When my hood getting to the money, the pedal never broke
Came a long way from the ghetto, dog, but
Westside, right on time, only thing for sure
Eastside, right on time, gunning through your door


I return before tables get turned
It's my turn, spur of the moment
They reproduce my sperm and try to clone it
Stand firm, bumping the The Firm 'Phone Tap', I'm on it
I slaughter every opponent to bits of components, potent
You can't fuck with the horse power, you're woofing too much
You're bout to go hoarse coward as soon as I buss, pause
You put your hands on a broad, then telling me you can brawl
You thought you saw me when you saw 'Saw', frightening
More reckless than a paisa driving without license
Hitting your new truck, then leaving you hiking
They said no, the industry let it go
I cracked the window, they hit the back door like trick dices
Sticking and moving, and moving and sticking the prices
Upping the ante before I'm an antique
I promise you'll hear me clear, even if you need three ears with Tyson
Gripping the panties, big booty, no whammies, they dyking
I'm liking them all, I'm sifting through panties, haters will spike it
Voicing opinions, but holding laryngitis
But I don't hear 'em, I'm a winner by law
Track 'em down like a subway when they sub-par
Sub-zero every time I jump in the synagogue
Send an angel, send a God, I don't make it look hard, I know
I just let the thoughts take its toll
More 'sentences' than Level IV yard
Bogard, go hard, black tar, concrete
Tom Vick, times Papi Mason, times three
Uncle Toms need toms to stomach atomic bombs, or die from my Wizardry
RZA, GZA, Method Man, I'm a 'Killa Bee'
Killer be killed, make your embassy yield
This is not your cup of tea, and oh
They say waters run deep
Dive in Bermuda triangles and you'll see us
We must, dust behind, emcee's duck
Deduct, revenue decline when we touch-
Down like a running back's grind, can you keep up?
You keep a safe for keep-safe? That ain't safe, bla!
Compton


[Kendrick Lamar:]
Said I'm a fucking monster
A massive attack will haunt ya
Mastered the rap then fucked up the monitors mastered that
After that I went for thermometers
Popped them all then popped them in the jar
Tracy veronica holler back
They promise there's no pajamas
Insomnia when attack I attack like piranha
There's hit your block like a comet
And you all know what time it is 2012 mark your calendars
Calisthenics and silence is exercise
And that trigger strapped
Rock with us Metallica competition
No talent I'm in the jungle
Loud enough just might stumble
Upon a pack of lions no lying
My soldiers dying
This is like rap alliance is lining with
Stars and bars of a prison wrapped my science applying
Pressure a stretcher is needed paint prosthese of your living dead
Your stuff is a giga pet
You niggas can't see me unless you watching that TV
I'll hold your hug in my silhouette
My flow got the ceiling wet
I spit 'til I feel my breath start stinking my fucking chest
She fucking the fucking best mean my dick is the dick of death
Mean I'm killing that pussy like spike whenever that jerry slip

Yeah Dre
Me and Andre the giant 6'7" and climbing
Whether your storm to your climbing
Whether your beat making a rhyme and
Bumping some feelings huh man with a handful of diamonds like jay fans on an island with ray bans
Glasses, palmin' asses that probably came with a great tan
I'll be the motherfucking mecca of this hub city spectrum
Where they at I will dissect them like a fucking frogs rectum
While you're wrecking with irreputable my words so incredible
Probably call the federal after I slaughter several
Etcetera etcetera barely passing up Celicas
Telling us about shit
Hiii power in your mouth bitch
And top dawg can vouch bitch
Nigga what you 'bout
About face and army outfits the general's head
Means the hustlers and the criminals there
Pinnotens reach the pinnacle of life in despair
And me I solemnly swear
To handle mine like a Taliban and die for it
Only difference is I ain't never asking Allah for it
Only difference is I be spazzing and still a pow for it
Put me in a category
I don't know what's a sadder story
Guts and glory your pain bore me
You ain't really lived it
I'll take you to a block where they cripping
A piru that's 5'2" gun bigger than the torso of pippen
Bitch I been doing it since before you niggas ruined it
Show me something different
You either kissing dick or giving me distance
You live in a district of dime bags and dummies
I know your statistics
Who your bar he more like my assistant
Get lost have an egg and a biscuit
Break-fast when we aiming them biscuits
Pay cash when your chain come up missing
Q, Q

[ScHoolboy Q:]
Ah, double up said what the fuck
Give me some I'll throw more popping
Sagrets dropping soon they watching
9s that's locked and load explode
Drugging ford I'm slowly known
Mary up some swisher sweets
LA nigga probably eats
Shrimp for the raging beats
XO, Henney, scrape the kief
Banging c I'll bang your beat
Put them niggas next to me
Stopping for them give the lead
I'm here now let the hardest speak
All them dudes got ovaries, period, run on sentence
Still I'm venting
Air condition coolest breezes, ill diseases
Grip my pen and shoot my semen
Still I'm coming
Mouths is running
I was learning getting knowledge
And describing she a goblin
We be mobbing over bitches
Sticking missus she the business
Ghetto witness pussy frenching
Just a mission popping off like on a mission
Proposition getting money drop a nigga
Rush a nigga, stomp a nigga, crush a nigga, dust a nigga
Cop a head gon' bust nigga
Heating up the winter nigga
Something to remember nigga
Hella sick I gotta spit
Curse with a verse like God told me kill this shit
Load a clip Hecklin cops
The Hoover king
Ba da bing by the dingaling
Natural Hoover
Ving rhames with a vision clearer than Visine
Asian from Beijing
Money making Compton cream
Feed a weak that's when it stop
Start with rain drops
Autobots, space shuttle I'm shitting on your car lot
Boy stop
Could've at least got a Saturn huh
Hiii power see a pattern huh
Putting on chops like I've never been freed
Toon to the knees still I'm shooting up scenes
Cheese and a nigga thoughts succeed
Promising scenes ba da bing bing bing
