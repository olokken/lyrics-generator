If I were a boy
Even just for a day
Id roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
Id kick it with who I wanted
And Id never get confronted for it
Cause theyd stick up for me

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear Id be a better man
Id listen to her
Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
Cause hes taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone its broken
So theyd think that I was sleepin alone
Id put myself first
And make the rules as I go
Cause I know that shed be faithful
Waitin for me to come home
To come home

If I were a boy
I think I could understand, oh-ooh
How it feels to love a girl
I swear Id be a better man
Id listen to her
Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted (Wanted)
Cause hes taken you for granted (Granted)
And everything you had got destroyed

Its a little too late for you to come back
Say, its just a mistake
Think Id forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong
But youre just a boy
You dont understand (Yeah, you dont understand, oh)
How it feels to love a girl
Someday, youll wish you were a better man
You dont listen to her
You dont care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
Cause youve taken her for granted
And everything you have got destroyed
But youre just a boy67Embed

Maybe its a cause for concern, but Im not at ease
Keeping my head to the curb

Pray to catch you whispering

Give you some time to prove that I can trust you again
Im gonna kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you

All night long
Love all night long
Sweet love all night long
Sweet love all night long
All I wanna, aint no other
We together, I remember
Sweet love all night long

They say true loves the greatest weapon
To win the war caused by pain, pain
But every diamond has imperfections
But my loves too pure to watch it chip away
Boy, nothing real can be threatened
True love breathes salvation back into me
With every tear came redemption
And my torturer became my remedy
So many people, I know that theyre just tryna touch ya
Kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you
Give you some time to prove that I can trust you again
Im gonna kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you

All night long
Love all night long
Sweet love all night long
Sweet love all night long
All I wanna, aint no other
We together, I remember
Sweet love all night long

Part II: Flawless
We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller
We say to girls: You can have ambition, but not too much
You should aim to be successful, but not too successful
Otherwise, you will threaten the man
Because I am female, I am expected to aspire to marriage
I am expected to make my life choices always keeping in mind that marriage is the most important (C-Candy on the ground)
Now, marriage can be a source of joy and love and mutual support (Dum-da-dee-da)
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage and we dont teach boys the same? (Do-da-da, do-do, do-do-do-da)
We raise girls to see each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments, which I think can be a good thing (Com-com-comin down, drippin candy on the ground)
But for the attention of men
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings in the way that boys are (Dum-da-de-da)
Feminist: A person who believes in the social, political, and economic equality of the sexes (Do-da-da, do-do, do-do-do-da)
You wake up (Flawless), post up (Flawless)
Riding round in it (Flawless), flossin on that (Flawless)
This diamond (Flawless), my diamond (Flawless)

My daddy taught me how to love my haters
My sister told me I should speak my mind
My man make me feel so goddamn fine, Im flawless
You wake up (Flawless), post up (Flawless)
Riding round in it (Flawless), flossin on that (Flawless)

Listen
To the song here in my heart
A melody I start
But cant complete

Listen
To the sound from deep within
Its only beginning
To find release

Oh, the time has come for my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside and turned
Into your own, all cause you wont
Listen

Listen, I am alone at a crossroads
Im not at home in my own home
And Ive tried and tried to say whats on my mind
You should have known, oh
Now Im done believin you
You dont know what Im feelin
Im more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now Ive gotta find my own

You should have listened
There was someone here inside
Someone I thought had died
So long ago

Oh, Im screamin out and my dreams will be heard
They will not be pushed aside or worked
Into your own, all cause you wont
Listen

Listen, I am alone at a crossroads
Im not at home in my own home
And Ive tried and tried to say whats on my mind
You should have known, oh
Now Im done believin you
You dont know what Im feelin
Im more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now Ive gotta find my own

I dont know where I belong
But Ill be moving on
If you dont, if you wont
Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start, but I will complete, oh oh
Now Im done believin you
You dont know what Im feelin
Im more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you think you gave to me
But now Ive gotta find my own

I made you cry when I walked away, oh
And although I promised that I couldnt stay, baby
Every promise dont work out that way, oh, babe
Every promise dont work out that way

Dishes smashed on my counter from our last encounter
Pictures snatched out the frame
Bitch, I scratched out your name and your face
What is it about you that I cant erase, baby?
When every promise dont work out that way, no, no, babe
When every promise dont work out that way

And your heart is broken cause I walked away
Show me your scars and I wont walk away, oh
And I know I promised that I couldnt stay, baby
Every promise dont work out that way, no, no, no, no, no
Every promise dont work out that way29Embed

Ten times out of nine, I know youre lying
But nine times out of ten, I know youre trying
So Im trying to be fair
And youre trying to be there and to care
And youre caught up in your permanent emotions
And all the loving Ive been giving goes unnoticed
Its just floating in the air, lookie there
Are you aware youre my lifeline, are you tryna kill me?
If I wasnt me, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty, enough?
I dont care about the lights or the beams
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, skin thick, too tough, mmm

Cause you, you, you, you and me could move a mountain
You, you, you, you and me could calm a war down
You, you, you, you and me could make it rain now
You, you, you, you and me could stop this love drought

Nine times out of ten, Im in my feelings
But ten times out of nine, Im only human
Tell me, what did I do wrong?
Feel like that question has been posed, Im movin on
I always been committed, I been focused
I always paid attention, been devoted
Tell me, what did I do wrong?
Oh, already asked that, my bad
But you my lifeline, think you tryna kill me
If I wasnt B, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty, enough?
I dont care about the lights or the beams
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, them old bitches so wack

Ms. Third Ward, your first question:
What is your aspiration in life?
Oh, well, my aspiration in life would be
To be happy

Mama said, Youre a pretty girl
Whats in your head, it doesnt matter
Brush your hair, fix your teeth
What you wear is all that matters

Just another stage
Pageant the pain away
This time, Im gonna take the crown
Without fallin down, down, down

Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatevers worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatevers worst
We try to fix something
But you cant fix what you cant see
Its the soul that needs a surgery

Blonder hair, flat chest
TV says bigger is better
South Beach, sugar-free
Vogue says thinner is better

Just another stage
Pageant the pain away
This time, Im gonna take the crown
Without fallin down, down, down

Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatevers worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
(Pretty hurts)
Pretty hurts (Pretty hurts)
We shine the light on whatevers worst
We try to fix something
But you cant fix what you cant see
Its the soul that needs the surgery

Aint got no doctor or pill that can take the pain away
The pains inside and nobody frees you from your body
Its the soul, its my soul that needs surgery
(Its my soul that needs surgery)
Plastic smiles and denial can only take you so far
Then you break when the fake façade leaves you in the dark
Youre left with shattered mirrors and the shards of a beautiful past
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatevers worst (Pretty hurts)
Perfection is a disease of a nation (Pretty hurts)
Pretty hurts (Pretty hurts)
We shine the light on whatevers worst
Tryna fix something (Pretty hurts)
But you cant fix what you cant see
Its the soul that needs a surgery

When youre alone all by yourself (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
And youre lyin in your bed (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
Reflection stares right into you (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
Are you happy with yourself? (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
You stripped away the masquerade (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
The illusion has been shed (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
Are you happy with yourself? (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
Are you happy with yourself? (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
Yeah, yes (Ah, ah, ah)196Embed

The winner is: Beyoncé Knowles, female pop vocalist
I would like to thank the judges for picking me
My parents who I love, I love you, Houston
And Ive been driftin off on knowledge
Catcalls on catwalks, man, these women gettin solemn
I could sing a psalm for a Solomon or Salamander
We took a flight at midnight and now my mind cant help but wonder, How come?
Spoon-fed pluralized eyes to find the beaches in the forest
When Im lookin off the edge, I preach my gut, it cant help but ignore it
Im climbin up the walls cause all the shit I hear is borin
All the shit I do is borin, all these record labels borin
I dont trust these record labels, Im torn

And right before he died, he said, Remember...

He said, Take care of your mother
Watch out for your sister
Thats when Daddy looked at me

With his gun, with his head held high, he told me not to cry
Oh, my daddy said shoot

With his right hand on his rifle, he swore it on the bible
My daddy said shoot (Yee)

There was a time I thought
That you did everything right
No lies, no wrong
Boy, I mustve been out of my mind

So when I think of the time that I almost loved you
You showed your ass and I, I saw the real you
Thank God you blew it
I thank God I dodged the bullet
Im so over you, so baby, good looking out

I wanted you bad, Im so through with that
Cause honestly, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
You turned out to be the best thing I never had
And Im gon always be the best thing you never had
I bet it sucks to be you right now

So sad, youre hurt
Boo hoo, oh, did you expect me to care?
You dont deserve my tears
I guess thats why they aint there

To think that there was a time that I almost loved you
You showed your ass, and baby, yes, I saw the real you
Thank God you blew it
I thank God I dodged the bullet
Im so over you, baby, good looking out

I wanted you bad, Im so through with that
Cause honestly, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
I said, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
And Ill never be the best thing you never had
Oh, baby, I bet it sucks to be you right now

I know you want me back
Its time to face the facts
That Im the one thats got away
Lord knows that it would take another place, another time
Another world, another life
Thank God, I found the good in goodbye
I used to want you so bad, Im so through with that
Cause honestly, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
Oh, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
And I will always be the best thing you never had
Ooh, best thing you never had
I used to want you so bad, Im so through with that

All the ladies, if you feel me, help me sing it out
Here you go, trippin
Everything is cool between us, Bey
I told you that
Out on the road wit my people, just doin what I gotta do
There’s nothin goin on that shouldnt be goin on
You got to trust me, ma

I cant believe I believed everything we had would last
So young and naive of me to think she was from your past
Silly of me to dream of one day havin your kids
Love is so blind, it feels right when its wrong

I cant believe I fell for your schemes, Im smarter than that
So dumb and naive to believe that with me, youre a changed man
Foolish of me to compete when you cheat with loose women
It took me some time, but now I moved on
Because I realized Ive got

Me, myself, and I
Thats all I got in the end
Thats what I found out
And it aint no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on, Im gon be my own best friend
Me, myself, and I
Thats all I got in the end
Thats what I found out
And it aint no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on, Im gon be my own best friend

Youre so controlling, you say that you love me but you dont
Your family told me one day I would see it on my own
Next thing I know, Im dealing with your three kids in my home
Love is so blind, it feels right when its wrong

Now that its over, stop callin me
Come pick up your clothes
Aint no need to front like youre still with me
All your homies know
Even your very best friend tried to warn me on the low
Took me some time, but now I am strong
Because I realized Ive got

Me, myself, and I
Thats all I got in the end
Thats what I found out
And it aint no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on, Im gon be my own best friend
Me, myself, and I

I wish I could believe you, then Ill be alright

Lovin you was easy once upon a time
But now, my suspicions of you have multiplied
And its all because you lied
I only give you a hard time
Cause I cant go on and pretend like
I havent tried to forget this
But Im much too full of resentment
Just cant seem to get over the way you hurt me
Dont know how you gave another who didnt mean a thing (Mean a thing), no

It was sacrificed (Sacrificed)

I only give you a hard time

I know she was attractive, but I was here first
Been ridin with you for six years
Why did I deserve to be treated this way by you?
I know youre probably thinkin, Whats up with B?
I been cryin for too long, what did you do to me?
I used to be so strong, but now you took my soul
Im cryin, cant stop cryin, cant stop cryin
You couldve told me you wasnt happy
I know you didnt wanna hurt me
But look what youve done to me now
I gotta look at her in her eyes (You lied)

She was lost in so many different ways
Out in the darkness with no guide
I know the cost of a losing hand
There but for the grace of God go, I

I found Heaven on earth
You are my last, my first
And then I hear this voice inside
Ave Maria

Ive been alone when Im surrounded by friends
How could the silence be so loud?
But I still go home knowing that Ive got you
Theres only us when the lights go down

You are my Heaven on earth
You are my hunger, my thirst
I always hear this voice inside
Singing Ave Maria

Sometimes, love can come and pass you by
While youre busy making plans
Suddenly hit you and then you realize
Its out of your hands, baby, you got to understand

You are my Heaven on earth
You are my last, my first
And then I hear this voice inside
Ave Maria

I, I, I left no time to regret
Kept my dick wet with that same old bet
Oh, and you, you and your head high
And your tears dry
Get on without your guy
And I, I, I went back to what I knew
So far removed from all we been through
Oh-oh, and you, and you, and you, you tread a troubled track
Your odds are always stacked
Youll go back to black

We only said goodbye with words
I know a hundred times
I go back to her and you go back to
You go back to

I, I love you much
Its not enough
I love blow and you love puff
And life is like a pipe
And Im a tiny penny rolling up the walls inside

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her and I go back to
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her and I go back to
I go back to black17Embed
I dont have a reason to cry
And I have every reason to smile
I dont have a reason to lie
When you’re already reading my mind
And I don’t have a reason to be, if I can’t be with you
And I dont need air in my lungs, if I can’t sing your song
No, I don’t need hands if I don’t get to keep you warm
And I don’t really need myself, if I dont need you

Cause darling I wake up just to sleep with you
I open my eyes so I can see with you
And I live so I can die with you

And I don’t really need these fingers, if I don’t get to touch your spine
Well, I don’t need these legs, if I ain’t walking by your side
And I don’t really need to be if I can’t be with you

Cause darling I wake up just to sleep with you
I open my eyes so I can see with you
And I live so I can die with you
Cause darling I wake up just to sleep with you
I open my eyes so I can see with you
And I live so I can die with you

I tried to change
Closed my mouth more
Tried to be soft, prettier
Less... awake
Fasted for 60 days
Wore white
Abstained from mirrors
Abstained from sex
Slowly did not speak another word
And that time my hair I grew past my ankles
I slept on a mat on the floor
I swallowed a sword
I levitated
Into the basement
Confessed my sins
And was baptized in a river
Got on my knees and said, Amen
And said, I mean
I whipped my own back
And asked for dominion at your feet
I threw myself into a volcano
I drank the blood and drank the wine
I sat alone and begged and bent at the waist for God
I crossed myself in thought
I saw the devil
I grew thickened skin on my feet
I bathed in bleach
And plugged my menses with the pages from the holy book
But still inside me coiled deep was the need to know
Are you cheating?
Are you cheating on me?1Embed
Aw baby, how you doin?
You know Im gonna cut right to the chase, huh?
Some women were made...
But me, myself?
I like to think that I was created
For a special purpose
And, uh
Whats more special than you?
You feel me?

Its on, baby, lets get lost
You dont need to call in to work cause youre the boss
For real, want you to show me how you feel
I consider myself lucky, thats a big deal
Why?
Well, you got the key to my heart
But you aint gonna need it
Id rather you open up my body
And show me secrets you didnt know was inside
No need for me to lie

Its too big (Big)
Its too wide (Wide)
Its too strong (Strong)
It wont fit (Fit)
Its too much (Much)
Its too tough (Tough)
He talk like this cause he can back it up
He got a big ego
Such a huge ego
I love his big ego
Its too much
He walk like this cause he can back it up

Usually Im humble
Right now, I dont choose
You can leave with me
Or you could have the blues
Some call it arrogant
I call it confident
You decide when you find out what Im working with
Damn, I know
Im killing you with them legs
Better yet, them thighs
Matter of fact its my smile, or maybe my eyes?
Boy, you a sight to see
Kinda something like me

Its too big (Big)

Let the motherfucking beat build in this bitch
About that

I thought that things like this get better with time
But I still need you
Why is that?
Youre the only image in my mind
So I still see you around

I miss you, like everyday
Wanna be with you, but youre away
I said I miss you, missing you insane
But if I got with you, could it feel the same?

The words dont ever seem to come out right
But I still mean em
Why is that?
It hurts my pride to tell you how I feel
But I still need to
Why is that?

I miss you, like everyday
Wanna be with you, but youre away
I said I miss you, missing you insane
But if I got with you, could it feel the same?

It dont matter who you are
It is so simple
A feeling
But its everything
No matter who you love
It is so simple
A feeling
But its everything

I miss you, like everyday
Wanna be with you, but youre away (But youre away)

See me up in the club with fifty-eleven girls
Posted in the back, got my fangs in my grill
Brooklyn brim with my eyes sitting low
And every boy in here with me got that smoke
And every girl in here got to look me up and down
All on Instagram, cake by the pound
Circulate the image every time I come around
Gs up tell me how Im looking, babe

Boy, this all for you just walk my way
Just tell me how its looking, babe
Just tell me how its looking, babe
I do this all for you, baby, just take aim
And tell me how its looking, babe
And tell me how its looking, babe, looking, babe

Drop the bass, mayne, the bass get lower

High like treble, pumping on the mids
Ya man aint never seen a booty like this
And why you think ya keep my name rolling off your tongue
Cause when he wanna smash Ill just write another one
I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker

(Turn the lights on)

Every night, I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe Ill get a chance to see you
When I close my eyes, Im going out of my head
Lost in a fairytale, can you hold my hands and be my guide?

Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains, youre the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?

You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way, I dont wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your loves too good to be true

My guilty pleasure, I aint going nowhere
Baby, long as youre here, Ill be floating on air
Cause youre mine
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I dont wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)

I mention you when I say my prayers
I wrap you around all of my thoughts
Boy, you my temporary high
I wish that when I wake up, youre there
To wrap your arms around me for real
And tell me youll stay by my side

Clouds filled with stars cover the skies (Cover the skies)
And I hope it rains, youre the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?

You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way, I dont wanna wake up from you

Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your loves too good to be true

I appreciate the love and dedication from you to me
Later on in my destiny, I see myself having your child
I see myself being your wife, and I see my whole future in your eyes
The thought of all my love for you sometimes makes me wanna cry
I realize all my blessings, Im grateful to have you by my side

I am in love with you, you set me free

Dangerously in love

Know there was something that meant something that I left behind
When I leave this world, Ill leave no regrets
Leave something to remember, so they wont forget

And it was more than I thought it would be
I will leave my mark so everyone will know

And know that I meant something in somebodys life
The hearts I have touched will be the proof that I leave
That I made a difference, and this world will see

Youre everything I thought you never were
And nothing like I thought you couldve been
But still, you live inside of me
So tell me how is that?
Youre the only one I wish I could forget
The only one Id love to not forgive
And though you break my heart, youre the only one

And though there are times when I hate you
Cause I cant erase
The times that you hurt me
And put tears on my face
And even now while I hate you
It pains me to say
I know Ill be there at the end of the day

I dont wanna be without you, babe
I dont want a broken heart
Dont wanna take a breath without you, babe
I dont wanna play that part
I know that I love you
But let me just say
I dont wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no
I dont want a broken heart
And I dont wanna play the broken-hearted girl, no, no
No broken-hearted girl
Im no broken-hearted girl

Something that I feel I need to say
But up to now, Ive always been afraid
That you would never come around
And still I wanna put this out
You say youve got the most respect for me
But sometimes I feel youre not deserving me
And still youre in my heart
But youre the only one

And yes, there are times when I hate you
But I dont complain
Cause Ive been afraid that you would walk away
Oh, but now I dont hate you
Im happy to say
That I will be there at the end of the day

I dont wanna be without you, babe
I dont want a broken heart
Dont wanna take a breath without you, baby
I dont wanna play that part
I know that I love you
But let me just say
I dont wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no
I dont want a broken heart
And I dont wanna play the broken-hearted girl, no, no
No broken-hearted girl
Now Im at a place I thought Id never be, ooh
Im living in a world thats all about you and me, yeah
Aint gotta be afraid, my broken heart is free
To spread my wings and fly away
Away with you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ohh, ohh, ohh

I dont wanna be without my baby
I dont want a broken heart
Dont want to take a breath without my baby
I dont wanna play that part

And I dont want no substitute
Baby, I swear its Déjà Vu
Know that I cant get over you
Cause everything I see is you

Im just one of, the one, nothin after me
No Déjà Vu, just me and my... (Oh!)

Without thinking that youre there
Seems like youre everywhere, its true
Gotta be having Deja Vu
Cause in my mind, I want you here
Get on the next plane, I dont care
Is it because Im missin you
That Im having Déjà Vu?

All its been paid for, and its mine
How could you look at me
And not see all the things?

So stroke my big, (eh-eh-eh), ego
I like to joke around a little bit, but here we go
Welcome to the wonderful world of gold-plated Earl, cause
Every thing I throw up, blow up
Talking to the girl She said, Know what, grow up, you nasty,
I don’t understand why they trippin’, if you ask me
Flow is just the nicest, I emit the propane
I just spit, probably just raised the gas prices
Everybody in the club try and get as fresh as me
What you want, dawg? Tryna stay recession free
And spit, refreshingly when I rock the stadium
You probably get sweaty you should bring a extra tee
Now I’m standing next to Jay who standing next to B
You coulda been anywhere in the world, but you’re here with me
That’s good for my ego, me and my ego
And it go wherever we go my ego is my imaginary friend
He was with me when I was only imagining
I had dreams of the league, one day I play Kobe
I walk up to Puff and he already know me
Coulda let the dream killers kill my self esteem
Or use the arrogance as a steam that power my dreams
And my ego

Its on baby, lets get lost
You dont need to call into work cause youre the boss
For real, want you to show me how you feel
I consider myself lucky, thats a big deal
Why? Well, you got the key to my heart
But you aint gonna need it, Id rather you open up my body
And show me secrets, you didnt know was inside
No need for me to lie

Its too big, its too wide
Its too strong, it wont fit
Its too much, its too tough
He talk like this cause he can back it up
He got a big ego, such a huge ego
I love his big ego, its too much
He walk like this cause he can back it up

Usually Im humble, right now I dont choose
You can leave with me or you could have the blues
Some call it arrogant, I call it confident
You decide when you find on what Im working with
Damn I know Im killing you with them legs
Better yet them thighs
Matter a fact its my smile or maybe my eyes
Boy you a sight to see, kind of something like me
Its too big, its too wide
Its too strong, it wont fit
Its too much, its too tough
I talk like this cause I can back it up
I got a big ego, such a huge ego
But he loves my big ego, its too much
I walk like this cause I can back it up

I, I walk like this cause I can back it up
I, I talk like this cause I can back it up

Its too much, its too tough
He talk like this cause he can back it up
He got a big ego, such a huge ego
I love his big ego, its too much
He walk like this cause he can back it up

If the storm comes
If we burn up
If the wells run dry
Youre my reason
To believe in
Another life

If it all ends
And its over
If the sky falls fire
Best believe me
You will see me
On the other side

If we wake up
Lose our patience
Or even lose our lives, oh
Ill feel lucky
To say that youve been
A friend of mine

Best believe me
You will see me
On the other side

Mama, I understand your many sleepless nights
When you sit and you think about Father
Or how you tried to be the perfect wife

You used to dress and fix your hair
Then you smiled through your tears
In the mirror, you would stare
And say a prayer
Like, I wish he said Im beautiful
I wish it didnt hurt at all
I dont know how I got here
I was once the one who had his heart

Until you had enough then you took that ring off
You took that ring off
So tired of the lies and trying, fighting, crying
Took that ring off
Oh, now the fun begins
Dust yourself off and you love again
You found a new man, now you shine and youre fine
Like its my time, you took that ring off

Mama (So sexy), you live and learn, thats just the way life goes
(Uh, you a killer, you a killer, killer)
Always know that youve got a daughter
Thats so, so proud you took the high road
(You a killer, so sexy)

You used to dress and fix your hair
You always smiled through your tears
In the mirror, you would stare
And say a prayer
Like, I wish he said Im beautiful
I wish this didnt hurt at all
I dont know how I got here
I was once the one who had his heart

And then you had enough then you took that ring off
You took that ring off
So tired of the lies and trying, fighting, crying
Took that ring off
Oh, now the fun begins
Dust yourself off and you love again
You found a new man now you shine and youre fine
Like its my time, you took that ring off

After all your tears
After all that pains all clear
Mama, after all them years
We can start all over again
Mama, and now it all makes sense
Letting go is never the end
Mama, we can love again
This is where freedom begins
Mama, so put your love on top
You gon shine and put your love on top
Its your time to put your love on top
Everybody, put your love on top
Aye, love on top
Aye, love on top
Its your time to put your love on top
Girl, you so fine, put your love on top

If youre going through it, just know its called going THROUGH it
Youre not gonna get stuck there, youre not gonna die
Youre gonna survive66Embed

If I begged and if I cried
Would it change the sky tonight?
Would it give me some light?
Should I wait for you to call?
Is there any hope at all?
Are you driftin by?

When I think about it
I know that I was never there or even cared
The more I think about it
The less that I was able to share with you
I try to reach for you, I can almost feel you
Youre nearly here
And then you disappear (Disappear, disappear, disappear)
You disappear (Disappear, disappear, disappear)

And when I lie all by myself
I see your face, I hear your voice
My heart stays faithful
And time has come and time has passed
If its good, its got to last
It feels so right

When I think about it
I know that I was never there or even cared
The more I think about it
The less that I was able to share with you
I try to reach for you, I can almost feel you
Youre nearly here
And then you disappear (Disappear, disappear, disappear)
You disappear (Disappear, disappear, disappear)
You, you disappear
(Disappear, disappear, disappear)

I missed all the signs, one at a time
You were ready
What did I know?
Starting our lives
Now my love, Im ready to show

When I think about it
I know that I was never there or even cared
The more I think about it
The less that I was able to share with you
I try to reach for you, I can almost feel you
Youre nearly here
And then you disappear
You disappear, you disappear
You disappear, disappear12Embed
You’re bad for me
I clearly get it
I don’t see how something good could come from loving you
The death of me must be your mission
Cause with every hug and kiss, you’re snatching every bit of strength
That I’m gon need to fight off the inevitable
And it’s a heart-breakin situation I’m up in, but I can’t control

You’re just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You’re just like poison and I just don’t get it
How can something so deadly feel so right?
I’m not sure of what to do
It’s a catch 22
Cause the cure is found in you
I don’t want it, but I do
You’re just like poison
My affliction, I’m addicted, I cant lie
Kiss me one more time before I die

You aint right, take me high
Then that high, it subsides
And my body flat-lines
Then you come to revive
Wait, wait, wait, I’m alive
But how long will it last?
Will it all come crashing down?
How many doses am I needing now?
What’s the prognosis, will you be around?
Or am I just another victim of an assassin that broke my heart down?

Baby, you’re just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You’re just like poison and I just don’t get it
How can something so deadly feel so right?
I’m not sure of what to do
It’s a catch 22
Cause the cure is found in you
I don’t want it, but I do
You’re just like poison
My affliction, I’m addicted, I cant lie
Kiss me one more time before I die

It’s just not my body (no)
It’s my mind
You don’t know how many times I told myself this cant do
And that I don’t need you (no, I don’t need you, no)
It’s so unfair
That I find myself right back in your care
And what’s good is that when you’re not always there
(there, there)
Youre no good for my health, my health

You’re just like poison (whoa, whoa, whoa)
You’re just like poison (whoa, whoa, whoa)
You’re just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You’re just like poison and I just don’t get it
How can something so deadly feel so right?
I’m not sure of what to do
It’s a catch 22
Cause the cure is found in you
I don’t want it, but I do
You’re just like poison
My affliction, I’m addicted, I cant lie
Baby, kiss me one more time

You’re just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You’re just like poison and I just don’t get it
How can something so deadly feel so right?
I’m not sure of what to do

I don’t want it, do

Soon as he saw me
Turned on by how the dress was fittin right
Short and backless (Backless, backless)
See my silhouette in the moonlight
Such an attraction
Keep tellin me how my outfit’s so nice
Little did he know

Spin it all around then take it to the ground and

Im a trainwreck in the morning
Im a bitch in the afternoon
Every now and then without warning
I can be really mean towards you
Im a puzzle, yes, indeed
Ever complex in every way
And all the pieces arent even in the box
And yet, you see the picture clear as day

I dont know why you love me
And thats why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me flaws and all
And thats why I love you
And thats why I love you
And thats why I love you

I neglect you when Im working
When I need attention, I tend to nag
Im a host of imperfection
And you see past all that
Im a peasant by some standards
But in your eyes, Im a queen
You see potential in all my flaws
And thats exactly what I mean

I dont know why you love me
And thats why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me flaws and all
And thats why I love you
And thats why I love you
And thats why I love you
I dont know why you love me
And thats why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me flaws and all

I feel weak, weve been here before
Cause I feel we keep going back and forth
Maybe its over, maybe were through
But I honestly can say I still love you

Maybe we reached the mountain peak
And theres no more left to climb
And maybe we lost the magic piece
And were both too blind to find

Lets start over, lets give love their wings
Lets start over, stop fighting bout the same old thing
Lets start over, we cant let our good love die
Maybe we can start all over, give love another life

I can see that were not happy here
So why would we keep pretending when theres nothing there?
Maybe you like it, well, I dont
And maybe youll settle, well, I wont

Maybe we reached the mountain peak
And theres no more left to climb
And maybe we lost the magic piece
And were both too blind to find

Lets start over, lets give love their wings
Lets start over, stop fighting bout the same old thing
Lets start over, we cant let our good love die
Maybe we can start all over, and give love another life

I know that this will hurt you, I know youll cry
I know I called you selfish, but thats a lie
I feel I know whats best for us

Lets start over
And lets give love their wings
Lets start over, Im tired of fighting bout the same old thing
Lets start over, we both know that this love wont die
Maybe we can start all over, and give love another life9Embed

To be loved, loved
Stand for him or fall for anything
Cuz through his eyes we all look the same
What will we do without out blame
Feels like we always fall short, of bein worthy (we are not worthy)
Cuz I aint good enough, but he still loves me
I aint no superstar (I aint no superstar but I wanna be for you Lord)

You whisper softly in my ear
Makes me unwind
The way you touch me lets me know youre mine

Cause I love the way you scream my name
And theres no other man that gives me what I want
And makes me feel this way
Id rather be with you cause you hustle hard to take care of me

Boy, Id rather be with you (Boy, Id rather be with you)

I love the way you look at me
Stare into my eyes

Tonights the night your fantasies will all come true
I am your woman

Im holding back nothing
Saving it all for you
Baby, I love making love to you

So what are you gonna say at my funeral, now that youve killed me?
Here lies the body of the love of my life, whose heart I broke without a gun to my head
Here lies the mother of my children, both living and dead.
Rest in peace, my true love, who I took for granted. Most bomb pussy who, because of me, sleep evaded
Her shroud is loneliness. Her god was listening
Her heaven will be a love without betrayal
Ashes to ashes, dust to side chicksEmbed
Boy, youll be the death of me
Youre my James Dean
You make me feel like Im seventeen
You drive too fast
You smoke too much
But that dont mean a thing, cause Im addicted to the rush

Cause Id rather die young than live my life without you
Id rather not live at all than live my life without you
Cause Id rather die young than live my life without you
Id rather not live at all than live my life without you

You know Ive been in love before
Youre the first one I ever seen that burns like gasoline
So light a match, turn off the lights
Im holdin on to you cause this might be our last night, oh

Cause Id rather die young than live my life without you
Id rather not live at all than live my life without you
Cause Id rather die young than live my life without you
Id rather not live at all than live my life without you

What Im telling you
Im giving you my life, its in your hands
And what Im gonna do
Is be a woman and you can be a man
And I wanna say
Nobody understands what weve been through
Id rather give up everything
Than to live my, live my life without you, oh

Cause Id rather die young than live my life without you
Id rather not live at all than live my life without you
Cause Id rather die young than live my life without you
Id rather not live at all than live my life without you4Embed
I think Id wanna go back to school

I cant resist them butterfliesEmbed

Yeah, H-Town all stars in the building, thats right

Seven-thirteen homey, I been on
Yeah we been here and yall sho been gone
Screwed up captain, still repping the south
And cant none of yall cut me off, Im alive
Make em southside, cause thats Texas pride
Pimp C got me swangin it wide, so be quiet
Bey still repping it right for H-Town
Don Kekes draped up, chopped and screwed down

Ive been on, Ive been on
Since back when I had braids on my dome
Underground king, sitting on my throne
Me and Bey done did number one songs
Riding candy and chrome, this Texas
Could buy a Bentley cash with this necklace
This H-Town, we drive reckless
We make em bow down, they gon respect us

I been on, I been on, I been on
Tell me who gon take me off
Take me off, take me off, take me off
I been on, I been on, I been on
Tell me who gon take me off
Take me off, take me off, take me off

I am Houston, rep it hard
Cup with R, candy cars
Geto Boys, Willie D
Youre plexing with Bey, youre plexing with me
These dudes in the streets, be acting mob
But go to the pen, and be playing with them boys
They are not me, theyre carbon copies
If God got me, who gon stop me

I been on, now who you goons gon get to knock me off?
Ive been boss, been on slabs, been on paint
Been on fours homey, Ive been on drank, Ive been had bank
Twenty-five years and aint fell off yet, cause my flow that wet
You dont want no plex, they talk that sh-
The Queen Bey said you better bow down, bow down
I been on, I been on, I been on
Tell me who gon take me off
Take me off, take me off, take me off
I been on, I been on, I been on
Tell me who gon take me off
Take me off, take me off, take me off
On, I could never be off
Hit the boulevard so hard, itd never be soft
Elbows so long, looking like they reach out
Set of diamonds and gold in damn near each mouth
They call it Styrofoam City; Houston, Texas to be exact
Swangas on anything, it aint gotta be a Lac
If I say I got sixteen, it aint gotta be a rap
All them d-boys in them traps, they gotta feel that

We the big ballers and big bodies in fresh foreigners
Fresh up off the road from hustling and rap touring
While you sleeping and snoring, we creeping and pouring
BaddieBey and the Bun, baby, you cant ignore em
Represent for Port Arthur, get it right off the water
How you want it hard or soft, put in your order
Never the hesitators, shaking off all the haters
Ridin for Pimp, Screw and all the Lone Star Staters, hol up
I been on, I been on, I been on
Tell me who gon take me off
Take me off, take me off, take me off
I been on, I been on, I been on
Tell me who gon take me off
Take me off, take me off, take me off
I remember my baby hair with my dookie braids

Im in this fight and Im swingin, and my arms are getting tired
Im tryna beat this emptiness, but Im runnin out of time
Im sinkin in the sand and I can barely stand
Im lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
Im scared of lonely
I try to be patient, but Im hurtin deep inside
And I cant keep waitin, I need comfort late at night
And I cant find my way, wont you lead me home?
Cause Im lost in this dream
I need you to hold me

Im scared of lonely
And Im scared of being the only
Shadow I see along the wall
And Im scared the only heartbeat
I hear beating is my own
And Im scared of being alone
I cant seem to breathe when I am lost in this dream
I need you to hold me

Im scared of lonely
Im scared of lonely

I cry at night, cause my babys too far to be by my side
To wipe away these tears of mine, so I hold my pillow tight
To imagine you outstretch your hand, looking for mine
Cause Im lost in this dream
I need you to hold me

Im scared of lonely
And Im scared of being the only
Shadow I see along the wall
And Im scared the only heartbeat
I hear beating is my own
And Im scared of being alone
I cant seem to breathe when I am lost in this dream
I need you to hold me

I need your strength when nobody is around
Cause Im tired of this emptiness, I think Im drowning
I cant be lonely no more
And Im lost in this dream
I need you to hold me

Im scared of lonely
And Im scared of being the only
Shadow I see along the wall
And Im scared the only heartbeat

Chauffeur eavesdropping trying not to crash

I cooked this meal for you naked
So where the hell you at?
Just one shot left of this drink
In this glass, dont make me break it
I wish that you were me
So you could feel this feeling
I never broke one promise
And I know when youre not honest
Now you got me yelling, thats because Im jealous

If you keeping your promise, Im keeping mine
Oh, Im jealous
If you keeping your promise, Im keeping mine
Oh-oh, Im jealous, Im

Sometimes I want to walk in your shoes
Do the type of things that I never ever do
So I take one look in the mirror and I say to myself
Baby girl, you cant survive like this

Queen B, Im trippin
Cause Im a little insecure when your phone go off
Cause they be callin at three in the mornin
Know I do the same shit, but girl, its different
And if I cant, you cant fuck with no exes
You got me, no need for extras
You just love makin me jealous
Hangin out with your girls all night and stayin out til tomorrow
Girl, you got me all kinda crazy, sippin all on that bottle
I see you tryna flex, so mad Im drunk textin
Now Im reminiscin how we fell in love in Texas, girl, Im jealous

If you keeping your promise, Im keeping mine (Oh-woah, oh)
Oh, Im jealous (Jealous)
If you keeping your promise, Im keeping mine
Oh, Im jealous (Mine)

Sometimes I want to walk in your shoes (Yeah)
Do the type of things that I never ever do (Never do)
So I take one look in the mirror (Mirror) and I say to myself (Self)
Baby girl, you cant survive like this, no, no, no

And I hate you for your lies and your covers
And I hate us for making good love to each other
And I love making you jealous, but dont judge me
And I know that Im being hateful, but that aint nothing (Oh)
That aint nothing (Oh)
Im just jealous (Jealous)
Im just human (Human)
Dont judge me
If you keeping your promise, Im keeping mine (Dont judge me)
Oh, Im jealous
If you keeping your promise, Im keeping mine (Oh, ooh)16Embed

Rise up, rise up little woman

And Ive been drifting off on knowledge
Cat-calls on cat-walks, man these women getting solemn
I could sing a song for a Solomon or Salamander
We took a flight at midnight and now my mind cant help but wonder: How come?
Spoon-fed pluralized eyes to find the beaches in the forest
When Im looking off the edge, I preach my gut it cant help but ignore it
Im climbing up the walls cause all the shit I hear is boring
All the shit I do is boring, all these record labels boring
I dont trust these record labels, Im torn
All these people on the planet working 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
All the people on the planet working 9 to 5 just to stay alive, how come?

What goes up ghost around
Ghost around, around, around, around
What goes up ghost around

Right, ladies? Yes

I left a note in the hallway
By the time you read it, Ill be far away
Im far away
But I aint fucking with nobody
Lets have a toast to the good life
Suicide before you see this tear fall down my eyes
Me and my baby, we gon be alright
We gon live a good life
Big homie better grow up
Me and my woadies bout to stroll up
I see them boppers in the corner
They sneaking out the back door
He only want me when Im not there
He better call Becky with the good hair
He better call Becky with the good hair1Embed

Walk down

On her finger
He placed a ring
Oooh, oh

Standing there

Them promise
Til death do

Each word
Was a pain
In my heart
All I could do
All I could do
Was cry
All I could do

Losing the man
That I love
And all
I could do
Was cry

The wedding

Thrown over
Their heads
For them life
Has just begun
But mine
Is ending
Ooh

Was cry
All I could do
Was cry
I was losing
The man
That I love

When you were born, the angels sighed in delight
They never thought theyd see such a beautiful sight

Tears were shed, how we had been blessed

You make everything right, oh

You bring me back to life, back to life
You got a light inside, light inside

I remember when you used to take me on a bike ride every day on the bayou
(You remember that? We were inseparable)
And I remember when you could do no wrong
Youd come home from work and I jumped in your arms when I saw you
I was so happy to see you (I was so excited, so happy to see you)

Because you loved me, I overcome, yeah
And Im so proud of what youve become, yeah
Youve given me such security
No matter what mistakes I make, youre there for me
You cure my disappointments and you heal my pain
You understood my fears and you protected me
I treasure every irreplaceable memory and thats why
I want my unborn son to be like my daddy
I want my husband to be like my daddy
There is no one else like my daddy
And I thank you for loving me
Daddy, daddy, daddy...

I still remember the expression on your face
When you found out Id been on a date and had a boyfriend
(My first boyfriend, you shouldve seen your face)
I still remember I caught you crying cause of my tattoo
Could have said Beyoncé, I told you so
Instead you said youd get one too
(Even my mama said yall get one just like mine)

Words cant express my boundless gratitude for you
I appreciate what you do
Youve given me such security
No matter what mistakes, I know youre there for me
You cure my disappointments and you heal my pain
You understand my fears and you protected me
Treasure every extraordinary memory and thats why
I want my unborn son to be like my daddy
I want my husband to be like my daddy
There is no one else like my daddy
And I thank you for loving me

Even if my man broke my heart today
No matter how much pain Im in, I will be okay
Cause I got a man in my life that cant be replaced
For this love is unconditional, it wont go away
I know Im lucky
Know it aint easy
For men who take care of their responsibilities

Love is overwhelming
Lord, why did you pick me?
Cant stop my tears from falling
I love you so much, daddy
(Thank you, youve done so much for me. I love you, daddy.)
I get so emotional, daddy, every time I think of you
I get so emotional, daddy, every time I think of you
There is no one else like my daddy
No one else will replace my daddy2Embed
At last
My love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a song (Oh, yeah, yeah)

At last
The skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped up in clover
The night I looked at you

I found a dream
That I could speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never known (Oh, yeah)

When you smiled, you smiled (Oh)
And then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven
For you are mine at last5Embed

Satellites flashing by
Its a beautiful state were in
But how can we love in isolation?
Think how happy we can be when we just try
Were nothing like we seem
Passionate words are never spoken
You dont know how I bleed
When I leave your side

In your eyes, loves alive
Youve come untied
Cause were flashing by
Like satellites
Satellites

Take all the rules away
How can we live if we dont change?
Were always on display
Lets run and hide

In our eyes, loves alive
Weve come untied
Cause were flashing by
Like satellites

If we dont communicate
Well exist in our own space
We have all the love we need
While were apart, I cannot breathe

Theres three things I like about the summertime
Drop tops, long hot nights and summer love
Yeah
Ayo, B
Tell em what time it is
Lets go

Out of all the guys that approached me
Walkin up to me like they know me
You were the one that stayed aside
Waited a while and took your time
You dont know how impressing
Your curiosity was to me
It was the fourth day of July
Looked in my eyes and saw that I

I wanted more than just a man (man)

A gift from Virgo

I wish I could look in your eyes
And tell you how I feel right now inside
Baby, I know that its real
So real, so real, so real
How I wish I could be with you
How I wish, how I wish, how I wish I could be with you right now

Every morning, every afternoon, every night
I wanna be with you
It dont matter if we go to the park or watch a play
Stay in the hotel room all day
I just wanna be with you
I love everything about you from your old school tennis shoes
To the way you move when youre dancing with me

Do you remember our first kiss?
It wasnt long enough
Remember the first time we spent those weeks together?
They were not long enough
All of our conversations
All of your sweet pages
Theyre never long enough

When its time for me to leave
Its so hard to say goodbye
I never want to say goodbye
I never, ever want to say goodbye

One day, well make love
Finally, Ill be yours
Only you, only you, I could love you
But its too late, I already love you
I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you3Embed

Si yo fuera un chico
Solo por una vez
Yo me vestiría como quiero
Con lo que vea primero y me voy
Saldría a buscar
Chicas por montón
Mis amigos que son leales
Siempre van a acompañarme hasta el fin, cada noche a mentir

Si yo fuera un chico
Sé que podría saber
Comprender mucho mejor
Lo que es amar a una mujer
Sabría escuchar
Pues conozco el dolor
De perder a quien se quiere
Porque ignoras lo que tienes
Y quedas sin saber qué pasó

Si yo fuera un chico
Pero ves, no lo soy
Los chicos son de molde
Y nosotras somos de corazón
Se piensan que son
Los del sexo superior
Pero cuando lo queremos
Los vence nuestra seducción, seducción

Si yo fuera un chico
Sé que podría saber
Comprender mucho mejor
Lo que es amar a una mujer
Sabría escuchar
Pues conozco el dolor
De perder a quien se quiere
Porque ignoras lo que tienes
Y quedas sin saber qué pasó

Es muy tarde, ya ves, para regresar
Perdonarte otra vez, ya no lo vas a lograr
El lugar que ocupabas tú, ya no está más

Pero eres un chico
¿Qué le vas a hacer? No puedes comprender, oh
Que se siente al comprender mejor
Y amar en serio a una mujer
No sabes escuchar
No te importa el dolor
Hasta que pierdes a quien quieres
Porque ignoras lo que tienes
Y quedas sin saber qué pasó
Pero eres un chico1Embed

Came into this world, daddys little girl
And daddy made a soldier out of me
Oh, oh, oh
And daddy made me dance and daddy held my hand
And daddy liked his whiskey with his tea

We rode motorcycles
Blackjack, classic vinyl
Tough girl is what I had to be
He said, Take care of your mother
Watch out for your sister
Thats when daddy looked at me

With his gun and his head held high, he told me not to cry
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
With his right hand on his rifle, he swore it on the Bible
My daddy said shoot

All of them ended by Hollywood

You wanna touch it, yeah
Come to my place and we
We can discuss it
Hollywood, welcome to Hollywood1Embed
I lay alone awake at night
Sorrow fills my eyes
But Im not strong enough to cry
Despite of my disguise
Im left with no shoulder
But everybody wants to lean on me
I guess Im their soldier
Well, whos gonna be mine?

Whos there to save the hero
When shes left all alone
And shes crying out for help?
Whos there to save the hero?
Whos there to save the girl
After she saves the world
After she saves the world?

I bottle all my hurt inside
I guess Im living a lie
Inside my mind each day I die
What can bring me back to life?
A simple word, a gesture
Someone to say youre beautiful
Come find this buried treasure
Rainbows lead to a pot of gold

Whos there to save the hero
When shes left all alone
And shes crying out for help?
Whos there to save the hero?
Whos there to save the girl
After she saves the world (After she saves the world)
After she saves the world? (After she saves the world)
(After she saves the world)

Ive given too much of myself and now its driving me crazy
(Im crying out for help)
Sometimes I wish someone would just come here and save me
Save me from myself

Whos there to save the hero
When shes left all alone
And shes crying out for help?
Whos there to save the hero?
Whos there to save the girl
After she saves the world (After she saves the world)
After she saves the world? (After she saves the world)
(After she saves the world)
(After she saves the world)
After she saves the world1Embed
See me up in the club with fifty-eleven girls
Posted in the back, diamond fangs in my grill
Brooklyn brim with my eyes sitting low
Every girl in here with me got that smoke
Every girl in here gotta look me up and down
All on Instagram, cake by the pound
Circulate the image every time I come around
Gs up, tell me how its looking, babe

Drop the bass, mane, the bass get lower
Radio say Speed it up, I just go slower
High like treble, pumping on the mids
The man aint ever seen a booty like this
So why you think ya keep my name rolling off the tongue?
Cause when he wanna smash, Ill just write another one
I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Like, like liquor, like, like, like liquorEmbed

When he put his arms around her
He said - Julie baby, youre my flame
Thou give me fever
When we kisseth
A fever with the flaming youth, yeah
Fever, Im on fire
Fever yeah, I burn forsooth
Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said - Daddy, oh dont you dare
He gives me fever
With his kisses
A fever when he holds me tight
Fever, Im his Mrs
And Daddy, wont you treat him right?

Now that youve listened to my story
Heres the point that I have made
Chicks were born to give ya fever
Be it fahrenheit or centigrade
They give ya fever
When ya kiss em
And ever if you live and learn
Fever till you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
Fever till ya sizzle
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn

When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. We refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. So we have come to cash this check — a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice

Ive been drinking
Boy, Im drinking
Turn it, turn it
Ay, turn up!

Im so drunk in with love with her
Her double Ds spilling out my double cup
And she say champagne aint strong enough
But she never real say aint long enough
When I lift up all that Herve Leger
You see expression like its be amazing there
Whatever you do better watch my hair
Too late, oups baby, you made it there
She try to take it there
And I swerve all over in that Rolls Royce on the way to my house
And shorty been drinking like a fish all night, wanna hit it right now
No Merlot, just camel toe, slap all on my handy ball
Ok, handcuffs, aint no fan of those
But you aint gonna need any hands at all
Now dont take this as misogyny when I say take this mahogany
And let me put it all in until its hard to see
Beat it up and reverse till its hard to breathe
Ok, youre not dealing with inexperience, promise Im giving you pipe
Learn it, if I keep pouring up you keep throwing back
Shots will be in the air all night

Ive been drinking, Ive been drinking
I get filthy when that liquor get into me
Ive been thinking, Ive been thinking
Why cant I keep my fingers off it, baby?
I want you, na na
Why cant I keep my fingers off you, baby?
I want you, na na
Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feeling like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashing lights, flashing lights
You got me faded, faded, faded
Baby, I want you, na na
Cant keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you, na na
Drunk in love, I want you
Drank drank drank it

Boy, Im drinking, walking in my lassemblage
Im rubbing on it, rub-rubbing
If you scared, call that reverend
Boy, Im drinking, get my brain right
Armand de Brignac, gangster wife
New sheets, he sweat it out like washed rags, he wet it up
Boy, Im drinking, Im singing on the mic til my voice hoarse
Then I fill the tub up halfway then ride it with my surfboard
Surfboard, surfboard
Graining on that wood, graining, graining on that wood
Im swerving on that, swerving, swerving on that big body Benz
Serving all this, swerve, surfing all of this good good
Drank drank drank it
Drank drank drank it

Surfing all of this good
Drunk in lo-oooove

All night
We be all night, love, love

If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself
Hold up, stumble all in the house tryna backup all that mouth
That you had all in the car, talking bout you the baddest bitch thus far
Talking bout you be repping that 3rd, wanna see all that shit that I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood, hope you can handle this curve, uh
Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side
Aint got the time to take drawers off
On sight
Catch a charge I might, beat the box up like Mike
In 97 I bite, Im Ike Turner, turn up
Baby know I dont play, now eat the cake, Annie Mae
Said, Eat the cake, Annie Mae!
Im nauseous, for yall to reach these heights you gon need G3

Sweetness flowing like a faucet, body bangin no corset
Brothers wanna toss it but they lost cause my game made em forfeit
Slicker than a porpoise and thicker than a horses
Carmen Brown got the whole town speechless
I stick to my thesis, eyes stick to my features
Brothers try to hold but they game never reaches
And most of these cats are like the middle of peaches
I see you lookin at but what you lookin at
We in a bar , wanna twist me like a bottle cap

Im tryin to holler miss to see if you gon holler back

Your game is whack, and no, you will not get your quarter back
See this is Carmen, curves like a cul-de-sac
Skin coffee and cream, your donuts, you aint dunking that

But this is Milla, Lieutenant if youre wonderin

And Im Natheniel, (Mos Def) Mel Gibson (Sam) Danny Gloverin

But Im not hearing you, you might as well be mumb-l-in
See, I have dreams and with a man, what will become of them?
Theres not a kid out here who can make me believe
I should postpone my goals, cause he got tricks up his sleeve?
Whole bar full of cuffs and you aint locking me down

I got a warrant for ya heart, in the bed, hold the trial

Get a pardon if ya come with the sargeant now

Give the chair cause I dont care I aint feelin your style

Yo, Im tryin to get with you shorty
(But Im not feelin you)
But Im an officer shorty
(My looks are killin you)
Murder one will get you under the covers
(Game talker or manslaughter I aint feelin you brothers)

Eyes like the ocean

Ma I got some lotion
Hold ya thighs, raise em high and daddy long stroke em

Hair like forever
I swear I could do it better
Take the gun out my holster, I still pack a baretta

You brothers sweat Carmen like Patrick Ewing
But that kid

Dont waste ya time he aint worth doin
He just a sargeant, passin out tickets for parking

Chickenheads cluckin

Pitiful bulls barkin
See this is Carmen, voice sweet as Marvin
I turn out lights with the switch when Im walkin
Girls steady jealous cause they man always hawkin
Even got Lou lookin at me like he stalkin
And I got a mind too, I wouldnt bless you
If your first name was Ha-Chu, on Sunday singin gospel

You aint a dime just a nickel actin hostile
Headed for the big top and bouncin off this side show1Embed

I dried and cried all your tears
I trusted you despite my fears
And I refuse to keep on trying
Now that its over

Glad that its over
So glad that its over

Hes always laughing
And flirting with me
And you act like you dont even care
As a matter of fact
Youve been real distant lately
Acting like Im not even there
He says that you
Dont deserve a girl like me
Im starting to think that hes right

If you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me
Let this happen and it proves
That your love was never true
If you let him take me from you (Baby)
If you let him take me from you

Why is that when we go out
Out together as one big crew
I try to chill with you
Dance or whatever
And your homeboys more interested than you?
He pays more attention to me than you lately
Im tempted to pay attention too
Baby

If you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me
Let this happen and it proves
That your love was never true
If you let him take me from you (Baby)
If you let him take me from you

Boy, when I try to show some affection to you
You act like you got better things to do
When you want some loving
Thats when its cool
But baby boy, Im not a fool

If you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me (Wanted me)
Let this happen and it proves (No, no)
That your love was never true (No, no)
If you let him take me from you

If you let him take me from you
If you let him take me from you

If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me

I sometimes wish I could just be anonymous and walk down the street just like everyone else
Before I was famous I was the girl on the heel with the guitar
I was the girl who just wanted a beautiful view of the beach
And now that Im famous, its really really difficult to do very simple things
I think its the hardest thing to give up
But my mother always taught me to be strong and to never be a victim, never make excuses, never expect anyone else to provide for me things I know I can provide for myself
I have dreams, and I feel like I have a power to actually make those dreams a reality
When youre famous no one looks at you as a human anymore, you become the property of the public
Theres nothing real about it
Just look at these dazzling women
The finest representatives of our nation
Ready to reach for the stars and grab the crown
You cant put your finger on who I am
I cant put my finger on who I am
I am complicated
I grew up with a lot of conflict, and dramas, and Ive been through a lot just like everyone else
My escape was always music and Im so lucky that thats my job
But if I accomplished all of these things and had no one to share with, it would be worth nothing
You know, you need something real in order for any of this stuff to matter
You have to have something that is forever
Something thats invisible
I was brought up seeing my mother try to please and make everyone comfortable
And I always felt like it was my job to fix the problem
People pleaser, but Im no longer afraid of conflict and I dont think conflict is a bad thing
Because I know that when you grow up, when you learn a few things , youre no longer afraid of letting go, youre no longer afraid of the unknown
Youre no longer afraid of going to certain places in your body and your mind and your soul that may make you feel uncomfortable
And it all starts with if you could look at yourself in the mirror and say I like that person, you know?
If I hadnt gone through, you know, some of the painful experiences in my life, I would not be me
And I feel like my body is borrowed and this life is very temporary
I watched my friends body deteriorate and to see some one pass on so gracefully put everything into perspective
We do not value ourselves enough
Especially young people dont really appreciate how brilliant our bodies are
Ive always been very very specific and very choosy, very choosy about what I do with my body and who I want to share that with
People feel like they lose something when they get married but it doesnt have to be that way
Theres nothing more exciting than having a witness to your life
I always considered myself a feminist, although I was always afraid of that word because people put so much on it
When, honestly, its very simple
Its just when, you know, a person that believes in equality for men and women
Men and women balance each other out, and we have to get to a point where we are comfortable with appreciating each other
I have a lot of empathy for men, and the pressures that they go through and the cultures that have been created, especially for African-American men
I have the same empathy for women, and the pressures we go through
The woman has to provide so many things for their children
I consider myself a humanist
You know, everybodys not good at everything
You know, its OK to depend on someone
Its actually what were supposed to do
Were supposed to depend on each other
And when you find the person that you trust and you love
And you feel is going to respect you and take all of the shit you have and turn it around and bring out the best in you and feed you
It is the most powerful thing you can feel in your life
Happiness comes from you
No one else can make you happy
You make you happy
And one thing thats for sure:
The love I have for music, for my husband, for my child,
Is something that will last far beyond my lifeEmbed

The audacity to have me with them curtains back
Me and Bey, she about to sting, stand back

Its a no-go, my dough keep the scales tippin
Like 4-4s, like Im from the H-O-U-S-T-O-N
Blow wind, so Chicago of him
Is he the best ever? Thats the argu-a-ment
I dont make the list, dont be mad at me
I just make the hits like a factory
Im just one of one, nothin after me
No Déjà Vu, just me and my

Baby, I cant go anywhere
Without thinking that youre there
Seems like youre everywhere, its true (Yeah)
Gotta be having Deja Vu
Cause in my mind I want you here
Get on the next plane, I dont care
Is it because Im missin you

We didnt make forever
Weve each got to go our seperate way
And now were standing here, helpless
Looking for something to say
Weve been together a long time
We never thought it would end
We were always so close to each other;
You were always my friend
And its hard to say good-bye, my love
Hard to see you cry, my love
Hard to open up that door
When youre not sure what youre going for
We didnt want this to happen
But we shouldnt feel sad
We had a good life together
Just remember, remember, all the times we had
You know Ill always love you
You know Ill always care
And no matter Ill far I may go
In my heart youll always be there
And its hard to say good-bye, my love (Its so hard)
Hard to see you cry, my love (Its so hard)
Hard to open up that door
When youre not sure what youre going for
But weve got to grow
Weve got to try
Though its hard so hard
Weve got to say goodbye
(We didnt make forever, but Ill always love you)
But Ill always love you
(We didnt make forever, but Ill always love you)
But Ill always love you

When I dont have nothin to prove
Sometimes I shake my head
When Im layin down in my bed

So many opinions, so many judgments, preconceived
Its outta my character for me to feed in to ya
Give it a rest

Spend so much time with me consuming your head

Do you remember being born?
Are you thankful for the hips that cracked, the deep velvet of your mother
And her mother and her mother?
You look nothing like your mother,
You look everything like your mother.
You desperately want to look like her.
How to wear your mothers lipstick
You must wear it like she wears disappointment on her face.
Your mother is a woman,
And women like her can not be contained.
I think of lovers as trees
Growing to and from one another,
Searching for the same light.
Why are you afraid of love?
I think its not possible for someone like you.
But you are the love of my life (the love of my life)

Ten times out of nine, I know you‘re lying
But nine times out of ten, I know youre trying
So Im trying to be fair
And youre trying to be there and to care
And youre caught up in your permanent emotions
All the loving Ive been giving goes unnoticed
Its just floating in the air, lookie there
Are you aware youre my lifeline, are you tryna kill me?
If I wasnt me, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty, enough?
I dont care about the lights or the beams
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, skin thick, too tough
Cause you, you, you, you and me could move a mountain
You, you, you, you and me could calm a war down
You, you, you, you and me could make it rain now (make it rain now)
You, you, you, you and me could stop this love drought
Pt. 2 Sandcastles

If were gonna heal
We gonna start again,
You are the magician pulling me back together again,
The way you cut me in half.
Make the woman in doubt disappear.
Her heaven would be a love without betrayal.
You look nothing like your mother,
You look everything like your mother.

We built sandcastles that washed away
I made you cry when I walked away
And although I promised that I couldnt stay, baby
Every promise dont work out that way
And your heart is broken cause I walked away
Show me your scars and I wont walk away
And I know I promised that I couldnt stay, baby
Every promise dont work out that way, no no no no no
Every promise dont work out that way
There is a curse,
That will be broken.
One thousand girls raise their arms.
Now that reconciliation is possible,
If we gonna heal,
Let it be glorious.Embed
If tomorrow all the things were gone
Id worked for all my life
And I had to start again
With just my family by my side
Id thank my lucky stars, to be livin here today
Cause the flag still stands for freedom
And they cant take that away

And Im proud to be an American
Where at least I know Im free
And I wont forget the men who died
Who gave that right to me
And I gladly stand up
Next to you and defend her still today
Cause there aint no doubt I love this land
God bless the USA

From the lakes of Minnesota to the hills of Tennessee
Across the plains of Texas, from sea to shining sea
From Detroit down to Houston, to New York to L.A
Well theres pride in every American heart
And its time to make a change

That Im proud to be an American
Where at least I know Im free
And I wont forget the men who died
And who gave that right to me
And I gladly stand up, next to you and defend her still today
Cause there aint no doubt I love this land

And Im proud to be an American
Where at least I know Im free
And I wont forget the men who died
And who gave that right to me

If you search for tenderness
It isnt hard to find
You can have the love you need to live
But if you look for truthfulness
You might just as well be blind
It always seems to be so hard to give

Honesty
Is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty
Is hardly ever heard
And mostly what I need from you

I can always find someone
To say they sympathize
If I wear my heart out on my sleeve
But I dont want some pretty face
To tell me pretty lies
All I want is someone to believe

Honesty
Is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty
Is hardly ever heard
And mostly what I need from you

I can find a lover
I can find a friend
I can have security
Until the bitter end
Anyone can comfort me with promises again
I know
I know

When Im deep Inside of me
Dont be too concerned
I wont ask for nothin
While Im gone
But when I want sincerity
Tell me, where else can I turn?
Because youre the one that I depend upon

Honesty
Is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty
Is hardly ever heard
And mostly what I need from youEmbed

Endless power, with our love, we can devour

We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller
We say to girls: You can have ambition, but not too much
You should aim to be successful, but not too successful
Otherwise, you will threaten the man
We raise girls to see each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments
But for the attention of men

When Im here in your arms, I feel love in my heart, I can breathe
Not even pinching myself, I dont care, Im with you, you with me
I never wished on the star when the star aint got nothing on me
Cause I can wish you in my dreams

When I close my eyes, I feel like Im alive
Cause I can fall asleep, knowing that tonight youll be here with me
Ohh

(Let me know) If this is a dream
(Oh, oh, oh)
Then I dont wanna know (I dont wanna know)

If thats the only way to be with you, then dreaming you is where I belong
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

I think the luckiest girl in the whole wide world could be me
I get to be with the one that I love anytime I please
I feel like I can stay forever beyond eternity
Its like Im where Im supposed to be

When I close my eyes, I feel like Im alive
Cause I can fall asleep, knowing that tonight youll be here with me
Ohh

Ya lo ves, ya lo ves
Te olvidé, te olvidé

Ya lo ves, ya lo ves
Ya lo ves amor esta vez te olvidé
En el closet, en un rincón están tus cosas
Esto se acabó (se acabó)
Te juro que no te aguanto más
No te quiero ya ni como amante
Esta vez no ganarás
Te puedes marchar y no vuelvas jamás

Y si acaso piensas que esta vez voy a perdonar
Ya verás que nunca más me vuelves a engañar
Ya lárgate…

¿Qué sabes tú de mí?
No me hagas reír
Tú creías que eras imprescindible
Pero sin tu amor no voy a morirme, baby
¿Qué sabes tú de mí?
No me hagas reír
Me verás con otro hombre a mi lado
Ya lo ves traidor voy a sustituirte
A olvidar tu amor…

Ya me curé del dolor
Ya te saqué de mi corazón
Vete con ella, solos los dos
Pobre de ti, lárgate me das asco
Tú eras mi luz, pero hay amores que matan de daño
Me cansé de ti
Ya no soy aquella infeliz

Y si acaso piensas que esta vez voy a perdonar
Ya verás que nunca más me vuelves a engañar
Ya lárgate…

¿Qué sabes tú de mí?
No me hagas reír
Tú creías que eras imprescindible
Pero sin tu amor no voy a morirme, baby
¿Qué sabes tú de mí?
No me hagas reír
Me verás con otro hombre a mi lado
Ya lo ves traidor voy a sustituirte
Voy a olvidar tu amor (voy a olvidar tu amor…)

Ya no soy nada para ti (voy a olvidar tu amor…)
Alguien que no conoces (conoces…)
Lo nuestro se acabó (se acabó…)
Tanto daño al fin lo destruyó (destruyó…)
Nunca lloraré por ti (lloraré por ti)
Porque ya me cansé de ti (ya me cansé de ti)
No eres más imprescindible
Ya lo ves, ya lo ves
Te olvidé, te olvidé

You find the black tube inside her beauty case where she keeps your fathers old prison letters
You desperately want to look like her
You look nothing like your mother
You look everything like your mother
Film star beauty
How to wear your mothers lipstick
You go to the bathroom to apply your mothers lipstick Somewhere no one can find you
You must wear it like she wears disappointment on her face
Your mother is a woman and women like her cannot be contained Mother dearest, let me inherit the earth
Teach me how to make him beg. Let me make up for the years he made you wait
Did he bend your reflection?
Did he make you forget your own name? Did he convince you he was a god?
Did you get on your knees daily? Do his eyes close like doors?
Are you a slave to the back of his head?
Am I talking about your husband or your father?3Embed

Welcome to Beyoncé Homecoming 2018






Beyoncé, Beyoncé, Beyoncé, Beyoncé
Beyoncé, Beyoncé, Beyoncé, BeyoncéEmbed
I just wanna
Show you how much I appreciate you
Wanna show you how much I’m dedicated to you
Wanna show you how much I will forever be true
Wanna show you how much you got your girl feelin’ good
Wanna show you how much, how much you’re understood
Wanna show you how much, I value what you say
Not only are you loyal, you’re patient with me bay
Wanna show you how much, I really care about yo heart
I wanna show ya how much, I hate being apart
Show ya, show ya, show ya til you’re through with me
I wanna keep it how it is, so you can never say how it used to be

Loving you is really all that’s on my mind
And I can’t help but to think about it day and night
I wanna make that body rock, sit back and watch

Tonight I’m gonna dance for you (ohh ooh ohh ohhh)
Tonight I’m gonna dance for you (ohh ooh ohh ohhh)
Tonight I’m gonna put my body on your body
Boy I like it when you watch me, ah
Tonight it’s going down
I’ll be rockin’ on my babe rockin’ rockin’ on my babe
Swirlin’ on you babe swirlin’ swirlin on you babe
Baby lemme put my body on your body
Promise not to tell nobody cuz
It’s bout to go down

You’ll never need 2, cuz I will be your number 1
Them other chicks are superficial
But I know you know I’m the one
That’s why I’m all into you
Cuz I can recognize that you know that
That’s why I’m backin’ this thing back
Pop poppin’ this thing back
Drop drop drop dropping this thing back
This is for the time, you gave me flowers
For the world, that is ours
For the mulah, for the power of love
I know I won’t never ever eh-ever give you up
And I wanna say thank you in case I don’t thank you enough
A woman in the street and the freak in the you know what
Sit back sit back it’s the pre game show
Daddy you know what’s up



Hey Shawty show me that you love the way, that I do
Whatever, to show the world I’m crazy bout you
I tell them everything amazing bout you
The reason behind me saying I do
It’s hidden in the way you toot it in the air and drop it down
And give it to me dirty when nobody ain’t around
Your legs in the air and your clothes on the ground
And your head in the pillow, trying to hold in the sound
Now come here Shawty, let me grab and hold that
Remote control that, I love to rock when you you there for me
I want you to know that, when you undressing
It’s like I’m living out a fantasy
Cause you so soft, and I’m not that
You want this, well you got that
Magnum lifestyle, know I’m bout that
That Bentley, lay you on top that
Knock that ass from here to tomorrow
On the balcony, out in Cabo
Know a shopping spree will follow
I’m in love, watching you model
Couple candle lights, create the ambiance
And yo lingerie and yo Louis Vuitton
Pussy sick and slow music on
And I’m watching you like it’s a movie yo

Oye, lo que tengo que decir
No puedo ya seguir viviendo así
Oye (uh hmm) cómo llora mi canción
Preciso tu atención, debes oir

Hoy no sé quién soy ni sé adónde voy
Encontrarme hoy es mi misión
De tu prisión por fin ya soy libre

Oye
Esto no tiene salida
Ya nada sirve que digas
Tengo que escapar
Yo tengo que escuchar a mi corazón
Hoy
Buscaré mi propia luz
No seas insensible
Soy más de lo que fui por ti
Llena de valor voy a partir
Yo tengo que encontrar mi voz

Nunca quisiste que me fuera a volar
Callar mi identidad, que gran error

Hoy grito no tengo más temor
Hoy tu alumna te dice adiós
De tu prisión por fin ya soy libre

Oye
Esto no tiene salida
Ya nada sirve que digas
Tengo que escapar
Yo tengo que escuchar a mi corazón
Hoy
Buscaré mi propia luz
No seas insensible
Soy más de lo que fui por ti
Llena de valor, voy a partir
Yo tengo que encontrar mi voz

Yo soy tu gran creación
Por eso es que me voy
Dime adiós, dime adiós
Oye
Lo que tengo que decir
No puedo ya seguir viviendo así
Ya me voy
Buscaré mi propia luz
No seas insensible
Soy más de lo que fui por ti
Llena de valor, hoy me iré sin ti
Yo tengo que encontrar mi voz
¡Mi voz!Embed
Yeah, yall ready for this one?
Uh-huh, yeah
Cause I just want you to dance
Beyonce, Tony Starks
Yeah, the remix
Music World, yeah
Beat beats, cmon
(All the ladies if you feel me, help me sing it out)
Yo, baby, whats all this you telling everybody
We broke up and all this, you know what Im saying?
Im hearin off the streets and all that, ma
Talk to me or something, huh
I dont know whats goin on, baby
You know, I got my clothes up in the joint
And you up here just packin my gear
What happened, boo?

I cant believe I believed everything we had would last
So young and naive of me to think she was from your past
Silly of me to dream of one day having your kids
Love is so blind, it feels right when its wrong
I cant believe I fell for your schemes, Im smarter than that
So young and naive to believe that with me, youre a changed man
Foolish of me to compete, when you cheat with loose women
It took me some time but now I moved on, cause I realized I got

Me, myself and I, thats all I got in the end
Thats what I found out
And it aint no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
Imon gonna be my own best friend
Me, myself and I, thats all I got in the end
Thats what I found out
And it aint no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
Imon gonna be my own best friend

(Youre so) controlling, you say that you love me, but you dont
Your family told me one day, I would see it on my own
Next thing I know Im dealing with your three kids in my home
Love is so blind, it feels right when its wrong
Now that its over, stop calling me, come pick up your clothes
Aint no need to front like youre still with me, all your homies know
Even your very best friend tried to warn me on the low
It took me some time, but now I am strong
Because I realized I got

Me, myself and I, thats all I got in the end
Thats what I found out
And it aint no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
Imon gonna be my own best friend
Me, myself and I, thats all I got in the end
Thats what I found out
And it aint no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
Imon gonna be my own best friend
(Ive got me, myself and I)
I know that I will never disappoint myself
(I must have cried a thousand times)
All the ladies if you feel me help me sing it out
(I cant regret all the time spent with you)
Yeah, you hurt me, but I learned a lot along the way
(Its how I learned how to make it through)
After all the rain, youll see the sun come out again
(Ive got me, myself and I)
Yeah, I know that I will never disappoint myself
(I must have cried a thousand times)
Ive cried, all the ladies if you feel me help me sing it out
(I cant regret all the time spent with you)
Yeah, you hurt me, but I learned a lot along the way
(Its how I learned how to make it through)
After all the rain, youll see the sun come out again

Changes, we all go through changes
Arguments, disagreements, and to some its dangerous
But your mind and your hearts clogged with all your pain and
But a bond that we was holdings what made us famous
Hey miss, beautiful mami with tears of stone
Stop cryin, come talk to Tone
Tell me everything thats goin wrong like your needs and doubts
My reason for coming in late, I need cheese and sprouts
So I could continue to hold down the foundation
Its pitiful how you could charge me with violations
Patience is the key, fuck the frustrations
We act off our emotions and we start hatin
And that leads to stress, problems and weight loss
Total baldness, broke homes come from negative forces
Baby be cautious, you got to call the cops to get me out
When it come, babe, Im goin all out
Its T-O-N-E-Y, to Beyonce, my, sweetie pie
Please try, be mine til we die
Now Ive got me, myself and I
(Me, myself and I)
I must have cried a thousand times
(I have cried so many times)
I cant regret time spent with you
(I cant regret time spent with you)
Its how I learned how to make it through
(After all the rain, youll see the sun come out again)
Now Ive got me, myself and I
(I know that I will never disappoint myself)
I must have cried a thousand times
(If youve cried a thousand times, ladies you will survive)
I cant regret time spent with you
(Yeah, you hurt me but I learned a lot along the way)
Its how I learned how to make it through

As a Black woman, I used to feel like the world wanted me to stay in my little box. And Black women often feel underestimated. And I wanted us to be proud of not only the show, but the process. Be proud of the struggle. Thankful for the beauty that comes with a painful history and rejoice in the pain. Rejoice in the imperfections and the wrongs that are so damn right. And I wanted everyone to be grateful for their curves, their sass, their honesty. Thankful for their freedomEmbed

If this what you truly want, I can wear her skin...over mine.
Her hair, over mine.
Her hands as gloves.
Her teeth as confetti.
Her scalp, a cap. Her sternum, my bedazzled cane.
We can pose for a photograph. All three of us, immortalized. You and your perfect girl.
I dont know when love became elusive. What I know is no one I know has it.
My fathers arms around my mothers neck. Fruit too ripe to eat.
I think of lovers as trees... growing to and from one another.
Searching for the same light.
Why cant you see me? Why cant you see me? (Why cant you) Why cant you see me? Everyone else can.Embed

If I were a boy
Even just for a day
Id roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
Id kick it with who I wanted
And Id never get confronted for it
Cause theyd stick up for me

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear Id be a better man
Id listen to her
Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
Cause hes taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

If you wеre a boy
Then, girl, youd understand
You need to stop listеnin to your friends
Love, respect, and trust your man
So I go to clubs with the guys
And sometimes flirt with the girls
I should be able to roll out
As long as Im comin home to you
And give you the world

But youre not a boy
So you dont have a clue, babe
How I work and pay the bills
How everything I do is for you
Hey, hey

Id listen to her
Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
Cause hes taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

If I were a boy (If I were a girl)
I would turn off my phone (I wouldnt play games)
Tell everyone its broken
So theyd think that I was sleeping alone
(Girl, you know thats wrong)
Id put myself first
And make the rules as I go
Cause I know that shed be faithful
Waiting for me to come home, to come home

But youre not a boy
So you cant understand
You are not a perfect woman
And I am not a perfect man
Id listen to her
Cause I know how it hurts (And I know how you feel)
When you lose the one you wanted
Cause hes taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed (Said Im sorry)

Its a little too late for you to come back
But I cant let you go, cause Im too attached
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

But youre just a boyEmbed
Say my name, say my name
You actin kinda shady, aint callin me baby
Better say my name

Any other day, I would call, you would say (Say)
Baby, hows your day?
But today, it aint the same
Every other word is uh-huh, ok (Uh-huh, ok)
Could it be that you at the crib with another lady?
If you took it there, first of all, let me say
I am not the one to sit around, and be played
Baby why, why you gots to lie?
Im all up in your game, boy, you better say my name, boy

(I know you say that I am assuming things)
Somethings going down thats the way it seems
(Shouldnt be no reason why youre acting strange)
If nobodys holding you back from me
(Cause I know how you usually do)
When you say everything to me times two
(Why cant you just tell the truth?)
If somebodys there then tell me who, oh

Say my name, say my name (Say my name)
If no one is around you, say baby, I love you
If you aint runnin game
Say my name, say my name (Say my name)

Slow down, they dont love you like I love you
Back up, they dont love you like I love you
Step down, they dont love you like I love you
Cant you see theres no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they dont love you like I love you
Slow down

Hey, this such a shame
You let this good love go to waste
I always keep the top tier, 5 star
Backseat lovin in the car

Humanity requires both men and women, and we are equally important and need one another. So why are we viewed as less than equal? These old attitudes are drilled into us from the very beginning. We have to teach our boys the rules of equality and respect, so that as they grow up, gender equality becomes a natural way of life. And we have to teach our girls that they can reach as high as humanly possible
We have a lot of work to do, but we can get there if we work together. Women are more than 50 percent of the population and more than 50 percent of voters. We must demand that we all receive 100 percent of the opportunities23Embed
The cards never lie, my last breath a sigh
And now I think about if its my time to die
I dont know what I was thinking, steady wasting time with Hill
And I need to live my life because my time is unforgiven
I cant understand how my life changed around
Manifest my destiny, is it the brown underground?
Blue skies are turning gray its the point of indecision
Believing in the cards you must respect its every vision

Girlfriend, get your mind on line
Dont spend your time cause you cant waste your time
Everyday like its your last, but you must feel divine
Intervention comes and snatch up all your dreams from behind
Love!
You feel it and you got to let them know it
Love!
Your heart and thats the feeling that you go with
If you have a dream you need to go and let them know it
Cause you could wake up in the morning and it could be over

No, No, No, No
I dont wanna, I dont wanna
I dont wanna go
Just, Just, Just let me stay home
Let me live my dream, let me see another dawn
No, No, No, No
I dont wanna, I dont wanna
I dont wanna go
Just, Just, Just let me stay home
Let me live my dream, let me see another dawn

Carmen, dont listen cause the cards have deceit
Just slide him the money, we dont need a receipt
Truth only exists within the eyes of the beholder
Plus hes kind of young for fortune telling
He probably should be older

But the cards never lie, I thought I told you
Now its her turn to try, to reach her goals before she reaches the sky

This is love
Its like Im trying to throw my life away
Sometimes love is all you got and other times it makes you pay

Well when you finally rise
Then youll realize
The windows to the soul are not the hips but the eyes

Oh You could wish on the stars but theyre dead, just a lie

But they shine just as bright as they did their entire life
No, No, No, No
I dont wanna, I dont wanna
I dont wanna go
Just, Just, Just let me stay home
Let me live my dreams, let me see another dawn
No, No, No, No
I dont wanna, I dont wanna
I dont wanna go
Just, Just, Just let me stay home
Just let me live my dreams, let me see another dawnEmbed
Even just for a day
I’d roll outta bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted and go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I’d kick it with who I wanted
And I’d never get confronted for it
Cause they’d stick up for me
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I’d be a better man
I’d listen to her
Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
Cause he’s taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed
If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it’s broken
So they’d think that I was sleepin’ alone
I’d put myself first
And make the rules as I go
Cause I know that she’d be faithful
Waitin’ for me to come home
To come home
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I’d be a better man
I’d listen to her
Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
Cause he’s taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed
Its a little too late for you to come back
Say its just a mistake
Think Id forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong
But you’re just a boy
You don’t understand
Yeah, you don’t understand
How it feels to love a girl, someday
You wish you were a better man
You don’t listen to her
You don’t care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
Cause you’ve taken her for granted
And everything you have got destroyed
But you’re just a boy
I want you to know that Im happy for you
I wish nothing but the best for you both
An older version of me
Is she perverted like me
Would she go down on you in a theatre
Does she speak eloquently
And would she have your baby
Im sure shed make a really excellent mother
Cause the love that you gave that we made
Wasnt able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name
Does she know how you told me youd hold me
Until you died, til you died
But youre still alive

And Im here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
Its not fair to deny me of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know
You seem very well, things look peaceful
Im not quite as well, I thought you should know
Did you forget about me Mr. Duplicity
I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner
It was a slap in the face how quickly I was replaced
Are you thinking of me when you fuck her
Cause the love that you gave that we made
Wasnt able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name
Does she know how you told me youd hold me
Until you died, til you died
But youre still alive
And Im here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
Its not fair to deny me of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know
But you’re just a boy
Yeah, you don’t understand
Until you lose the one you wanted
Cause you’ve taken her for granted
And everything you have got destroyed
But you’re just a boyEmbed

All in all youve been there for me
You showed me things I would never see
I think Im ready
By my side youve been waitin
Respectfully and oh so patient
I think Im ready
I feel it in my chest as I dance with you
Got so much control you havent made a move
You give me reassurance in the things you do
And thats why
I think Im ready

Baby, Im not afraid
To go the way but its my first time
And baby, I know you wanna change the speed
And Ima let you take the lead but its my first time
And baby, Im not afraid
To go the way but its my first time
And baby I know you wanna change the speed
And Ima let you take the lead remember its my first time

Arm in arm, eye to eye
As the music plays emotions rise
I think Im ready
In your eyes I see three words
Hold me tight cause Im about to burst
I think Im ready
I feel it in my chest as I dance with you
Got so much control you havent made a move
You give me reassurance in the things you do
And thats why
I think Im ready

(Its my first time
Remember your first time
Its my first time)

I feel like Im losing my mind

Love doesnt feel like this
This is my final wish

The next time your truck rolls by
No matter how hard I cry
Please dont stop in front of me
Cause your loves no longer sweet
The next time I bring you change
Baby, please pull back your hand
You know youre not what I need
Let me go, let me do Bey

Chasing after you like an ice cream truck
I try my luck and catch up but
Its always out of love

Im chasing you again, finally
You stopped and I jumped on
I realized the flavor was wrong
You thought I was still holdin on
You looked and I was gone

The next time your truck rolls by

Ill send you a postcard

Hey, baby

Took that job you said I could not get
Wore that dress you said Id never fit

Cause youre gone, and Im great
I got rid of your dead weight
And Ill wave at you behind me
With a new smile on my face, cause

Im walkin in new shoes now

When I talk to my friends so quietly

Tennis shoes, dont even need to buy a new dress
If you aint there, aint nobody else to impress
Its the way that you know what I thought I knew
Its the beat that my heart skips when Im with you
I still dont understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can
(Got me looking so crazy right now
Your loves got me looking so crazy right now) So crazy

The storm that rages inside
The way that I hid my damage pride
You gave me away
And Ive had enough
I imagine the words I say to you
Im finding strength to follow it through
Im ready to change

Im letting go, Im letting go
Were only friends, were only friends
Tonight well let the music free our soul
So let it show, so let it show
We cant pretend, we cant pretend
Well only find ourselves by losing all
Control, control, control, control
Control, control, control, control

Im opening up
Show me a sign I cant believe
These crazy emotions flow through me
Im gonna explode, oh
You take me away
And what is my ordinary life
I wont be afraid of what we might find a love I can hold

Im letting go, Im letting go
Were only friends, were only friends
Tonight well let the music free our soul
So let it show, so let it show
We cant pretend, we cant pretend
Well only find ourselves by losing all, no

Nothing ventured, nothing gained
New horizon ready to paint
With every breath, you take me away

Im letting go, Im letting go
Were only friends, were only friends
Tonight well let the music free our soul
So let it show, so let it show
We cant pretend, we cant pretend
We only find ourselves by loosing all

MASTER BLASTER (JAMMIN)

Alright ladies and gentlemen, i want yall to scream loud and proud for Ed Ed Sheeran

Everyones feeling pretty
Its hotter than July
Though the worlds full of problems
They couldnt touch us even if they tried
From the park I hear rhythms
Marleys hot on the box
Tonight there will be a party
On the corner at the end of the block

Didnt know you
Would be jamming until the break of dawn
I bet nobody ever told you that you
Would be jamming until the break of dawn
You would be jamming and jamming and jamming, jam on

They want us to join their fighting
But our answer today
Is to let all our worries
Like the breeze through our fingers slip away
Peace has come to Zimbabwe
Third Worlds right on the one
Nows the time for celebration
Because weve only just begun
Didnt know that you
Would be jammin until the break of dawn
Bet you nobody ever told you that you
Would be jammin until the break of dawn
You would be jammin and jammin and jammin, jam on
Bet you nobody ever told you that you
Would be jammin until the break of dawn
I know nobody told you that you
Would be jammin until the break of dawn
Were jammin, jammin, jammin, jam on
Blah! (SCATTING)
HIGHER GROUND

All the way from Texas i want yall to get up on your feet, give it up for Gary Clark Jr

People keep on learning
Soldiers keep on warring
World keep on turning
Because it wont be too long

Powers keep on lying
While your people keep on dying
World keep on turning
Because it wont be too long

Im so darn glad he let me try it again
Because my last time on earth I lived a whole world of sin
Im so glad that I know more than I knew then
Going to keep on trying
Until I reach my highest ground

Come on play that thing Gary
Play that thing, play that thing, play that thing

Im so darn glad he let me try it again
Because my last time on earth I lived a whole world of sin
Im so glad that I know more than I knew then
Going to keep on trying
Until I reach my highest ground

Come on, Come on, Come on, Come on
Come on, Come on, Come on, Come on

I was scrolling through videos about feminism on YouTube and I ran across this video of this incredible Nigerian author, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. Everything she said is exactly how I feel
My message behind this album is finding the beauty in imperfection. I had this image of this trophy and me accepting these awards and kind of training myself to be this champion. And at the end of the day when you go through all of these things, is it worth it? I mean, you get this trophy and youre like, I basically starved, I have neglected all of the people that I love, Ive conformed to what everybody else thinks I should be and I have this trophy. What does that mean?. The trophy represents all of the sacrafices I made as a kid. All of the time that I lost, being on the road/ in the studios as a child. And, I just wanna throw that shit up
I have a lot of awards and I have a lot of these things that Im amazing and Im - I worked my ass of, I worked harder then probably everybody I know to get those things but nothing feels like my child saying Mommy. No, nothing feels like when I look at my husband in the eyes, nothing feels like when Im respected, when I get on the stage and I see Im changing peoples lives. Those are the things that matter and, at this point in my life, thats what Im striving for. Growth, love, happiness, fun; enjoying your life, its short - thats the message1Embed

Yay! Beautiful job, Baba
You sound so pretty
I wanna do that again
Oh, you wanna do it again? Youre like mommy, huh?
I wanna do that again
Oh, okay
Cause it feels good
It feels good? Hahahahaha
Okay, you wanna do-
Go, lift every voice and sing

I feel we made something that made my daughter proud
Made my mother proud, my father proud, and all of the people
That are my brothers and sisters around the world
And thats why I live
Im so lucky and grateful that Im able to
Take all these crazy ideas and actually make it into somethin that
Heals people and that may spark vision in people
That shows them to dream big
And shows them that they are limitless
Its possible
If my country ass can do it, they can do itEmbed
It really hurts to say this yes it does
But after a while sweet love just aint enough
So many settle for less just because
Maybe Im more in love with what it was
But whats gets so confusing baby
You and me
Its been so much confusion lately
You couldnt see that you were losing me

Well Im alone now but I aint lonely
Im on my own now
But I aint the only
Honestly Im fine
Ill take this time to concentrate on me
And I got possibility to keep me company

Wont you just assume he doesnt care
To internalize it all isnt fare
So I address the problem so that hes aware
But I still feel all alone even when hes there
Maybe we can fix it baby
I know we can
If I make you miss it baby
Then maybe you will understand

That Im alone now but I aint lonely
Im on my own now
But I aint the only
Honestly Im fine
Ill take this time to concentrate on me
And I got possibility to keep me company

Well Im alone now but I aint lonely
Im on my own now
But I aint the only
Honestly Im fine
Ill take this time to concentrate on me

Theres no reason to make up

And I think youre nice
But I saw something else I like
And I think I gotta make you my next ex
Im onto the next (oh oh)

You call me too frequently
I thought it was so sweet in the beginning
But now youre too clingy for me
You dont put the seat down
You dont clean the house how I like it (trifling)
Thats risen enough
Youre times expired

Sorry, boy
But you got me bored
I gotta move around
If I aint got a ring by now
That means Im not tied down
I gotta
Switch em out, switch em out
Switch em out, switch em out
Kick em out, kick em out
Kick em out, kick em out
I know that you treat me right
But still I think I gotta make you my next ex (my next ex)

Is the ULTIMATE example of a truly strong
African American woman.
She is a caring mother, shes a loving wife,
while at the same time, she is the FIRST LADY!!!!
No matter the pressure, and stress of being
under the microscope - she is humble, loving and
sincere.
She builds and nurtures her family, while also
looking out for so many millions in so many ways
Michelle, thank you so much for every single
thing that u do for us - I am PROUD to have
my daughter grow up in a world where she has
people like you, to look upto.

You know you really, really, really, really
Want to be with me
So why dont you stop beating around the bush
And come and give it to me
Derek we can make beautiful music together
If you only stop resisting the only woman that you really want
And its not wifey

Hey! Youre real social
I dont like the way youre looking
Dont get too close
Im about to take you down to booking

Cmon and touch me D I know you want to

Look, I only need your prints
Dont really care about your frontal

I dont see me living another day
Without your tender kisses
Why dont we retire to the room
Put on some Luther, light some incents
Get to know one another just a little better
Than we do now

You trying to act like Im not a cop

You can bring the cuffs, if you would like to
If thats your style

Looks lets get it straight, you cease and disist
I got some platinum bracelets
Im about to squeeze on ya wrists

But you dont understand the way that I feel
The pain I could heal

I could lose my job for this
There is no way we could chill

So why you bring me this far
Now lets try to be real
Cause only time will reveal
If you still playing the field
Every second that you stay is like an hour we will
I got a couple days to kill
Either you down or you peel
I dont want anything without you in my life
You are my baby
Why dont you forget about your girl
And say you want me as your lady
Get to know one another just a little better
Than we do now
Give in to everything youre feeling thats surprising
Lets make love now

Nah, I dont think so
Your body is like weed smoke though
Light-headed, feel ya eyes saying please dont go

It aint about getting locked
Cause its your steeze I need
My heart dont lie, come over D and feel my beat

Oh no! Cause I can see your skin is soft
You know, but I dont wanna pay the cost to be with you

You cant deny your feelings for us
You know its true
I gotta go, but really now Im feeling you
I wanna do it, but I dont
You know, Id feel your thigh, but Im so full of decency

Go with your instincts and Im sure it leads to me
Theres only moments to see if it is to be...Embed
I like to feel so high and you feel good feeling low
I like my colors vivid and you paint your colors gold
I like to see the world and you like your weekends home
But Ive been staying behind
While you refused to go

Cause youre such a burden
But youre the weight up off my shoulders
Cause even though Im hurting
It still feels like its time Im growing
When I thought that wed grow up and grow
Together the same time
Guess I passed you by at that old Stop sign
At that old Stop sign

You like to sleep all day and I like my minutes
I like trips to the movies you watch TV all night long
I like to go out dancing and you go out just to hang
And Ive been right beside you losing me and doing the same

Cause youre such a burden
But youre the weight up off my shoulders
Cause even though Im hurting
It still feels like its time Im growing
When I thought that wed grow up and grow
Together the same time
Guess I passed you by at that old Stop sign
At that old Stop sign

I looked around and baby you were gone
Where did I lose you honey
I even slowed down thought youd follow
But you took your own roads honey
Cause Ive been traveling traveling traveling
Only to find that
Im making this trip alone
And Ive been staying behind
While you refused to go

Cause youre such a burden
But youre the weight up off my shoulders
Cause even though Im hurting
It still feels like its time Im growing
When I thought that wed grow up and grow
Together the same time
Guess I passed you by at that old Stop sign
At that old Stop signEmbed

Ive been watching for the signs
Took a trip to clear my mind
Now Im even more lost
And youre still so fine, oh my oh my
Been having conversations about breakups and separations
Im not feeling like myself since the baby
Are we gonna even make it? Oooh
Cause if we are, were taking this a little too far
Me being wherever Im at, worried about wherever you are
Were taking this a little too far

Know you wanna roll with a good girl?
Do it big do it all for a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Dont sleep when you know you got it good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Wanna roll, wanna roll with a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
And I still keep it hood, still treat you like I should
Wassup
On my mind up past my bedtime, no rest at the kingdom
Alone in my place, my heart is away
All that I can think of is, we should get married
We should get married
Lets stop holding back on this and lets get carried away
Stop making a big deal out of the little things
Cause I got big deals and I got little things
Got everything Im asking for but you
Stop making a big deal out of the little things, lets get carried away
Come right now, you know where I stay
I just wanna say, youre mine, youre mine
I just wanna say, youre mine, youre mine
Fuck what you heard, youre mine, youre mine

Youre all alone
I did this
I got no one else to blame
You didnt know
I was a risk
And its such a crying shame
How you gave me all of you and wanted nothing else from me
But to make some time for you but all I made you was lonely

I couldnt see
But now I know
That I acted selfishly
I shouldve known
That I let you down
Caused you so much misery
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed

I shouldve been there
I shouldve been there
I shouldve been there
I shouldve been there
I shouldve been there

All of the times
You used to cry
Because I would let you down
Im losing time
I shouldve tried
A little more to be around
But I didnt know that you were hurting, I was just too blind
Only thing I know for certain: another you Ill never find

I couldnt see
But now I know
That I acted selfishly
I shouldve known
That I let you down
Caused you so much misery
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed

I shouldve been there
I shouldve been there
I shouldve been there
I shouldve been there
I shouldve been there
Im filled with regret
Im gonna tip and sew myself in misery
Now in your life
Ill take more time
No more yearning without me
But it hurts to think of you all by yourself but now I see
And I apologize for all the times I left you home waiting for me

I couldnt see
But now I know
That I acted selfishly
I shouldve known
That I let you down
Caused you so much misery
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed

I shouldve been there
I shouldve been there
I shouldve been there
I shouldve been there
I shouldve been there
Im gonna be there (Im gonna be there)

Boy I know you want me
I can see it in your eyes
But you keep on frontin
Why dont you say whats on your mind
Cause each and everytime
Youre near me
You give me signs
But when I ask you Whats the deal?
Youre holdin it all inside
If you wanna be with me
You gotta keep it real
Tell me whats goin on
Tell me how you feel
Boy I know you want me
Just as much as I want you
So come get my love
All here for you
Everytime I see you with your boys
You pretend as if you dont want me
When you get home you call me on the phone
And tell me how much you care
Bug a boo(talk)
You buggin what?
You buggin Who?
You buggin me
You make me wanna throw my pager out the window
Tell MCI to cut the phone poles
Break my lease so I can move
Cause you a bug-a boo, a bug-a boo
I wanna put your number on the call block
Have AOL make my e-mail stop
Can you pay my bills
Can you pay my telephone bills
Can you pay my automo-bills
If you did then maybe we could chill
I dont think you do
So, you and me are through
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you

Better say my name!
Any other day I would call
You would say, baby hows your day?
But today it aint the same
Every other word is
Uh huh, yeah okay
Could it be that you
Are at the crib with another lady?
If you took it there first of all
Let me say, I am not the one
To sit around and be played
Why do you feel you gotta lie?
Gettin caught up in yourone game
When you can not say my name
I know you say that I am assuming things
Somethings going down thats the way it seems
Shouldnt be a reason why youre acting strange
If nobodys holding you back from me
Cause I know how you usually do
When you say everything to me times two
Why cant you just tell the truth?
If somebodys there then tell me who
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say baby I love you
If you aint runnin game
Say my name, say my name
You actin kinda shady
Aint callin me baby

You ready B? Lets go get em
Look for me, Young, B, cruising down the Westside highway
Doing what we like to do, our, way
Eyes behind shades, this necklace the reason
All of my dates been blind dates
But today, I got my thoroughest girl wit me
Im mashing the gas, shes grabbing the wheel
Its true to the heart, she rides with me
The new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we dont speak is during Sex and the City
She gets Carrie fever but soon as the show is over
Shes right back to being my soldier
Cause mamis a rider and Im a roller
Put us together, how they gon stop both us?
What ever she lacks, Im right over her shoulder
When Im off track mami is keeping me focused
So lets, lock this down like its supposed to be
The 03 Bonnie & Clyde, Hov and B
All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride til the very end, its me and my boyfriend
All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride til the very end, its me and my boyfriend
The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you loving
With the same respect that you treat the one that you humping
Now they bout nothing if ever you mad about something
It wont be that, oh no it wont be that
I dont be at, places where we comfy at
With no be-atch, oh no, you wont see that
And no, I aint perfect, nobody walking this earths surface is
But girlfriend, work with the kid
I keep you working at Kermain, Birkin Bag
Manolo Blahnik Timbs, aviator lens
600 drops, Mercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I dont have to worry, only worry is him
She do anything necessary for him
And I do anything necessary for her
So dont let the necessary occur, yep
All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride til the very end, its me and my boyfriend
All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride til the very end, its me and my boyfriend
(Talk to em B)
If I was your girlfriend
Ill be there for you, if somebody hurts you
Even if its somebody takes my place
Yeah-hee
(Break it down for em)
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us
And I promise Ill give my life
And all of my trust if you was my boyfriend
Put this on my life
The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in
I promise Ill give my life
And all of my trust if you was my boyfriend
All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride til the very end, its me and my boyfriend
All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride til the very end, its me and my boyfriendEmbed

I tried to make a home out of you
But doors lead to trap doors
A stairway leads to nothing
Unknown women wander the hallways at night
Where do you go when you go quiet?
You remind me of my father, a magician, able to exist in two places at once
In the tradition of men in my blood you come home at 3 a.m. and lie to me
What are you hiding?
The past and the future merge to meet us here
What luck, what a fucking curse.Embed
Cliché, cliché, cliché, cliché
Who wants that hero love that saves the day, anyway
Cliché, cliché, cliché, cliché
What about the bad guy goes good, yeah
An innocent love un-misunderstood, yeah
Black hour glass, hour glass
Toast to cliché is in a dark past
Toast to cliché is in a dark past
I dont care if we on the run
Baby, long as Im next to you
And if loving you is a crime
Tell me why do I bring out
The best in you
I hear sirens while we make love
Loud as hell but they dont know
Theyre nowhere near us
I will hold your heart and your gun
I dont care if they come, no
I know its crazy but
They can take me
Now that I found the places that you take me
Without you I got nothing to lose
Who wants that perfect love story any way, anyway
Cliché, cliché, cliché, cliché
Who wants that hero love that saves the day, anyway
Cliché, cliché, cliché, cliché
What about the bad guy goes good, yeah
An innocent love un-misunderstood, yeah
Black hour glass, hour glass
Toast to cliché is in a dark past
Toast to cliché is in a dark past
I dont care if they give me life
I get all of my life from you
And if loving you had a price
I would pay my life for you
I hear sirens while we make love
Loud as hell but they dont know
Theyre nowhere near us
I will hold your heart and your gun
I dont care if they come, no
I know its crazy but
They can take me
Now that I found the places that you take me
Without you I got nothing to lose
I dont care Ill never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all away
No I swear Ill never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all away
I dont care Ill never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all away
No I swear Ill never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all away
Without you I got nothing to loseEmbed

Boys, Im back! Are you happy?

To the song here in my heart
A melody I start
But cant complete
Hmm
Im screaming out
And my dreams will be heard
They will not be pushed aside and turned
Into your own
All cause you wont
Listen
Listen
I am alone at a crossroads
Im not at home in my own home
And I tried and tried
To say whats on my mind
You should have known
Oh
Now Im done believin you
You dont know what Im feeling
Im more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now Ive gotta find my own
I dont know where I belong
But Ill be moving on
If you dont, if you wont
Listen
To the song here in my heart
A melody I start but I will complete
Woah
Now Im done believing you
You dont know what Im feeling
Im more than what you made of me
I followed the voice that you gave to me
But now Ive gotta find my own
My own

Oh, killing me softly and Im still falling
Still the one I need, I will always be with you
Oh, you got me all gone, dont ever let me go
Say it real loud if you fly
If you leave me youre out of your mind

My baby is a ten
We dressing to the nine
He pick me up, we eight
Make me feel so lucky, seven
He kiss me in his six
We be making love in five
Still the one I do this four
Im trying to make us three
From that two
He still the one

Theres ups and downs in this love
Got a lot to learn in this love
Through the good and the bad, still got love
Dedicated to the one I love, hey
Still love the way he talk, still love the way I sing
Still love the way he rock them black diamonds in that chain
Still all up on each other, aint a damn thing change
My girls cant tell me nothing, Im gone in the brain
Im all up under him like its cold, winter time
All up in the kitchen in my heels, dinner time
Do whatever that it takes, he got a winners mind
Give it all to him, meet him at the finish line

Me and my boo in my boos coupe riding
All up in that black with his chick right beside him
Ladies, if you love your man, show him you the fliest
Grind up on it, girl, show him how you ride it
Me and my boo in my boos coupe riding
All up in that black with his chick right beside him
Ladies, if you love your man, show him you the fliest

Or my football playa friend whose been beggin me to end it
My attorney on Brickle wit a big popsicle
Who aint neva had a hard time aimin at tha middle

Babe
Gotta know one thing before you ask my name
Be straight up and tell me whats your aim
A girl like me, see I dont play no games, no no
Thats why I say
If you wanna be with me, go all the way
Do what you gotta do, just let me state
Is it real or is this just a fake? (tell me)

Been near the hood lately?
Where you from and where you be?
Whats good with you, baby?

Babe
Youre sittin over there, tryna figure out what to say
Make up your mind right now, dont contemplate
You know that I dont have time to waste, no no
Where do we go?
What this thing could be, well never know
There is just no way that we can flow
If you aint being honest from the go (tell me)

Whats good with you, baby?
Wanna get to know me?
Whats really good, baby?
Do you have a lady?
Been near the hood lately?
Where you from and where you be?
Whats good with you, baby?

Dont try playing with my mind
Boy, I dont have no time
For something that I know aint good for me
Dont hesitate to say
You feel the chemistry
I wanna know, should I take a chance with you?

Whats good with you, baby?
Wanna get to know me?

If I were a boy
Even just for a day
Id roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
Id kick it with who I wanted
And Id never get confronted for it
Cause theyd stick up for me

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear Id be a better man
Id listen to her
Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
Cause hes taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone its broken
So theyd think that I was sleepin alone
Id put myself first
And make the rules as I go
Cause Id know that shed be faithful
Waitin for me to come home
To come home

If I were a boy
I think I could understand, oh
How it feels to love a girl
I swear Id be a better man
Id listen to her
Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted (Wanted)
Cause hes taken you for granted (Granted)
And everything you had got destroyed
Its a little too late for you to come back
Say, its just a mistake
Think Id forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

Tell me how you tolerate the things that you just found out about

You never know
Why are we the ones who suffer?
I have to let go

For a beautiful liar
Cant we laugh about it? (Ha Ha Ha)
(Oh) Its not worth our time
(Oh) We can live without them
Just a beautiful liar

I trusted him, but when I followed you, I saw you together
I didnt know about you then till I saw you with him again
I walked in on your love scene, slow dancing
You stole everything, how can you say I did you wrong

Well never know
When the pain and heartbreaks over
I have to let go
The innocence is gone

(Ay) Lets not kill the karma
(Ay) Lets not start a fight
(Ay) Its not worth the drama

What a lovely way to burn

You give me fever
Catch the fever

Even just for a day
Id roll outta bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted and go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I’d kick it with who I wanted
And Id never get confronted for it
Cause theyd stick up for me
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I’d be a better man
Id listen to her
Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
Cause hes taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed
If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone its broken
So theyd think that I was sleepin alone
Id put myself first
And make the rules as I go
Cause I know that shed be faithful
Waitin’ for me to come home
To come home
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I’d be a better man
Id listen to her
Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
Cause he’s taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed
Its a little too late for you to come back
Say its just a mistake
Think Id forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong
But you’re just a boy
You dont understand
Yeah, you dont understand
How it feels to love a girl, someday
You wish you were a better man
You dont listen to her
You dont care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
Cause youve taken her for granted
And everything you have got destroyed
But youre just a boy
I want you to know that Im happy for you
I wish nothing but the best for you both
An older version of me
Is she perverted like me
Would she go down on you in a theatre
Does she speak eloquently
And would she have your baby
Im sure shed make a really excellent mother
Cause the love that you gave that we made
Wasnt able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name
Does she know how you told me youd hold me
Until you died, til you died
But youre still alive

And Im here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
Its not fair to deny me of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know
You seem very well, things look peaceful
Im not quite as well, I thought you should know
Did you forget about me Mr. Duplicity
I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner
It was a slap in the face how quickly I was replaced
Are you thinking of me when you fuck her
Cause the love that you gave that we made
Wasnt able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name
Does she know how you told me youd hold me
Until you died, til you died
But youre still alive
And Im here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
Its not fair to deny me of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know
But youre just a boy
Yeah, you dont understand
Until you lose the one you wanted
Cause youve taken her for granted
And everything you have got destroyed
But youre just a boy2Embed

Decked out, chestout

You should see the eyes on me, dress fittin like a prize on me

Hard to let go, Harder to hold
Ill dance wit ya slowly, too a hip-hop joint
And only stop on a positive, you got the point?

I dont dance, i dont drink i dont like clubs im not impressed

To me yall are all basic
And ya life is wasted
Thats why u a cop

You wouldnt go back
Ill prove it to you
Come out wit me tonight, thatll do it for you!Embed
Remember those walls I built?

Burnin through my darkest night

Think Im addicted to your light
I swore Id never fall again
But this dont even feel like fallin
Gravity cant begin
To pull me back to the ground again

Its like Ive been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin
The risk that Im takin

The scent of lust and fame
Perfume and cheap cocaine
Bombarded by marauders and their sons
But mostly daughters with no shame
Youre so quick to lose their names
Cause theyre all the same
Tune them out to pray again
Release your guilt and shame
Youre fooled by another mirage
Youre fooled by another menage
A fool is just a fool, just play it cool
Just keep collecting your applause
A devil with no cause
It all comes back, we all go limp
Wе all cant win, we sin the same old sins

Hе never gonna drink again
He never gonna smoke again
He never fucking up again
He sin the same old sins
Im never gonna love again
Never gonna trust again
Im never love a thug again
Ill never gonna love again
Never gonna love again
Never gonna love again

You drag me in the rain
We swerving off the lane
He finished when he started
When he lost and he was king and she escaped
We all cant run the game
It all comes back, we all go limp
We all cant win, we sin the same old sins

He never gonna drink again
He never gonna smoke again
He never fucking up again
But you sin the same old sins
Im never gonna love again
Im never gonna trust again
Im never leaning in again
Ill never gonna love again
Never gonna love again

So I see, the same old
So I see, the same old
So I see, the same old
So I see, the same old
Hes never gonna drink again

Never fucking up again
We sin the same old sins

I feel like, right now, people experience music differently. I remember seeing Thriller on TV with my family. It was an event; we all sat around the TV and now, looking back, Im so lucky I was born around that time. I miss that...immersive experience. Now, people only listen to a few seconds of a song on their iPods - they dont really invest in a full album. Its all about the single and the hype, theres so much that gets between the music and the artist and the fans. I felt like I dont want anybody to give the message when my record is comnig out. I just want this to come out when its ready and from me to my fans. I told my team I wanna shoot a video for every song and put them all out at the same time, everyone thought I was crazy but were actually doing it. Its happening

I wanted to make this body of work and, I feel like its something thats lost in Pop music. I wanted people to hear things differently and have a different first impression. Not just listen to a ten second clip but see the whole vision of the album. It was important that we made this a movie, we made this an experience. I wanted everyone to see the whole picture and to see how personal everything is to me. I would make my best art and just put it out and thats-thats why its out todayEmbed

Lets go get em

Baby, seem like everywhere I go I see you
From your eyes I smile, its like I breathe you
Helplessly I reminisce, dont want to
Compare nobody to you

Boy, I try to catch myself, but Im outta control
Your sexiness is so appealing, I cant let it go

Know that I cant get over you
Cause everything I see is you
And I dont want no substitute
Baby, I swear its Déjà Vu
Know that I cant get over you
Cause everything I see is you
And I dont want no substitute
Baby, I swear its Déjà Vu

Seeing, things that I know cant be, am I dreaming?
When I saw you walkin past me, almost called your name
Got a better glimpse and then I looked away
Feels like Im losing it

Boy, I try to catch myself, but Im outta control
Your sexiness is so appealing, I cant let it go

Know that I cant get over you
Cause everything I see is you
And I dont want no substitute
Baby, I swear its Déjà Vu
Know that I cant get over you
Cause everything I see is you
And I dont want no substitute
Baby, I swear its Déjà Vu

Yes

Baby, I cant go anywhere
Without thinking that youre there
Seems like youre everywhere, its true
Gotta be having Deja Vu
Cause in my mind I want you here
Get on the next plane, I dont care
Is it because Im missin you
That Im having Déjà Vu?
Boy, I try to catch myself, but Im outta control
Your sexiness is so appealing, I cant let it go

Know that I cant get over you
Cause everything I see is you
And I dont want no substitute
Baby, I swear its Déjà Vu
Know that I cant get over you
Cause everything I see is you

I used to run base like Juan Pierre
Now I run the bass hi-hat and the snare
I used to bag girls like Birkin Bags
Now I bag B. (Boy, you hurtin that)
Brooklyn Bay where they birthed me at
Now be everywhere, the nerve of rap
The audacity to have me with them curtains back
Me and B., she about to sting, stand back

Baby, seem like everywhere I go, I see you
From your eyes I smile, its like I breathe you
Helplessly I reminisce, dont want to
Compare nobody to you

Know that I cant get over you

Yes, Hovas flow so unusual
Baby girl you should already know
Its H-O, light up the dro
Cause you gonna need help tryna study my, bounce
Flow, blow, whats the difference?
One you take in vein while the other you sniffin
Its still dope, po-po try to convict him
Thats a no-go my dough keep the scales tippin
Like 4-4s, like Im from the H-
O-U-S-T-O-N
Blow wind, so Chicago of him
Is he the best ever? Thats the argu-a-ment
I dont make the list, dont be mad at me
I just make the hits like a factory
Im just one of one, nothin after me
No Déjà Vu, just me and my- (OH!)
Seeing, things that I know cant be, am I dreaming?
When I saw you walkin past me almost called your name
Got a better glimpse and then I looked away
Feels like Im losing it

Know that I cant get over you
Cause everything I see is you
And I dont want no substitute
Baby, I swear its Déjà Vu
Know that I cant get over you
Cause everything I see is you

Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start, but cant complete
Listen to the sound from deep within
It’s only beginning to find release

Oh the time has come for my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside and turned
Into your own, all cause you wont listen

Listen, I am alone at a crossroads
I’m not at home in my own home
And Ive tried and tried
To say whats on my mind
You should have known, oh
Now Im done believin you
You dont know what Im feelin
I’m more than what
You’ve made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now Ive gotta find my own
You should have listened

There was someone here inside
Someone I thought had died
So long ago

Oh, I’m screamin out
And my dreams will be heard
They will not be pushed aside or turned
Into your own
All cause you wont listen

Listen. I am alone at a crossroads
I’m not at home in my own home
And Ive tried and tried
To say whats on my mind
You should have known, oh
Now Im done believin you
You dont know what Im feelin
Im more than what
Youve made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now Ive gotta find my own

I dont know where I belong
But Ill be moving on
If you dont, if you wont

Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start, but I will complete
Now Im done believin you
You dont know what Im feelin
Im more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you think you gave to me
But now Ive gotta find my own, my ownEmbed
Im wishing on a dream to follow what it means
Check it out, you can catch me on top now, playin a club
Throwin a shot down, tryin to stay above
Ground, another ground-breakin day in the club
Surrounded by my home thoughts, playin a cut
Reminesin on days I didnt have a pot to piss in
No watches to glisin, no Vs with hot systems
Missin my homies that passed right in front of my eyes
Due to the fast life we told wonderful lies
On how we would live forever, time proved us wrong
Had to get our shit together and move it along
Had dreams of being Big niggas, Jig niggas
Drivin the hottest cars, movin out with our moms and Im
Wishing on a star to follow where you are
Im wishing on a dream to follow what it means
Was interuppted by this chicken that I used to cluck wit
Back in the days when I was movin much shit, What up chick?
Maintanin, its the same old thang
A little stress, a little bullshit, aint too much changed
I see you kept it movin, you see I kept improving, she nodded her head in agreement
Remember when I used to walk up and down the cement, puttin it down
While the Streets is Watchin, stay hooded down
Just to earn a rep, but what good is it now?
She said Damn I just stopped to say Hi.... Bye
I was too deep for you from day one
Thats why we never had relations, continued in my own zone
Im wishing on a star to follow where you are
Im wishing on a dream to follow what it means
And I wish on all the rainbows that I see
I wish on all the people who really dream
And Im wishing on tomorrow praying it will come
And Im wishing on all the loving weve ever done
Uh huh, We used to play tap-tap for rap tracks
Run, catch, and kiss in the back park until it got dark
Wanted to be like the older fellas, sneak and drink old Chample
Dangerous games we played on the third rail
Fiend for the summer breeze
Hopped out the Lees Dungrares
Into the Hawaiian shorts, relying on sports
To take us away from here, but I cut too much
So I had a plan B used to rhyme with a brush
My sinners used to back me up
Like Doug E. Fresh and Ricky D., Eric, Mickey and Me
All my niggas is you with me, each of yall
Lets reach for the stars now... Jigga!
Im wishing on a star to follow where you are
Im wishing on a dream to follow what it means
And I wish on all the rainbows that I see
I wish on all the people who really dream
And Im wishing on tomorrow praying it will come
And Im wishing on all the loving weve ever doneEmbed

All the ladies, if you feel me
Help me sing it out

I cant believe I believed
Everything we had would last
So young and naive for me
To think she was from your past
Silly of me to dream
Of one day having your kids
Love is so blind
It feels right when its wrong

I cant believe I fell for your schemes
Im smarter than that
So dumb and naive to believe
That with me youre a changed man
Foolish of me to compete
When you cheat with loose women
It took me some time
But now I moved on
Because I realized I got

Me, myself, and I
Thats all I got in the end
Thats what I found out
And it aint no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
Im gonna be my own best friend
Me, myself, and I
Thats all I got in the end
Thats what I found out
And it aint no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
Im gonna be my own best friend

So controlling, you said
That you love me but you dont
Your family told me
One day I would see it on my own
Next thing I know, Im dealing
With your three kids in my home
Love is so blind
It feels right when its wrong

Now that its over
Stop calling me
Come pick up your clothes
Aint no need to front
Like youre still with me
All your homies know
Even your very best friend
Tried to warn me on the low
It took me some time
But now I am strong
Because I realized I got

Me, myself, and I
Thats all I got in the end
Thats what I found out
And it aint no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
Im gonna be my own best friend
Me, myself, and I
Thats all I got in the end
Thats what I found out
And it aint no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
Im gonna be my own best friend
(Got me, myself, and I)
I know that I will never disappoint myself
(I must have cried a thousand times)
All the ladies, if you feel me
Help me sing it out
(I cant regret time spent with you)
Yeah, you hurt me
But I learned a lot along the way
(So I have vowed to make it through)
After all the rain
Youll see the sun come out again

IT IS UP TO US TO TAKE A STAND AND DEMAND THAT THEY “STOP KILLING US.”
WE DONT NEED SYMPATHY. WE NEED EVERYONE TO RESPECT OUR LIVES.
WERE GOING TO STAND UP AS A COMMUNITY AND FIGHT AGAINST ANYONE WHO BELIEVES THAT MURDER OR ANY VIOLENT ACTION BY THOSE WHO ARE SWORN TO PROTECT US SHOULD CONSISTENTLY GO UNPUNISHED.
THESE ROBBERIES OF LIVES MAKE US FEEL HELPLESS AND HOPELESS BUT WE HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT WE ARE FIGHTING FOR THE RIGHTS OF THE NEXT GENERATION, FOR THE NEXT YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO BELIEVE IN GOOD.
THIS IS A HUMAN FIGHT. NO MATTER YOUR RACE, GENDER OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION. THIS IS A FIGHT FOR ANYONE WHO FEELS MARGINALIZED, WHO IS STRUGGLING FOR FREEDOM AND HUMAN RIGHTS.
THIS IS NOT A PLEA TO ALL POLICE OFFICERS BUT TOWARD ANY HUMAN BEING WHO FAILS TO VALUE LIFE. THE WAR ON PEOPLE OF COLOR AND ALL MINORITIES NEEDS TO BE OVER.
FEAR IS NOT AN EXCUSE. HATE WILL NOT WIN.
WE ALL HAVE THE POWER TO CHANNEL OUR ANGER AND FRUSTRATION INTO ACTION. WE MUST USE OUR VOICES TO CONTACT THE POLITICIANS AND LEGISLATORS IN OUR DISTRICTS AND DEMAND SOCIAL AND JUDICIAL CHANGES.
WHILE WE PRAY FOR THE FAMILIES OF ALTON STERLING AND PHILANDO CASTILE, WE WILL ALSO PRAY FOR AN END TO THIS PLAGUE OF INJUSTICE IN OUR COMMUNITIES.

She was lost
In so many different ways
Out in the darkness with no guide
I know the cost of a losing hand
Never for the grace of God

Oh, I, I found heaven on Earth
You are my last, my first
And then I hear this voice inside
Ave Maria

Sometimes love can come
And pass you by
While youre busy making plans
Suddenly hits you
And then you realize
Its out of your hands
Baby you got to understand

And still youre in my heart
But youre the only one

Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe Ill get a chance to see you
When I close my eyes, Im going out of my head
Lost in a fairy tale, can you hold my hands and be my guide?

Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains; youre the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?

You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way, I dont wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your loves too good to be true
(Turn the lights on)
My guilty pleasure, I aint going nowhere
Baby, long as youre here, Ill be floating on air
Cause youre mine
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I dont wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)

Tattoo your name across my heart
So it will remain
Not even death could make us part
What kind of dream is this?
Tattoo your name across my heart
So it will remain
Not even death could make us part
What kind of dream is this?

Youre everything I thought you never were
And nothing like I thought you could’ve been
But still ,you live inside of me
So tell me how is that?
Youre the only one I wish I could forget
The only one Id love to not forgive
And though you break my heart, you’re the only one
And though there are times when I hate you
Cause I cant erase
The times that you hurt me
And put tears on my face
And even now while I hate you
It pains me to say
I know Ill be there at the end of the day

I dont wanna be without you, babe
I dont want a broken heart
Dont wanna take a breath without you, babe
I dont wanna play that part
I know that I love you
So let me just say
I don’t wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no
I don’t want a broken heart
And I dont wanna play the broken-hearted girl, no, no
No broken-hearted girl
This, no broken-hearted girl

Now I’m at a place I thought Id never be, ooh
Im living in a world thats all about you and me, yeah
Ain’t gotta be afraid, my broken heart is free
To spread my wings and fly away
Away with you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ohh, ohh, ohh

I dont wanna be without you, baby
I dont wanna a broken heart
Dont want to take a breath with out you, baby
I dont wanna play that part
I know that I love you
So let me just say
I dont wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no
I dont want a broken heart
I dont wanna play the broken-hearted girl, no, no, no

Te olvidé, te olvidé
Ya lo ves, ya lo ves
Ya lo ves amor esta vez te olvidé
En el closet, en un rincón están tus cosas
Esto se acabó (se acabó)
Te juro que no te aguanto más
No te quiero ya ni como amante
Esta vez no ganarás
Te puedes marchar y no vuelvas jamás
Y si acaso piensas que esta vez voy a perdonar
Ya verás que nunca más me vuelves a engañar
Ya lárgate…
¿Qué sabes tú de mí?
No me hagas reír
Tú creías que eras imprescindible
Pero sin tu amor no voy a morirme, baby
¿Qué sabes tú de mí?
No me hagas reír
Me verás con otro hombre a mi lado
Ya lo ves traidor voy a sustituirte
A olvidar tu amor…
Ya me curé del dolor
Ya te saqué de mi corazón
Vete con ella, solos los dos
Pobre de ti, lárgate me das asco
Tú eras mi luz, pero hay amores que matan de daño
Me cansé de ti
Ya no soy aquella infeliz
Y si acaso piensas que esta vez voy a perdonar
Ya verás que nunca más me vuelves a engañar
Ya lárgate…
¿Qué sabes tú de mí?
No me hagas reír
Tú creías que eras imprescindible
Pero sin tu amor no voy a morirme, baby
¿Qué sabes tú de mí?
No me hagas reír
Me verás con otro hombre a mi lado
Ya lo ves traidor voy a sustituirte
Voy a olvidar tu amor (voy a olvidar tu amor…)
Ya no soy nada para ti (voy a olvidar tu amor…)
Alguien que no conoces (conoces…)
Lo nuestro se acabó (se acabó…)
Tanto daño al fin lo destruyó (destruyó…)
Nunca lloraré por ti (lloraré por ti)
Porque ya me cansé de ti (ya me cansé de ti)
No eres más imprescindible
Ya lo ves, ya lo ves
Te olvidé, te olvidé
Hum…
Ya lo ves, ya lo ves
Ya lo ves amor esta vez te olvidé
Te olvidé, te olvidé
Ya lo ves traidor voy a sustituirte

Im a train wreck in the morning
Im  a bitch in the afternoon
Every  now and then without warning
I can be really mean towards you
Im a puzzle yes indeed
Ever  complex in every way
And  all the pieces arent even in the box
And yet, you see the picture clear as day

I  dont know why you love me
And thats why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me flaws and all
And  thats why I love you
And thats why I love you
And thats why I love you

I neglect you when Im working
When I need attention I tend to nag
Im a host of imperfection
And you see past all that
Im a peasant by some standards
But in your eyes Im a queen
You see potential in all my flaws
And thats exactly what I mean

I dont know why you love me
And thats why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me flaws and all
And thats why I love you
And yes, thats why I love you
And thats why I love you

Im a train wreck in the morning
Im a bitch in the afternoon
Every now and then without warning
I can be really mean towards you
I dont know why you love me
And thats why I love you

And thats why I love youEmbed

Dont you ring the alarm

But Ill be damned if I see another chick on your arm

She gon be rockin chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Benz and the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon take everything I own
If I let you go
I cant let you go
Damned if I let you go
She gone rock them VVS stones
If I let you go (Coupes)
In the Bach carter rolls
If I let you go
She go profit everything I taught
If I let you go
I cant let you go
Damned if let you go

Tell me how should I feel
When I know what I know
And my female intuition
Telling me you a dog
People told me bout the flames
I couldnt see through the smoke
When I need answers, accusations
What you mean you gone choke?

You cant stay, you gotta go
Aint no other chick spending ya dough
This is taking a toll
The way the story unfolds
Not the picture perfect movie everyone wouldve saw

But Ill be damned if I see another chick on your arm
Dont you ring the alarm
Ive been through this too long
But Ill be damned if I see another chick on your arm

Tell me how should I feel
When you made me belong
And the thought of you just touching her is what I hate most
I dont want you, but I want it and I cant let it go
To know you give it to her like you gave it to me, come on

(Oh)
Hes so arrogant and bold (Oh)
But she gon love that shit, I know
I done put in a call
Time to ring the alarm
Cause you aint never seen a fire like the one Im gon cause

She gon be rockin chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Benz and the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon take everything I own
If I let you go

How can you look at me
And not see all the things that I kept only just for you?
Why would you risk it, baby?
Is that the price I that pay?
But this is my show and I wont let you go
All its been paid for, and its mine
How could you look at me
And not see all the things?
(See all the things, see all the things)

Gravity cant begin
To pull me back to the ground again

Come between me and my family time and...
You keep me humble out of this hype
Cuz you know theres more to life
And if I need ya, you will be here
You will make the sacrifice
Dont fly me away
You dont need to buy a diamond key
To unlock my heart

Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe Ill get a chance to see you
When I close my eyes, Im going out of my head
Lost in a fairytale, can you hold my hands and be my guide?

Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains; youre the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?

You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way, I dont wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your loves too good to be true
(Turn the lights on)
My guilty pleasure, I aint going nowhere
Baby, long as youre here, Ill be floating on air
Cause youre mine
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I dont wanna wake up from you

I mention you when I say my prayers
I wrap you around all of my thoughts
Boy, youre my temporary high
I wish that when I wake up youre there
To wrap your arms around me for real
And tell me youll stay by my side

And I hope it rains; youre the perfect lullaby

She sleeps all day, dreams of you in both worlds
Grief, sedated by orgasm
Orgasm heightened by grief
God was in the room when the man said to the woman
I love you so much, wrap your legs around me and pull me in, pull me in, pull me in
Sometimes when hed have her nipple in his mouth, shed whisper Oh my God
That too is a form of worship
Her hips grind
Pestle and water, cinnamon and gloves
Whenever he pulls out, lost
Dear moon we blame you for floods, for the flush of blood
For men who are also wolves
We blame you for the night, for the dark, for the ghostsEmbed
At last
My love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a song
Oh yeah yeah
At last
The skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped up in clover
The night I looked at you
I found a dream
That I could speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never known
Oh yeah, when you smile
You smile, Ooh and then the spell was cast
And here we are in heaven
For you are mine
At last

Circle of life, and one day, I might not make it
Circle of life, and one day, I might not make it

When I need answers, accusations

Aint no other chick spending ya dough
This is taking a toll
The way the story unfolds
Not the picture perfect movie everyone wouldve saw

When youre gone, it feels like
My whole worlds gone with you
I thought love would be my cure
But now its my disease
I try to act mature
But Im a baby when you leave
How can I ever get used to being without you?

You say you gotta break away
That look in your eyes is making me nervous
Your smile
Your trying so hard not to feel helpless
When you first put it on me
I was hooked undeniably
But if you take that away from me
I wont know how to breathe

When youre gone, it feels like
My whole worlds gone with you
I thought love would be my cure
But now its my disease
I try to act mature
But Im a baby when you leave
How can I ever get used to being without you?

Every time I lose myself in your hands
I close my eyes, dont ever wanna be found again
And now you gotta leave me here
When I just got so addicted
To that sweet feeling

When youre gone, it feels like
My whole worlds gone with you
I thought love would be my cure
But now its my disease
I try to act mature
But Im a baby when you leave
How can I ever get used to being without you?

Heres what Im going through when youre gone
Some serious symptoms of withdrawal
Talking all night to my stupid pillow
Covering in my bed like an armadillo
Waiting for that call it makes me crave for your voice
When I get you on the phone oh I want you boy
Whenever we talk the more I feel incomplete
You just cant get what I need
When youre gone, it feels like
My whole worlds gone with you
I thought love would be my cure
But now its my disease
I try to act mature
But Im a baby when you leave
How can I ever get used to being without you?
Thought love would be my cure
But now its my diseaseEmbed

No Déjà Vu, just me and my- (OH!)

Baby, I cant go anywhere
Without thinking that youre there
Seems like youre everywhere, its true
Gotta be having Deja Vu

And Ill keep on clouded til we reach love again

Storms come without a warning
If we get through this tonight, we can make it to the morning, oh
Because if I cant be your girl

Then what kind of world would it be without you?
Like a mountain so high to reach
Said what kind of world?
Cause if we cant live in the sky
Then I might as well drown in the sea
(What kind of world?)
Finally my search is over and I found where I belong
But somehow we went wrong, oh

What kind of world?
(Ooh, what kind of world?)
What kind of world?
(Oh, if youre not here with me, oh)
See, the lesson Ive learned is that love is all
And I would tear to burn to be proven wrong
So I keep on searching, keep on preaching, keep on praying
And I cant give up til Im your girl

So what kind of world would it be without you?
Like a mountain so high to reach
(So tell me, ah)
Said what kind of world?
Cause if we cant live in the sky
Then I might as well drown in the sea
(What kind of world?)
Finally my search is over and I found where I belong
But somehow we went wrong, oh

What kind of world?
What kind of world?
What kind of world?

With hopes that maybe Ill get a chance to see you
When I close my eyes, Im going out of my head
Lost in a fairytale, can you hold my hands and be my guide?

Take one pint of water, add a half pound of sugar, the juice of eight lemons the zest of half lemon
Pour the water from one jug, then into the other, several times
Strain through a clean napkin
Grandmother, the alchemist
You spun gold out of this hard life
Conjured beauty from the things left behind
Found healing where it did not live
Discovered the antidote in your own kitchen
Broke the curse with your own two hands
You passed these instructions down to your daughter
Who then passed it down to her daughter
My grandma said, nothing real can be threatened
True love breathes salvation back into me
With every tear came redemption
And my torturer became my remedy
(I love...)
So were gonna heal, were gonna start again. Youve brought the orchestra
Synchronized swimmers, you are the magician. Pull me back together again the way you cut me in half
Make the woman in doubt disappear
Pull the sorrow from between my legs like silk, knot after knot after knot
The audience applauds but we cant hear them2Embed
Youre the only one that Papa allowed to hang out in my room
With the door closed, wed be alone
And mama never freaked out when she heard it go BOOM!
Cause she knew we were in the zone

Hold him in my arms and look out of my window

And he be keepin me calm so Id never let him go

And the bassline be rattlin through my see-eat, ee-eats
Then that crazy feeling starts happeni-ing- i-ing, OH!

I get butterflies when I hear the DJ (Playing the stuff I like)
And I fall deeper in love with every song he plays
Hes got a place in my heart

I think Im in love with my radio
Cause it never lets me down
And I fall in love with my stereo
Whenever I hear that sound

You know I got my top back and my beat low-oh
Rockin my stunna shades and turnin up my radio-oh
Turn up my radio, radio, radio....

If I let you go
She goin profit everything I taught
If I let you go

Damn, if let you go

And not see all the things that I kept only just for you?
Why would you risk it baby? Is that the price that I pay?
But this is my show and I wont let you go
All has been paid for, and its mine
How could you look at me
And not see all the things?
She go be rockin chinchilla coats

Getting the house off coast
If I let you go
She goin take everything I own
If I let you go
I cant let you go
Damn, if I let you go
She goin rock them VVS stones
If I let you go
Couped in the bach or the Rolls
If I let you go

What up, girl? Yeah
I hear all that
Thats real nice and all that
Its been, it been good though
Cause its been a year
Its been real good
Cause its been so good
And its summertime all over again
Tell me something

Out of all the guys that approach me
Walking up to me like they know me
You were the one that stayed aside
Waited a while and took your time
You dont know how impressing
Your curiosity was to me
It was the fourth day of July
Looked in my eyes and saw that I

I wanted more than just a man (Man)
I needed a friend (I want a friend)
Someone I can talk to (Oh)
Someone wholl really listen (Yeah)
When you touched my hand (Yeah)
The sun got brighter then
Trusting you I close my eyes
And felt our love begin

It was the summertime (When we fell in love)
It was the summertime (When heaven shined on us)
It was the summertime (Baby, there is nothing like the)
Summertime, summertime

Now its been a year and were closer
Fall in love again when I hold ya
I know that God set you aside
For me and now, you are my prize
Wanna grow old with ya
Fill our house with your pictures
Have a son for you, a little girl for me
Together well raise a family

I wanna understand everything you talk about, baby
Thats my word, cause I feel the same way (Best friend)
You know what I mean?
Ive been feeling this way for a long time too
And its like I wanna be a daddy
I wanna be your lover
Your everything, I just wanna share life with you
Just like you
Thats why I tell you I love you
I use to sit back and analyze on how we first met
A year ago on the barbershop steps
You and your friends walked past me
I called you back like, Come here, sexy. Have a word with you yet, please?
Congratulations on being my gift
God wrapped you up tight and he preserved my wish
Im not a psychic, its just that Im in tune with self
I swear the vibes got heavy when we got real close
Your whole demeanor caused me to ask questions
And stare at you strangely
Have I found my baby?
If so, do tell me now
Look like you was bout to say something, you just broke a smile
Gave me the number and I said Id dial (Yeah)
A year later, we on the block like bow
Tell me something, is it me, or we up to something?
Love to love ya, youre my friend and my woman

It was the summertime (When we fell in love)
It was the summertime (When heaven shined on us)
It was the summertime (Baby, there is nothing like the)
Summertime, summertime

This is Theodore, thats right
I keep hearing this all in my head over and over
I cant get it out, its crazy
You know what Im saying, baby?
This joint is real, I like that
Tell me something
It was the summertime (When we fell in love)
It was the summertime (When heaven shined on us)
It was the summertime (Baby, there is nothing like the)
Summertime, summertime (Oh)Embed
Im in this fight and Im swingin, and my arms are getting tired
Im tryna beat this emptiness, but Im runnin out of time
Im sinkin in the sand and I can barely stand
Im lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
Im scared of lonely
I try to be patient, but Im hurtin deep inside
And I cant keep waitin, I need comfort late at night
And I cant find my way, wont you lead me home?
Cause Im lost in this dream
I need you to hold me

Im scared of lonely
And Im scared of being the only
Shadow I see along the wall
And Im scared the only heartbeat
I hear beating is my own
And Im scared of being alone
I cant seem to breathe when I am lost in this dream
I need you to hold me

Im scared of lonely
Im scared of lonely

I cry at night, cause my babys too far to be by my side
To wipe away these tears of mine, so I hold my pillow tight
To imagine you outstretch your hand, looking for mine
Cause Im lost in this dream
I need you to hold me

Im scared of lonely
And Im scared of being the only
Shadow I see along the wall
And Im scared the only heartbeat
I hear beating is my own
And Im scared of being alone
I cant seem to breathe when I am lost in this dream
I need you to hold me

I need your strength when nobody is around
Cause Im tired of this emptiness, I think Im drowning
I cant be lonely no more
And Im lost in this dream
I need you to hold me

Im scared of lonely
And Im scared of being the only
Shadow I see along the wall
And Im scared the only heartbeat
I hear beating is my own
And Im scared of being alone
I cant seem to breathe when I am lost in this dream

My love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a song
Oh yeah yeah
At last
The skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped up in clover
The night I looked at you
I found a dream
That I could speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never known
Oh yeah, when you smile
You smile, Ooh and then the spell was cast
And here we are in heaven
For you are mine
At lastEmbed

Satellites flashing by
Its a beautiful state were in
But how can we love in isolation?
Think how happy we can be when we just try
Were nothing like we seem
Passionate words are never spoken
You dont know how I bleed
When I leave your side

In your eyes, loves alive
Youve come untied
Cause were flashing by
Like satellites
Satellites

Take all the rulеs away
How can we live if we dont changе?
Were always on display
Lets run and hide

In our eyes, loves alive
Weve come untied
Cause were flashing by
Like satellites
Satellites

If we dont communicate
Well exist in our own space
We have all the love we need
While were apart, I cannot breathe

Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe Ill get a chance to see you
When I close my eyes, Im going out of my head
Lost in a fairytale, can you hold my hands and be my guide?

Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains; youre the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?

You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way, I dont wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your loves too good to be true
(Turn the lights on)
My guilty pleasure, I aint going nowhere
Baby, long as youre here, Ill be floating on air
Cause youre mine
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I dont wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)

I mention you when I say my prayers
I wrap you around all of my thoughts
Boy, youre my temporary high
I wish that when I wake up youre there
To wrap your arms around me for real
And tell me youll stay by my side

Clouds filled with stars cover the skies (Cover the skies)
And I hope it rains; youre the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?

Tattoo your name across my heart
So it will remain
Not even death could make us part
What kind of dream is this?

You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I dont wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your loves too good to be true
(Turn the lights on)
My guilty pleasure, I aint going nowhere
Baby, long as youre here, Ill be floating on air
Cause youre mine
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I dont wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)
Either way I dont wanna wake up from youEmbed

Ring the alarm
Ive been through this too long
But Ill be damned if I see another chick on your arm
Dont you ring the alarm
Ive been through this too long
But Ill be damned if I see another chick on your arm

She gon be rockin chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Benz and the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon take everything I own
If I let you go
I cant let you go
Damned if I let you go
She gone rock them VVS stones
If I let you go (Coupes)
In the Bach carter rolls
If I let you go
She go profit everything I taught
If I let you go
I cant let you go
Damned if let you go

Tell me how should I feel
When I know what I know
And my female intuition
Telling me you a dog
People told me bout the flames
I couldnt see through the smoke
When I need answers, accusations
What you mean you gone choke?

You cant stay, you gotta go
Aint no other chick spending ya dough
This is taking a toll
The way the story unfolds
Not the picture perfect movie everyone wouldve saw

She gon be rockin chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Benz and the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon take everything I own
If I let you go
I cant let you go
Damned if I let you go
She gone rock them VVS stones
If I let you go (Coupes)
In the Bach carter rolls
If I let you go
She go profit everything I taught
If I let you go
I cant let you go
Damned if let you go
Ring the alarm
Ive been through this too long
But Ill be damned if I see another chick on your arm
Dont you ring the alarm
Ive been through this too long
But Ill be damned if I see another chick on your arm

Tell me how should I feel
When you made me belong
And the thought of you just touching her is what I hate most
I dont want you, but I want it and I cant let it go
To know you give it to her like you gave it to me, come on

(Oh)
Hes so arrogant and bold (Oh)
But she gon love that shit, I know
I done put in a call
Time to ring the alarm
Cause you aint never seen a fire like the one Im gon cause

She gon be rockin chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Benz and the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon take everything I own
If I let you go
I cant let you go
Damned if I let you go
She gone rock them VVS stones
If I let you go (Coupes)
In the Bach carter rolls
If I let you go
She go profit everything I taught
If I let you go
I cant let you go
Damned if let you go
How can you look at me
And not see all the things that I kept only just for you?
Why would you risk it, baby?
Is that the price I that pay?
But this is my show and I wont let you go
All its been paid for, and its mine
How could you look at me
And not see all the things?
(See all the things, see all the things)

She gon be rockin chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Benz and the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon take everything I own
If I let you go
I cant let you go
Damned if I let you go
She gone rock them VVS stones
If I let you go (Coupes)
In the Bach carter rolls
If I let you go
She go profit everything I taught
If I let you go
I cant let you go

All the ladies, if you feel me, help me sing it out
Here you go, trippin
Everything is cool between us, Bey
I told you that
Out on the road wit my people, just doin what I gotta do
There’s nothin goin on that shouldnt be goin on
You got to trust me, Ma

I cant believe I believed everything we had would last
So young and naive of me to think she was from your past
Silly of me to dream of one day havin your kids
Love is so blind, it feels right when its wrong

I cant believe I fell for your schemes, Im smarter than that
So dumb and naive to bеlieve that with me, yourе a changed man
Foolish of me to compete when you cheat with loose women
It took me some time, but now I moved on
Because I realized Ive got

Me, myself, and I
Thats all I got in the end
Thats what I found out
And it aint no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on, Im gon be my own best friend
Me, myself, and I
Thats all I got in the end
Thats what I found out
And it aint no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on, Im gon be my own best friend

Youre so controlling, you say that you love me but you dont
Your family told me one day I would see it on my own
Next thing I know, Im dealing with your three kids in my home
Love is so blind, it feels right when its wrong

Now that its over, stop callin me
Come pick up your clothes
Aint no need to front like youre still with me
All your homies know
Even your very best friend tried to warn me on the low
Took me some time, but now I am strong
Because I realized Ive got

Me, myself, and I
Thats all I got in the end
Thats what I found out
And it aint no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on, Im gon be my own best friend
Me, myself, and I
Thats all I got in the end
Thats what I found out
And it aint no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on, Im gon be my own best friend
(Ive got me, myself, and I)
I know that I will never disappoint myself
(My eyes have cried a thousand times)
All the ladies, if you feel me, help me sing it out
(I cant regret time spent with you)
Yeah, you hurt me, but I learned a lot along the way
(Its how I learned how to make it through)
After all the rain, youll see the sun come out again
(Now Ive got me, myself, and I)
Hey, I know that I will never disappoint myself
(My eyes have cried a thousand times)
Ive cried

Satellites flashing by
Its a beautiful state were in
But how can we love in isolation?
Think how happy we can be when we just try
Were nothing like we seem
Passionate words are never spoken
You dont know how I bleed
When I leave your side

In your eyes, loves alive
Youve come untied
Cause were flashing by
Like satellites
Satellites

Take all the rules away
How can we live if we dont change?
Were always on display
Lets run and hide

In our eyes, loves alive
Weve come untied
Cause were flashing by
Like satellites
Satellites

If we dont communicate
Well exist in our own space
We have all the love we need
While were apart, I cannot breathe

Even just for a day
I’d roll outta bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted and go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I’d kick it with who I wanted
And I’d never get confronted for it
Cause they’d stick up for me
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I’d be a better man
I’d listen to her
Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
Cause he’s taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed
If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it’s broken
So they’d think that I was sleepin’ alone
I’d put myself first
And make the rules as I go
Cause I know that she’d be faithful
Waitin’ for me to come home
To come home
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I’d be a better man
I’d listen to her
Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
Cause he’s taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed
Its a little too late for you to come back
Say its just a mistake
Think Id forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong
But you’re just a boy
You don’t understand
Yeah, you don’t understand
How it feels to love a girl, someday
You wish you were a better man
You don’t listen to her
You don’t care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
Cause you’ve taken her for granted
And everything you have got destroyed
But you’re just a boy
I want you to know that Im happy for you
I wish nothing but the best for you both
An older version of me
Is she perverted like me
Would she go down on you in a theatre
Does she speak eloquently
And would she have your baby
Im sure shed make a really excellent mother
Cause the love that you gave that we made
Wasnt able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name
Does she know how you told me youd hold me
Until you died, til you died
But youre still alive

And Im here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
Its not fair to deny me of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know
You seem very well, things look peaceful
Im not quite as well, I thought you should know
Did you forget about me Mr. Duplicity
I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner
It was a slap in the face how quickly I was replaced
Are you thinking of me when you fuck her
Cause the love that you gave that we made
Wasnt able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name
Does she know how you told me youd hold me
Until you died, til you died
But youre still alive

Diamonds used to be coal
Look young cause they got soul
That’s why theyre beautiful
And my heart used to be cold
Til your hands laid on my soul
Baby, that’s why youre beautiful

Im not wondering why
The skys blue; thats not my business
All I know is I
Look up and tell myself
Be patient, love. That could be us.

Lovers used to make love
And died just to give us
Their piece of the beautiful
Remember when we made love?
Love
Wasnt it beautiful?

Dont ask me why
The skys blue; that’s not my business
All I know is I
Look up and tell myself
Be patient, love. That could be us.

Diamonds used to be coal (Be coal)

Ooh

Thats why youre beautiful

К небу тянутся руки, теперь для меня все девушки суки
К небу тянутся руки, я понял, что ты была со мной от скуки
Но к небу тянутся руки, сегодня я жив, а может быть умер
Тебе будет похуй на это, тебе будет похуй на это
К небу тянутся руки, прошу дорогая, давай всё забудем
К небу тянутся руки, и я вновь хочу забыть друг о друге
Но к небу тянутся руки, тебе хорошо, а я снова я в мукке
К небу тянутся руки, к небу тянутся руки
К небу тянутся руки, тебе же тогда напиздели
И мне ща вообще на всё похуй, я щас с другою в постели
К небу тянутся руки, теперь для меня все девушки суки
К небу тянутся руки, я понял, что ты была со мной от скуки
Но к небу тянутся руки, сегодня я жив, а может быть умер
Тебе будет похуй на это, тебе будет похуй на это
К небу тянутся руки, прошу дорогая, давай всё забудем
К небу тянутся руки, и я вновь хочу забыть друг о друге
Но к небу тянутся руки, тебе хорошо, а я снова я в мукке
К небу тянутся руки, к небу тянутся руки
К небу тянутся руки, тебе же тогда напиздели
И мне ща вообще на всё похуй, я щас с другою в постелиEmbed
